= = = Boston accent = = =
The Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English. It is spoken specifically in the city of Boston, its suburbs, and much of eastern Massachusetts. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire and Maine. The accent originated with the Puritans who came to the area from East Anglia in the 17th century. It was also influenced by 19th and 20th century immigrants from Ireland. This resulted in the distinct r-dropping (locally called "wicked natural") dialect found in modern costal Massachusetts.
Non-rhoticity.
The traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers tend to use more of a rhotic accent than older speakers from the Boston region. The Boston accent is pronounced with a “broad A”. The letter "r" is dropped only in certain words like 'car' and 'hard'. For example, a person might “pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.”
Lexicon.
Some words used in the Boston area are:

City ordinance 176874, adopted September 4, 2002, sets the design and what it means. Green stands for "the forests and our green City"; yellow for "agriculture and commerce"; blue for "our rivers". Portland is on the Willamette River near its joining with the Columbia River. City Ordinance 186794, adopted September 3, 2014, updated the proportions and the Pantone color specifications: White, PMS 279 (Blue); PMS 349 (Green); and PMS 1235 (Yellow).
The flag was designed in 1969 by a longtime Portland resident, graphic designer R. Douglas Lynch (1913–2009). The version of the flag adopted at that time included, over Lynch's objections, a dark blue canton containing the city seal in yellow and white; in 2002 Lynch and fellow members of the Portland Flag Association persuaded the city council to simplify the design to better reflect his original intent.

= = = Flash Airlines Flight 604 = = =
Flash Airlines Flight 604, a Boeing 737-300, was a flight from Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to Paris, France, via Cairo. On January 3, 2004 the plane crashed into the Red Sea just moments after take-off at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. All 135 passengers and 13 crew members on-board the plane died. The cause of the crash remains disputed, but it was suggested to be spatial disorientation by the Captain.
The crash remains Egypt's deadliest air-disaster, until the bombing of Kogalymavia Flight 9268, with 224 deaths. The crash is also the worst crash of a Boeing 737-300.
The flight took off at 04:44 Eastern European Time (0244 GMT) from runway 22R at the Egyptian resort en route to Paris via Cairo. After taking off, the aircraft should have climbed and initiated a left turn to follow the air corridor to Cairo designated by the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. The captain appeared surprised when the autopilot was engaged, which he immediately switched off again. The copilot warned the captain that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right, the captain said "OK come out".
The ailerons were briefly returned to neutral before being commanded to increase the bank to the right, likely by the captain in a state of surprise. The aircraft reached an altitude of 5,460 feet (1,660 m) with a 50-degree bank when the copilot exclaimed "Overbank" repeatedly when the bank angle kept increasing. The bank angle was 111 degrees right, while the pitch attitude was 43 degrees nose down at an altitude of 3,470 feet (1,060 m).
The observer on the flight deck, also a pilot, but a trainee on this 737 variant, shouted "Retard power, retard power, retard power", to get the captain to pull the throttles back so that the aircraft stopped gaining speed. Both throttles were moved to idle; the captain appeared to regain control of the airplane. However the speed increased, activating the overspeed warning.
At 04:45, the aircraft impacted the water about 8.2 nautical miles (15.2 km) south of the airport. The impact occurred while the aircraft was in a 24 degree right bank, 24 degree nose-down attitude, travelling at 416 knots (770 km/h, 478 mph,) and pulling 3.9g (38 m/22). All 148 passengers and crew were lost.
Most of the passengers aboard the flight were French tourists from the Paris metropolitan area. A provisional passenger list, dated January 5 January 2004, stated that twelve entire French families had boarded the flight.

= = = Jacques I, Prince of Monaco = = =
Jacques Goÿon, Count of Matignon ("Jacques François Léonor"; 21 November 1689 – 23 April 1751) was Count of Thorigny and Matignon. He was also the Prince of Monaco as Jacques I after his marriage to Princess Louis Hippolyte of Monaco. He also built the Hôtel Matignon.
Life.
Jacques was born in Normandy. His father was the Count of Matignon. Jacques became the Count of Matignon in 1675 when his father died. Jacques married Princess Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi of Monaco.
Issue.

Oh I don't know I'm sure  say anything rude.
No  honest.
Do they?
some voices aren't allowed to er appear.
Are you still in here?
It it's okay carry on it's alright I'm, I  
Right.
Okay I'm sorry I haven't had level three supervision groups before so this is a whole new experience for me 
Well we're very high powered you know  
Chris has given me my instructions so 
Oh no 
I'm supposed to first say is th are you finding the course okay and to ask you about your projects.
So course okay so far?
supervisor.
So Mike have you got your project sorted out?
Well it's more or less in hand, yeah.
What what you're doing?
Yeah 
With Stewart?
yeah.
So is it just a continuation of what you've done anyway?
Well more or less but he weren't amused at any of the results so 
Oh I see right.
I've  got to start again .
That's rotten.
So are y are you just do 
No it's quite fair actually.
are you just doing are you just doing one er sorry j er are you just doing one project  a t a two term project?
Yeah.
Right so you're s you're sorted out.
Charles what are you doing?
Er I'm doing something on wild salmon.
Oh right.
Who, who are you er with?
Er with Gordon.
?
Yeah.
Oh right, so what are you, tell us about it, what are you going to do?
Erm well  Alex and I are both doing it but Alex has got his own rivers  so he's doing it on his own sort of thing 
Alex 
and er I'm  I'm, think I'm doing mine more sort of related to er the eggs.
Right.
So where 
Well sort of looking in that, that s er on the Tyne.
Oh right.
So I mean is this eggs that are put in by the, I mean I 
Er yeah I think it will have something to do with that, yeah.
I've sort of er I've
So are you just doing a lit is it, is it a two term project as well?
Yeah.
And you're just starting a  research?
Yeah.
Right.
I've started that, I've gotta, just gotta  I went and played on the computers yesterday.
You went what?
And played on the computers yesterday  
Oh right, oh right.
Have you all, by the way have you all tried this C D rom thing
Mm
in the library?
It's quite fun.
It's quite fun, have you tried that?
Yeah that's what I tried yesterday.
Has anyone got anything useful out of it yet?
No it's  
Yeah I know but they're not exactly over run with them are they?
in the library or down here we have to do  
Have you got to be more specific with your requests?
I haven't tried it.
Well probably but it do it s I mean it, you either put in  I, I mean I  most, most 
You're doing  
most of the things that I've done have been on Atlantic salmon and you put in Atlantic salmon and you get seven thousand eight hundred 
Yeah.
and forty abstracts out  
Right 
forget that.
And you narrow it down and you get zero.
Oh right, right.
Right, so you've got to play about with the system a bit more?
I think so I think so.
Right.
ASFA I think it's more helpful I think than C D rom isn't it?
What's the difference between ASFA and C D rom?
It's spelt different.
No but ASFA is just on the  scientific end

Oh.
You can ask him if it's alright to keep you in your tablets.
I'm going to start .
I tell you when I was in here it was just keeping calm.
And I'd no been to  bloody.
Aye well  Nothing Doctor  can do,
I know but he .
He would need to go up and see .
Doctor 
Ah.
What's up with young John today?
Oh my  Strathclyde Hospital on Wednesday,
Aha.
and they er sort of X-rayed me, took a urine sample, took a blood sample, er Doctor
Aha.
He examined me.
Erm he f he found, know how they were wrong about a slight murmur on my heart?
Mhm.
He couldn't find it.
He says it could have been  anxiety
Mhm.
or 
hospital
Aye just
So there was nothing really 
nothing to worry about.
Good.
I'm delighted to hear that.
But he did say that er it'll take three weeks before he can get back to me about sending me to the Law  
Mhm.
He says that, see the biopsy and the other?
Yeah.
He says that I might not need to get it right?
Because he, he'll be able to tell off my blood.
Mhm.
So he, he's still to decide about that.
Yeah.
Right.
Aye, and he also agreed with you about the lump in my back.
Mhm.
Right?
Yeah.
And he s he said the same as you, that er
If it's not bothering you, leave it alone.
Aye.
Said the exact same as you.
Oh aye.
Och aye.
It's not, not sensible.
Now then.
Here you are young John.
Honestly, I'm gutted with this cold the noo, could you give me
Mhm.
Yeah,
something for it?
sure.
How're you doing with the, the drink?
Oh.
I have my good days and bad days.
How many good ones and how bad ones?
during the day.
Too many bad ones.
I just cannae seem to get off it at all.
Well, keep it down as low as you can because the lower you keep it, the less chance there is of getting this biopsy done.
I thought they were just going to X-ray me back, but they X-rayed everything.
Oh they would do.
They done the lot,
Yeah.
front, back, side.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
There you are John, And 
Right.
that'll get you rid of that.
Doctor  
Aye, we're really worried about him now.
He's getting worse.
Aye.
I mean see last night, we went to bed last night, he came in at noon didn't he?
I'm moving out.
I'm moving out, I'm going to go stay at me granny's.
I cannae stick my dad.
I'm just, I'm just moving out and er I just cannae cope any more.
They're 
Mhm.
everybody's talking about me.
Mhm.
I mean I, see the tablets you gave him?
Mhm.
I've got them.
Mhm.
I'm actually scared.
He's threatened, just a couple of times to take an overdose.
I'm scared to  too
Mhm.
Right.
too many at the one you know what I mean?
He's seeing Doctor  and
I was wondering if you'd heard anything from Doctor  ?
Doctor   what, if that happens Doctor  says that the next time he wants to see us along with him.
Mhm.
Yeah yeah.
Because he's worrying us.
Yeah.
See I don't know if it's just part real  or if he's just trying to frighten me.
Mhm.
It could be.
This i this is the thing, with youngsters like that, you never know.
I mean he doesn't want for nothing, he gets as much as I can give him.
It's nothing it's nothing to do 
He's got, he's got everything he could want.
Aye, it's nothing to do with wanting.
I mean see my see my next door neighbours, they're good
Mhm.
neighbours aren't they?
We don't even take any money off him for keep 
Aye.
or anything like that.
And he came in
let him keep everything.
he's sitting he's sitting in the living room on Sunday night.
Now these new wheely-bins, you take a turn each.
Mhm.
I'll just take the two, and Billy'll take them out the next week.
Mhm.
But on Sunday night we weren't in, and Billy looked in the kitchen.
We were at a night out.
He must have looked in the kitchen window.
Just to see
Mhm.
whether to take the bins out or not.
But our John was sitting reading the paper.
He's got a, they're all talking about me, he says they're listening at the walls or standing in the clossies 
Mhm.
I mean the things he's coming away with aren't real.
Aye.
Why is he seeing Doctor  ?
He's .
He's gonna see him again, don't get me wrong, Doctor  said he'll send for the both of us, right?
Mhm.
But he's getting to the point where I'm ready for saying to him away you go down to your granny's right, but my mam cannae live with him either.
No no.
Cos she's the same way.
She's phoning me.
She 
I think Doctor  only sits once a month, and  
Oh no.
No.
No.
Every week.
Is it every week?
Is it?
Mhm.
I thought it was only once a month.
No.
See when he's thing, you see when he's er down at his granny's, my mummy and my daddy are actually talking round about him trying to kid on that they're, they're ignoring him.
They they try to ignore him.
Know what I mean?
Mm.
Right.
I'll get on to him and we'll soon get this .
See I cannae walk by a bus stop.
There're two people at a bus stop, they two people's talking about him.
Yeah.
The night that they brought him up here.
A man walked in and he says hello to John and that and how's it going and that, he came into see you and I sat, I mean I came in 
Mhm.
out of the road, what's that man saying about me?
Aye I heard him saying how do you put up with an arsehole like that?
Thinks, he's paranoid.
He thinks everybody's talking about him.
Aye.
You know what I mean?
But this has just come on.
Mhm.
Oh aye.
This is how it comes.
This is how it comes, just
And I mean  I'm not wanting to make up any .
Ah but Doctor , it's plain to you, John's 
It may be the best thing for him.
John has been  put under psychologist because he was slow at school right?
Aha.
Aye.
And this is the start.
This is what's in his head.
He's no equal with anybody else.
Yet 
Ah.
he is cos we paid dear.
Yes yes yes.
But this is the thing, if he doesn't go there, if he needs to go there and he doesn't go there, he's going to get worse.
Aye.
Aye.
I mean he's going to get worse and worse and worse.
See, the way I feel I've, it's not a case
She even thinks
I know there was  
see because he w he was slow, he had trouble with learning 
Mhm.
at school, right?
Mhm.
See he  
S he thinks that all the ones that were at school with him are s talking 
about him.
Mhm.
That's right 
Still yet.
that's what he said, the first night he came in.
Aye.
The f the thing is if he needs to go in for treatment, he's only going to get worse if he doesn't get it.
But he'll say to me 
I said that and all.
But as I, like you know John when he talks about it.
If they found out 
I'm up there like I'm just going to stay up there, I'm never mind to come back here.
Do you know, she went to the bingo yesterday  her mother, right?
For that day out at the bingo with her mam.
And er he roa er he ranted for three hours too.
Mhm.
Kept repeating himself and, right?
Yeah.
And I'm sitting watching the telly trying to watch a film.
Tell him what happened with the police 
the police a fortnight ago.
I had to send for the police.
Mm.
Because he didn't 
I thought he was I thought he was going to do something to himself.
Or smash up the house or something.
See he smashed up the house on Christmas day.
Aha.
But he never 
For no reason at all,
Aye.
right.
Er then he, he, I sent for the police because he walked out the door and he, he threatened to kill himself.
I had to get the police to get him back.
See and I don't know whether he's tormenting us, or whether he's
Oh, you never know.
You cannae take the chance.
And I've got every tablet.
Even his.
Mhm.
I've got  of them all.
You can't, I mean there's, there's no way you can take a chance on it, Flora.
I mean if he's just  
I mean he's, he's the only kid we've got, and he's been 
Aye.
spoilt, you know what I mean?
It's no as if we've 
Doesn't, doesn't matter who it is.
Doesn't matter what age they are.
I mean, we've had them doing this at eight year old.
Aye.
And I've seen them doing this right up till they're in their eighties.
Do you think if I, do you think if I gave him a fright,s see the, time he says he's going off to his granny's and I say away you go, and my mam says she's not taking him.
Would you would you like to take the chance?
No.
I wouldn't either.
I know he's starting all these things, see his computers and that?
S maybe if I says to him away you go to your granny's and then and you're not taking anything with you.
No?
No.
It's not worth the risk Flora.
If he did anything
Well that night he walked out I was  wasn't I?
Mhm.
And he must have been, I've a feeling he was standing somewhere bloody well
Watching you.
Aye.
watching me.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
I mean,i if he, if you said something like that to him and he went away and he didn't turn up for two or three days, you would never live with yourself.
Maybe that 
Exactly.
Oh no.
No no.
Ju hold on.
Leave it with me.
I'll get in touch with Doctor .
Hope we'll get it organized as quick as we can.
Right, thanks Doctor .
Okay?
Right.
Right, thanks Doctor.
Okay, right Flora.
Right.
Don't do anything
I wouldn't.
Aye.
o okay.
Right then.
Right.
Right, cheerio now.

Right can you have a look  at those  Just have at the answers to this.
Did you find any difficulties at all?
N no I don't .
It looks all right from here.
Yeah.
Keep the tracing paper if you need it.
That's all right.
yes that's okay that's fine.
Hang on.
Oh yes alright from there.
How did you come to that conclusion?
What ?
the petrol station   the petrol station, isn't it?
Mm.
Mm  five minutes.
It's five minutes and fifteen.
I misread the .
That's okay.
in the first fifteen minutes of the journey   Yeah er    What's fifteen minutes  as part of an hour?
Quarter of a hour.
Quarter of an hour.
That's point two five.
Mm.
You can't
Mm.
You can't have time as a decimal, time is not a decimal.
Mm.
Okay?
I can't remember what it's called it's in sixties whatever that is.
Mhm.
Yeah.
S Time is not a decimal so you can't operate time as a decimal.
Nobody ever used to make that mistake at one time you know why?
No.
Because everything worked was wasn't in decimal.
Mm.
All the distances were in twelves 
Mm.
and for and weights were in fourteens so 
Aha.
nobody ever thought about anything being a decimal.
Mhm.
So nobody had any problems with that.
No of course that everything's de- you know everything's decimal time
Yeah.
becomes quite an awkward calculation.
It didn't used to be.
It didn't.   not been interrupted.
same constant speed.
So you work the same the constant speed.
.
Yeah w shouldn't matter ,
yeah.
that's fine.
Aha.
Doesn't make any difference at all that doesn't.
Erm so you would have done  er yeah then you've got You've got your speed of distance over time correctly.
Mm.
Or time is distance over speed.
It's all right, but  you've then  gone that's not nought point two five minutes the speed's per hour.
Isn't it?
Mm.
The speed is per hour  isn't it?
So that would have been  point two five which should have been fifteen minutes.
Yes that's sixtieth of an hour 
Which is point two five of an hour.
Be very careful with your 
Mm.
units.
Yeah.
That's
Mm.
The calculation's fine what you've done's fine just mucked 
Put the wrong 
the units up.
Yeah.
Right?
So that's  How many minutes earlier?
Now you've not done that you've actually done his journey time .
Mm.
Mm?
So careful read the question.
You must read the question!
Alright, how're you getting on with them?
Or have I stopped you?
Didn't know what I'm supposed to be doing with that .
Your supposed to be doing them rotate them through Do this one first.
How do you mean  them?
Hundred and eighty degree rotation around C.
doing it Do you mean drawing it on Using this drawing it?
Yeah.
You've done rotations and reflections and so forth haven't you?
Mm.
Mhm.
that rotated a hundred and eighty degrees about that.
Mm.
brought it by  isn't it?
But I know what to do I don't know what you want me to do.
I want it I want it shown as a hundred and eighty degree rotation.
There's an exam question  Rotate that
Yeah.
about that point the hu Through a hundred and eighty degrees .
Mm.
four.
What your not so  Fine.
Yeah.
Okay yes good.
That's alright.
Use the patterns to write down  the A three.
A Three is that that that that that.
A four    Lets have a look.
Is it done?
No I haven't done anything yet I'm on .
Look
I can't do it!
I can't .
You haven't done rotations have you?
Yeah I have but I don't how to do them like this I've not seen it been d drawn out like that.
Right draw something from the centre of rotation to the the figure.
Mm.
Rotate that bit through a hundred and eighty degrees where's it go?
Over here.
Over there.
There's a hundred 
Yes.
and eighty innit?
Trace the original.
Yes.
Mm.
Round the centre of rotation  it to the spoke while she's up the other spoke.
Dum.
Mm.
Mm?
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
it's as simple as that.
Isn't it?
.
Go on then.
as if you've drawn.
Have you got a pencil?
No I was looking at the other one.
No I want it actually done I want you 
to physically do 'em .
Right erm 
So they go into your brain
Mm.
via your eyes and and 
finger ends and so forth.
Mhm.
Okay?
Mhm.
I suppose I should put Nyah Right okay simultaneous equations.
Yeah.
With some degree of er  success I trust this time.
I think I messed number one up.
Ah dear.
Yes you did.
You know why?
No.
You made the classic mistake the only mistake there is here you multiply everything by two
Mm.
So that's twenty six.
Mm.
That's the only I mean that's th that's the real problem with this thing It's one the the difficulties you end up with You see you must remember to multiply everything that's there by the number you want to multiply, not just half of it.
And that's all the problem is.
I think I've done the others right.
Yes that looks alright.
Yeah.
Well you can always tell can't you?
How do you tell?
St st st just stick 
Go back and check it  
the numbers back in.
Just put the numbers back in.
Yeah it's alright.
Yeah it's alright.
You see you managed to  plough through these quite r readily did you?
Sort of.
Ah.
What on earth's that question?
Two A plus
Oh it's an A is it?
Oh I beg your pardon sorry
I changed it to  .
That's al that's alright that's alright I'm with that.
I understand what you're doing it's a substitution.
It's a little like As and Bs.
Er it doesn't make any difference does it?
No but I'm used to Xs and Ys.
Yes but A Yeah that's alright erm except for examples  we where do up to?
Ten.
Up to ten.
Yes.
Have a go at fourteen and sixteen.
Whilst I sit here and admire your expertise and 
Ha.
general  facility at this subject.
Mm.
And say to yourself
Nine seven nine C plus 
Yep.
Or four Y minus minus nine.
Yeah.
Which is probably as good.
Thirteen.
Thirteen is right.
twenty six 
That's okay.
Y equals 
Y equals  What're you gonna do?
Divide it.
Yeah, whoa.
Right it's two isn't it?
Mm.
Okay.
Substitute that back in .
Yes that's right.
Yes.
Do number seventeen.
But I haven't done sixteen.
Just do number seventeen I fancy seventeen better than number sixteen.
Mhm, you would.
I know.
I have this great in-built desire to make people suffer.
There's an easier way of doing it isn't there?
What get rid of the Ys?
Yes.
Mm.
Suppose so.
Yeah there is is There's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two aren't you?
Yeah.
You must look at this from the minimum of Point of view of the minimum amount of labour.
Yeah.
Equals twenty six.
No it doesn't.
I beg your pardon yes it does..
Mm.
Yes it does.
You're right.
That's right.
and X equals 
Thirty three.
Yeah.
Alright we  need to bother a I know you I know you can do substitution.
Yeah thing about it is though when you're looking at this, you wanna be looking as to which is the Produces the smallest numbers.
mm.
And which produces the minimum amount of manipulation and that was that the second one wasn't it?
Yeah.
You had much less to do than anything else.
Mm.
Right that's unfortunate.
That I l I've forgotten to bring the other work.
However.
Can I Can I just interrupt and say I've forgotten .
I'm sorry is that enough?
Yes.
thank you.
Eye's funny.
Yeah.
Now look it asks you for a certain number of things It says As The average doesn't it?
How 
Yes.
Do you work t an average?
Average is all the tests added together
Yeah,
divide by the number of tests he had.
That's right.
So what's the total for all his test?
Hundred and twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six how many tests had he had?
X.
X.
So the average is going to be?
Hundred and twenty five divide by x.
Hundred an Is it a hundred and twenty five?
twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six divided by X is that.
Yeah.
So what's difficult about that?
Nothing.
So.
Now there's another two tests.
Yeah.
So what's the total now?
Hundred and twenty eight  divide by
Where's a hundred and twenty eight come from?
What's the total marks for the next two tests?
Oh.
You're told what the marks are for the next two tests aren 
Oh nine and eight.
Nine and eight aren't they?
Yeah.
So what's the total marks for the Now for the the tests?
How many marks you got all together?
Hundred and   twenty thirty  forty   forty two .
Mm.
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
No!
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
Come on what's nine add six ?
Hundred and thirty six.
O What's nine add six?
Eleven.
Nine add six?
Oh  Fourteen.
And another one.
Six 
fifteen yeah?
Yes.
Six and nine it's always one less when innit when you're adding nine?
So it's fifteen do it's a hundred and twenty six plus nine is?
hundred and thirty forty.
I want a hundred and twenty six plus nine!
Oh a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty  five.
Hundred and thirty five.
What's five and eight?
Not
Thirteen.
Thirteen so the answer's gonna be a hundred and?
Forty three.
Hundred and forty three.
You know what the a en end number's gonna be every time i Don't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Hundred and forty three.
That's right so the total's a hundred and forty three.
So what's the what's the average gonna be or even the mean?
Hundred and forty three  divide by 
By 
X plus two.
Splendid.
Can we have it written down like real mathematicians?
Ah wonderful.
Wonderful.
hundred and forty five.
Yes No I said a hundred and forty 
Forty three 
three yes.
Over 
Divide by X plus two .
plus two that's right.
Now what's the next part of the question say?
If if a If his average for the first X test was one greater than his average for
X plus two tests .
plus two tests .
Use results of one and two 
To form the equation and find the value of X. 
Now what it just said  think of another way of saying that.
Work out what X is.
No you can't work out what X is you haven't got a c hope of working out wh 
Form an equation.
Form an equation.
But what's one side of the equation going to be?
Hundred and twenty six divide by X.
Plus?
Hundred and fort 
No no
plus two
No no read what it says.
If his average for the first X tests is one greater than the average  Sorry beg your pardon I've got it round me  round me neck.
If his average for the first X t is one greater than his average for the X plus two tests   So a hundred and twenty six over X is gonna equal?
What he got in the first
O in the second lot  isn't it?
Plus one.
Mm.
Yes.
So right it down.
Yeah come on!
Just write it down!
Hundred and twen 
What?
What I've just told you hundred and twenty six over X is equal?
Hundred and forty three 
Three 
divide by X plus two
Yeah.
Plus one.
Yes.
Plus one.
Why is it plus one there?
Cos it's says it's This is one more than that isn't it?
This is one more than that.
So shouldn't that be plus one?
How do you make them equal?
Oh yeah.
Yes think about it carefully.
How do you make them equal.
Mm.
That's right so.
Now what are you going to do?
Find the value of X.
I'm an extremely patient soul as you well know,but if you say Find the value of X to me again How are you gonna  find the value of X?
What do you intend to do?
Get rid of the denominators.
Get rid of the denominators, good.
Well done.
Go on then.
Is that right?
No.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
Timesing it by X.
Alright then times it by X.
Go on then if that's what you're doing go on.
Keep going!
Hold on a minute you've still got a this on the bottom haven't you?
To start with come on.
Cos your multiplying by X go on you haven't cancelled it yet go on.
Carry on.
Eh?
What are you doing?
You can't do that!
Why?
Multiply everything by X go on.
Ju just do every term you've got multiply it by X.
Go on.
I don't know how to do it though.
Course you do!
Just carry on multiplying things by X instead of trying to jump to conclusions.
Where's the two X come from?
Times it by 
But you've got that over th on the bottom haven't you?
It's X plus two there, isn't it?
It's got nothing to do when multiplying You're multiplying the top by X go on.
That's better.
That's right perfect.
Go on then, get some stuff cancelled out.
That's right.
No.
There's no way you can do that.
But I've got an X on the top.
Aye but you've got an X plus two on the bottom.
So if I put X minus two on the top?
No it will not cancel.
Why not?
You've got a hundred and forty three X over X plus two, haven't you?
Hundred and forty three minus two.
Hundred and forty does not work.
There's no way that works at all.
Just do what you've got there.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
That's right, equals.
Hundred and forty three X over  X plus two.
That's right.
Plus X.
That's perfect now what are you going to do?
Can I move across That across to this side?
You can multiply everything through by X plus two, yes.
Go on.
Bracket, X plus two never mind about this s Mm.
Equals  that plus  Come on you're multiplying by X plus two.
No  you're multiplying by X plus two.
You've missed a You've now dropped a plus sign out haven't you?
And you've dropped an X out.
Why?
You're multiplying this term by X plus two aren't you?
You're 
Mm.
gonna multiply everything by X plus X plus two.
It just so happens that if multiply this term by X plus two you get rid of the X plus two at the bottom don't you?
Mm.
But everything there It's the same thing as when you were doing this.
The simultaneous equations wasn't it?
Why was it?
You had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out, haven't you?
Yeah.
So here you've got to multiply every term out.
Do not forget that that is a term on its own it's got n connected to this yet.
No.
You're a very very careful about that so start getting it tidied up then.
Expand the brackets I think is probably the best thing.
Hundred and twenty six X 
S X that's right.
Plus two hundred and fifty two.
Equals
Hundred and forty three X 
X 
Plus
X squared  
X squared plus two X.
That's right.
Right now things are getting a bit better aren't they?
Come on!
What're you gonna do now?
Do all the Xs on one side.
Well I'd collect the things together that were the same for a start I think.
What d'you mean?
Well you've got some Xs to collect together haven't you?
Oh.
Mm?
That's better.
That's simplified it.
Yeah.
Now s You can start you've still gotta get the every I would get everything over to one side of the equals sign.
Why?
What's this ?
Then use your quadratic  .
This is a quadratic isn't it?
Yes good.
Does it matter which way you put it?
Well I always like to read it from left to right but it doesn't matter really.
Yeah but I mean
you can do that if you want to.
I would have put all the  the er
Hundred and forty five X minus hundred and twenty six X .
Yes.
Plus x squared  minus two five two 
Minus two five two.
Equals nothing.
Yes.
So that's going to be 
Don't look at me like that!
Nineteen X.
Mhm.
Plus X squared.
Yeah.
Minus two five two .
minus two five two Equals nothing .
Equals nothing that's right.
Now if you're gonna do this you really want it in the form of X squared first don't you?really to make it To make  the thing easy to work, aren't you?
Well that's gonna be your A.
Yeah it is.
B and that's gonna be C .
It's much be It's much better to see it as A square As X squared plus te nineteen X plus minus two two five, really.
Two five two equals nothing.
Right.
Formula.
I don't know.
You're gonna have some tremendously large numbers if you work the formula aren't you?
Yes.
I mean B squared's nineteen squares you know just under four hundred isn't it?
That's twenty times twenty.
You imagine four times that.
A lot.
It's a lot isn't it?
But they're only numbers.
that's true.
But perhaps it's easier I wonder what are other factors of two hundred and fifty two?
One.
One and two hundred and fifty two, yes very good yes.
Two.
Yes good.
We want a difference of nineteen somewhere don't we?
That's easy.
We drop the calculator everywhere.
Well you can drop the calculator if you want it would be better if you pick 'em up and stick the  numbers in.
How're you gonna do?
Two hundred and fifty two divide by nineteen.
What you got?
Thirteen point two six three one five 
Yes.
seven nine eight.
Yes.
I don't think that's right.
Try the square root of two five two.
Fifteen point eight seven four five  
Yes yes ,a difference.
Don't know  does sixteen go into it just try sixteen into two five two.
Fifteen point seven five.
So we want something like erm  Seven and sixteen, well that doesn't work Sorry seven and twenty six.
Is that right?
No.
How about
No, gives a difference of nineteen.
Use the formula then, we're just sitting here wasting time.
Minus nineteen  or minus B plus or minus the square root of B 
Minus B 
Plus or minus
plus or minus the square root of

All over
Two A.
Two A is right.
So what's A?
It's an X!
Must be true.
Yes.
I am delighted you agree.
Yeah.
Minus nineteen
Yes.
plus or minus
The square root of nineteen squared minus four times

Lovely.
All over 
Over two
Two times one.
Yep.
X squared.
X equals not X squared.
Minus nineteen  plus or minus 
plus or minus Can I do that 
Root 
all in one?
Yeah!
I can do it on here, oops!
Hope so.
Square root of nineteen squared minus four times times minus 
Minus 
two five two.
Answer.
Nineteen squared's three hundred and ninety ninety one I think.
Mm.
Three hundred and sixty one.
Really?
Three sixty one times  eight thousand There's summat wrong.
Nineteen squared minus four times one 
No it's minus It's plus It's nineteen squared plus eight  nought  one nought nought eight.
Mm.
Four time two five two.
Two hundred and fifty times four is a thousand Two hundred and fift 
It's minus!
It's minus times a minus  Isn't it?
Four
four times two th two five two is one thousand and eight isn't it?
Yes.
Two fifty times four is a thousand.
So two five two times four is t one thousand and eight, plus three hundred and chunkety chunk Three hundred and sixty one.
Mm.
Which is one three six nine.
That's more like it.
Yeah but what about mm.
above answer.
Mm.
What about that?
Where do  get that from?
Because what you did was you did er nineteen squared
Yes.
minus four.
I don't know why I don't how that works 
Would that be in brackets?
Of course it is.
I didn't put a brackets there.
Well you would have to although I would have though it might have worked algebraically that's certainly wrong though.
What did we say?
One three six  nine .
Nine.
One three six nine, yes.
All over 
Er you want the square root of that.
that's it all over two.
Two.
Yep, so it's minus nineteen plus or minus 
Plus or minus 
root one three six nine.
Square root 
One three six nine.
That's interesting.
Ah!
Yes go on.
Yeah it is isn't it?
Yes.
Go on then.
You'll remember that.
I will.
Thirty seven.
So the f One answer is f fourteen 
Don't!
Just don't!
It's not actually.
One answer's nine innit?
Minus nought point five?
Yeah.
And the other answer is?
Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five, how you managed to produce  that?
Don't know.
Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator  must be about eighteen mustn't it?
Mm.
The difference between thirty seven and nineteen's about eighteen innit?
Approximately?
Divide that by two, answer?
Nine.
Nine.
Mm.
Engage brain  Th You must regard a calculator 
with the greatest and gravest of suspicion.
Cos it's not actually working algebraic that calculator at the present moment I don't know what you've got it programmed in What you've got it at but it's not working algebraic.
Now it might work.
No unless we have to Minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight?
Yeah that's better.
I wonder if  minus.
Wait you've got minus fifty six haven't you here? this is minus fifty six if you use your brain.
And divided by two is minus twenty eight.
Yeah.
Yes minus twenty eight.
Now if you You take the difference between nineteen and thirty seven you get the answer eighteen don't you?
Yes.
You divide that by two you get the answer nine .
Nine.
Mm.
But why isn't my calculator working?
Because you haven't got it in the correct mode it's not working algebraic.
Which is in what function?
Who knows what your calculator and that's a such a wonderful piece of work that.
Yeah but  
Scie Scientific or You want it in scientific mode if it says scientific
Yeah it does.
In that case use it in scientific and then it will work that way.
Will it?
Yeah well it should do.
Anyway.
.
Okay.
Let's read the second part of this question cos it's taken us er quite some time to do it but excellent question.
Hasn't it 
Right 
Right let's read the second part of this.
It has an average of thirteen point five marks for the first X plus one tests.
His mark on the last test gave him a final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
What was his marks for the last test.
How do you work out his total marks for his X plus one tests.
Thirteen point five divided by X plus one.
That's his No no you've got his average as thirteen point five haven't you?
How do you work out his total marks which is what we're really looking for?
Times X plus
Yes, it's thirteen point five times X plus one.
And how do you work out his total marks for his X plus two tests?
Fourteen times thirteen plus two.
No no no.
Why?
Fourteen times what?
Times X plus  two.
Yeah.
That's what I said!
Was it?
I'm sorry I misheard you.
So what it's alright.
Mm.
I misheard you okay?
Mm.
So, it might be a good idea to write that down and work it out.
Thirteen point five
Yes
times
Will you stop doing that!
What?
That!
What's wrong with it?
How do you write a multiplication in algebra?
You're gonna multiply that by X plus one aren't you?
Mm.
How do you write that?
Hundred and thirty five X plus one.
Bracket.
X plus one.
X plus one.
Ha?
Suppose so.
That's how you write it.
Minus fourteen
Never mind about this silliness, that 
you've been allowed to get away with.
Right go and work them out then.
Thirteen point five times one is?
Thirteen point five innit?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Okay.
So what's your total marks?
Sorry what's the difference?
Fourteen point five.
You know what he total mark for  his X plus one test was don't you?
Mm.
And you know the total mark was X plus two tests.
It actually asks you for the mark he obtained for his final tests doesn't it?
Yeah.
So if you take two away, one from the other, you'll have the mark
Nought point five.
for his test won't you?
So you'll have nought point five X plus?
Plus 
Point about it is y you can't see it, can you unless you've got it written down so write it down.
it's thirteen well it's fourteen X isn't it?
Mm.
Plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Or minus thirteen X plus thirteen point five isn't it?
Why is it?
Well you're taking the difference between the two aren't you?
So don't you just minus them?
Yeah.
So that's fourteen X plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Yes?
Mm.
So that's nought point five X, now what?
Plus 
Plus what's the difference here?
Hundred and thir Hundred 
What's twenty eight minus thirteen point five?
Oh it's point five!
Yes.
What's twenty eight minus thirteen poin 
Fourteen point five.
Fourteen point five.
Okay.
So wouldn't 
That's 
you times it by two?
Another student has his average as thirteen point five marks for the first blah blah blah, right.
Which marks for the last test give a final average of fourteen marks for   So the one test is gonna give him that isn't it?
That's right you agree isn't it?
That's his total marks for X plus one tests, is there.
Total marks for S plus plus two tests is there.
The actual mark  is that.
That's for his nought  nought point five X.
So to get those two up to one X  
up to one X you should times by two which is twenty nine.
Which I don't believe.
Well do you times it by four?
No give   but his mark on his last test gave him the final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
So that's his total there and his total there.
Yes it's gonna be doubled hasn't it to give you that?
Oh!
Oh dear!
How daft can you get?
What's the value of X?
W we worked that out somewhere didn't we?
We did didn't we?
Oh!
Oh!
Nearly as bad as .
Dear oh dear!
Eh?
Oh.
Innit?
I'm very tired .
So what do you do?
Times thirteen point five X by
Well you do thirteen point five times ten if you want.
Yes.
And fourteen times eleven.
Why eleven?
Well nine plus two is eleven isn't it?
Yes.
Hundred and fifty four.
Now who is being dormant?
And you've got it haven't you?
Then you find the difference?
Yes.
That makes sense.
actually work here hasn't it?
Does that give you the same answer?
Yes it should do.
Let's just check it go on.
You had thirteen point five times ten which I think is a hundred and thirty five in normal circumstances.
Yes.
And a hundred and f fourteen times eleven.
Go on it's a hundred and fifty four.
Minus nineteen.
No minus a hundred and thirty five.
One fifty four minus hundred and thirty five.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
Which is wh what we would have done if we'd done 
If we'd done 
that better.
Yeah but it we it's a spurious argument because you've got nought point five X haven't you?
Yeah.
Nought point five X i Nought point five of X i is four point five isn't it/
Yeah.
Four point five plus fourteen point five  Answer?
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
We actually got it right both ways.
But it would have been simpler to have done it that way I think.
And quicker.
And quicker.
But not as entertaining.
Yes.
Not as entertaining.
Mm.
If you like.
Yes.
They have a tendency to ask questions not quite as comp Not quite as  abstract as that.
Intricate.
Not even intric Not quite as abstract cos th the the tendency is to ask the question The average weight of nine people is whatever it is, you know somebody else has added 
Yeah  questions.
Yeah yeah.
Rather than quite as abstract as that But you can cope with abstract as that you can do A level.
Yeah.
You have to cope 
You have to  You have to be as abstract as that.
Which will not do you any harm.
Good.
A man bought three box of Dutch cigars.
Good lord how appalling in this day and age!
Three boxes!
At X pence per box, and two boxes of Havana cigars  at Y pence per box.
Calculate terms of X and Y 
Cost of the five boxes.
So what's the cost of the Dutch ones?
How many boxes?
Three X.
Splendid.
What's the cost of the Havanas?
Two Y.
So what's the total cost?
Five X two Y.
Eh?
Five X plus two Y.
Five X plus two Y not just five x two Y.
Plus two Y.
Five X plus two Y.
Wonderful.
Go on 
the average  cost per box in terms of X and Y.
So what's the average b cost per box gonna be?five X plus two Y you better write that down before our brains refuse to accept any more information.
Two Y is the total cost, how do you find the average?
How do you find an average?
Add them together and divide by the number you've got.
How many have you got.
Five.
No you haven't.
We've got five boxes.
No you haven't got five boxes.
Why?
Read it again.
Three boxes of Dutch 
Whoops!
That's supposed to be three X .
That's a three.
Yes that's better.
So you haven't got 
.
F Divide that by five.
Divide that by five.
Yes.
The whole of it?
Yeah.
Cos that's the total price isn't?
Total cost.
Total of boxes you mean.
Total cost.
Five's the total number of boxes but that the top one's the total cost isn't it?
Yea.
That's right.
Yep.
Yes.
Oh..
At a profit of thirty three percent of their costs .
How do 
Thir 
work that out?
Thirty three and a third percent is a third.
Yes.
So I want a third of their  their costs.
So what did he sell  the Dutch box 
Which is the Dutch which is that half.
Well,later he sold his three boxes of Dutch cigars at a profit of thirty three of their cost.
Mm?
So 
So that's three X divided by
No it's not three X divided by five, it's says of their cost.
Thy cost three X didn't they?
Yes.
And the sold them for a third profit so what did he sell them for?
X plus a third.
If he sold the things for 
Four 
thirt Aye.
Four thirds.
No.
I if 
If he's got 
he bought them for three quid?
Yes.
Yeah/ Which is highly improbable but he bought them for three pounds
Yes.
In the days when a gold sovereign meant something when you went abroad 
Yes.
And he sold them that was his cost was three pounds.
And he h He sold them at a profit of thirty three and a third percent which is a third.
What did he sell them for?
Four pounds.
Four quid.
So if he 
four X.
No if he cost him three X, what's he gonna sell them for?
Four X.
Yes.
So he sells his Dutch s cigars for four x.
When he only bought them for three X?
That's right.
So he sold them for four X.
Yeah.
Then what did he do with his havanas?
HE gave away the other two boxes as presents.
Strange man.
A strange fellow.
Well no it probably a little bit of sweetener for a business deal later one perhaps?
Mm.
Yes.
I used to get bottles of whisky at Christmas and so forth.
And we stole it .
Yes you now what it m Yes you know all about that?
Yes.
Yes.
So it's a box of h s Havana cigars.
So how much profit did he make on that?
He didn't did he?
He made 
absolutely no profit at all, in fact he made a loss of?
Two X.
Two Y.
Yes two Y.
Yeah.
Calculate the amount he received for the sale of the cigars.

Come in.
Hello.
Hello  what can we 
do for you sir?
It's this shoulder stuffed up again.
Having trouble again?
Aye.
headaches  
Mhm.
you know they're getting worse and worse and worse.
I think it's the .
Wasn't it  or something you gave me?
Yes.
Oh.
That was January.
Oh aye.
Right .
But now it's actually spread you know th the pain seems to be spread all right up here.
?
Aye.
Ah.
Well that's right enough what I thought.
It's been a neural neuralgia right enough.
Mm.
It's when I go to lie down at night you know that's it.
and then the headaches just start.
You know?
When, when you were taking the  was it  better?
No.
No change at all?
No.
No change.
No.
No change at all.
Right.
I don't want to give you anything that's gonna knock you  silly or
Mm.
dopey with it or anything like that.
Mm .
I want to get the right sort of thing for you.
You know I'm going around lightheaded with it y you know and dizzy with it you know?
Yeah.
Tt er 
been reading too much in this Sunday Post.
She's got me this and that and all the rest of it you know?
Mm.
But I don't know what you've got without waiting for any  I 
couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell you.
It's er  
I'm still trying to give up the cigarettes you know?
I got those patches.
So  Mm.
Do these patches seem alright though?
Have you seen ?
Yes.
Aye and they're  
Oh.
Patches are fine.
Are they?
Aye.
There's nothing wrong with them.
It's very difficult to do er two things at the same time.
Mm.
Very difficult if you've got, and you know giving up is fine
Mm.
if you haven't got a broken ankle or a sore, sore 
Mhm.
shoulder or
No.
headaches or, fine.
Mm.
do it.
No.
But when you've got something else  that's hard.
Mm.
That's hard.
Mm.
Even with the patches.
I went onto er you know rolling my cigarettes up myself so I wouldn't be
Mhm.
smoking as much.
I started blaming that for the headaches.
They just seem to come on you know?
Mhm.
Well don't, don't do anything.
Just get rid of one thing before you start 
before you start doing anything else.
Mm .
Here we are now.
That's that.
Actually  travel this  .
Ah.
Yes it'll, it'll travel right down to the tips
Ah.
of your fingers.
Aye.
If you feel that there's
Are you  tonight?
No.
I'm on er I signed off   
Oh right.
too right.
Okay.
Fine.
Mm.
You get started on that and we'll see 
you in about four weeks
Right.
and see how it's doing.
Okay then.
Right.
Okay.
Thank you very much then Doctor .
Okay.
Cheerio then.

Next patient Dr .
Come in, come in.
Morning Doctor.
Good morning.
Now what can I do for this lady?
My daughter's  Doctor.
I didn't really want  had a mastectomy.  another lump there.
Another lump?
It might only be breast tissue, I don't know that.
Mhm.
Let's have a wee look.
And she called him in on Sunday night, I mean I wouldn't have.
No.
Right.
It's hard.
But i it's like where the stitches are you know.
Where where the stitches were, right.
Well, partly where they are.
Right, er 
I just happened to feel it because the wounds haven't been healing Doctor,
Has it not?
using that erm what's the name of the cream?
That steroid cream?
Eumobate 
Aha.
Right.
Well, I've been to see Mr , and then I was off again to see him, and he said I was right.
But he didn't say whether I, I just continued with the cream, but it was the other night  I just felt wee .
Could be a bit of breast tissue, I don't know.
But it is quite a hard lump.
Aye, he was quite happy.
He couldn't feel anything
No he  
to worry about?
Mhm.
That's what he said.
Yes.
Here I felt a lump.
Yes,
In a different 
aye, it's a different bit.
It's higher.
It's up  he didn't  actually examine that part where I think there's a lump.
See after a breast operation does it take a long long time with stitches?
Oh yes.
Oh aye.
Aye cos I tried the prosthesis  and I tried the, but it just catches, and then er .
And it's 
Keeps, keeps rubbing against this, this is 
so sore.
Aye.
That's the worst bit.
That's the worst bit.
But 
In here.
but that's no where the lump is.
Let's have a wee look at this lump and see what 
Stupid, you're into a state, isn't it?
No, not.
Cos
in that bit.
See what's going on here.
Oh right you know what I .
That it?
Oh  
I think that's your rib.
My rib?
I think that's your rib.
No 
Aha, that's right.
Oh yeah.
That my rib?
That feels like a rib.
Oh Jesus.
Is it?
Aye.
That's your other one, that's the one on top, there's the one underneath.
And then there's, the other one's just underneath that, so  there.
Oh it's a rib then.
See that, that's your rib.
Aha.
It's hard?
Aye, oh it's hard.
Very very hard.
Because so was the last lump, hard and then it was  like you know?
That's right.
That's hard, yeah.
Right.
That's, that's, that's 
er the edge of your rib.
I don't think, I don't feel anything else there, Katrina.
Now when are you going back to see Mr ?
I go back 
Right.
I'll drop 
him a wee note, and tell him that you, that you, you know, you can feel this er I'll tell him I've had a look at it, and think it's the rib that's showing through.
I'll see what he says.
I've had a lot of bother with a wee bit of red blisters
Aye up the top.
That's, that's, that's the stitches.
you know  it's a bit of a  and it's really sore like.
And then as the day goes on, I've got to go and tear this off, cos it gets, these bits get red,
Red red raw.
oh really sore Doctor , you cannae
Right.
Then it comes in like a tingling feeling.
Like a, a ne a nettle stinging you you 
Right.
know.
And it's just 
Sounds 
the clothes that are doing that.
Aye, it sounds like the stitches right enough.
And does that take a long time?
I mean 
Yes.
I thought, I didn't think that it takes as long as that.
I mean he did say they were stitches that come out er what 
That there, you get, there are 
some stitches that c 
They stay in but he says that
That's right.
in the body.
But they don't come out with your , you know your bath.
That's right.
They're they're too 
They just integrate in the body .
They're too deep underneath the skin.
Aye, he said that.
The way the way
Cos I heard it takes as long.
That's why they take so long.
there's  now
Just keep on with that cream?
U use this stuff instead of that er Eumobate It's 
Aha.
slightly stronger.
Aha.
And that might do that, I'll drop Mr  a wee note, tell him that you've been in,
Aha.
so that when he sees you the next time, he'll double check that.
Aye.
Aha.
But I don't think there's anything 
Er 
to worry about Katrina.
I hope not.
No.
No.
I just, I just felt that it was the cream the other night, and then I just felt oh, you 
Mhm.
know b what I've been getting on Friday and Saturday night was an awfully big  
Yes.
in my shoulder.
Up, up over the top here.
On the shoulder, more 
Yes, that's right.
I've always been getting a shooting pain there that kind of happened and I just 
That's right.
thought it was the stitches.
That's, aye, it's, it's everything's beginning to get tight.
Tight now, aye.
This is, this is you starting to feel the sore bits.
But er 
I'll, I'll drop him a wee note anyway.
Aye.
Okay.
Right Katrina.
else I feel Doctor I've,
Aye.
got angina, and I've got the like the heart failure.
Mhm.
And I didn't want any breast off, naturally.
No no.
I mean but see the tremendous strain that it's putting on me?
Ah.
You know, I feel that is left, left  angina,because I've got to rip the brassiere off at a certain time of the day  
Aha.
extra weight.
The extra weight,
you know?
I didn't want any  off, I think I'd have .
Right Katrina .
Cheerio.
Right, okay, cheerio now.

Doctor , do you want to see Thomas  again?
There is, they're all  
Mm.
of .
Erm
Thomas.
Thomas .
Some of them er
Oh, yes.
Right.
there's a few times so I'll give you that four.
Is that?
D do you want to see him again?
Aye.
That's fine.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.

shortage was twenty five K Gs of .
You hadn't got the bags printed, the bags being printed today and Tony will make it today.
Currently Alan  is having extreme difficulty in getting hold of any dried blood.
Apparently we're not killing as many cows as we used to.
So there's a tremendous shortage, he's trying Germany, he's trying all over.
But the consequence is, until he gets it, we can't make any fish, blood and bone.
And that applies to twenty fives and obviously pre-packs.
Er  before I went off, we were talking about  packaging, have we decided to bring any in yet?
There's another few weeks have drifted and sooner or later we'll have to start making .
Yeah Alan and I are gonna go through the details  .
I've got a I've got a lot of things to talk about so 
you know before we do .
The next thing I'm not very happy about the supply of printed bags coming in from er the workshop.
Talking to Eric yesterday, how many should she be able to do an hour, five hundred erm approximately.
I said to Celia how many she thinks she can do a day, she thinks about two thousand, depending on what she's doing.
And when she worked here, she had her daughter working with her and they were a team and they went like a bomb.
Up there she's got no disrespect, somebody who's not quite as bright as they might be er and she's not working overtime as they would do here if they got behind, they're working half eight to half four is it Ray?
Yeah.
And in consequence you know, there's an accumulation.
Erm  Simon had a list Well we'd come and see him the thirty first of January, Tony came to me to work on it today, and that's not .
All I'm saying is at the moment, she can't apparently cope with the demand on her for bags.
According to Tony  we're going out of at the end of the month.
Well s well erm Pete said originally, at the end of the month but it looks like, with this problem, it's gonna be phasi If we can get some off-site at the end of the month.
It doesn't matter though does it if we overflow?
No because all we have to do is switch it on switch it off like that.
We don't give them any notice at all.
But I do believe that we should seriously look at getting say, internal usage bags for nutrients er bags for lime, anything that we have printed, we ought to look at the  and say to Mike or get 'em printed or something.
Okay.
Alright.
Lynne at a meeting yesterday, Tom  said to ask you please, no more  to be ordered.
That is  Ian, I'll give Ian a ring cos Ian r rings direct.
Okay.
Erm  Ray can you arrange please to send one hundred thousand J E B  bags up to?
Okay.
A complaint from George er  in the pre-packs this morning, reference er  going through the U V A. Apparently, I don't understand this but he says it's wearing out erm belts at a cost of a hundred and forty a pair every fortnight.
And last night he was out back here at work at nine o'clock.
And as a result of this, through the night, er Angela working in U V A produced two hundred and ninety seven.
Eig the three K G line when the machine and everything was running properly, you'd be getting six eighty.
Er I mean obviously  be due to 
Right in the back.
Angela's er lack of experience yeah .
George  inexperience.
And he says it's I think he was gonna talk to you about it .
Yeah yeah.
he has done this morning, and he's talked to us about the film.
I think 
Yeah.
the machine side of it.
Yeah yeah.
We know there's a problem and we've all gone back in and .
Er Tom  has also asked for twenty tonne of anutrients to go up to.
Er  this week's production sheet er and I wonder of Ian could bear in mind that he should try and keep an extra ten tonne when he's looking at his reserves here just in case 
and we don't get stuck in the middle of an export  .
He'd already he'd seen the bags going up and he'd already got that in his head.
But  you see he knows he's gotta keep something back.
If he can
Yeah.
keep up a reserve here so that 
Yeah  
send them five or ten tonne.
Yeah.
Er one thing Stewart, erm any word for from John  about the state of the ?
No no .
Right, on the  thing, just finally, there's a hundred and thirty thousand  growbags here  next week.
And currently we've got a hundred and thirty four thousand cos we've got four days production  to build up the surplus.
But we've got eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty .
My count at the moment, I reckon we've got scattered round the countryside, ten thousand.
Which would cover us for Friday and Monday's loadings.
Phil  said if you wish he'll  his men on Saturday and Sunday.
Right well  don't have any papers on those but I thought we'd got more than that.
I thought we'd got I thought we could satisfy .
Friday, Monday and Tuesday.
Well, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, you're talking about nearly twelve thousand.
We're almost there  
Yes.
But that's wh that's your position at the moment isn't it?
That's how I take it.
We've got that on the computer, that came in  yesterday, that came in  wherever
Yeah.
and that came in  this morning.
Yeah.
That's the total we've got in at the moment.
We've got one thousand eight hundred and ninety at  and Eric checked and we've got nine hundred at the other place.
And they did another h eleven hundred and forty yesterday didn't they?
Well that's what he says they've got in stock at the moment.
Perhaps they've got more in transit Eric do you think?
Lorries on the road.
I don't know I don't know mate.
No.
I don't know.
I've got  a bit on that, if you want I could bring it up now while you're talking about it, I will.
Okay.
Pete while you're talking about  I've got I've I've got a quickie to bring up on that.
I've been on to this morning,asked me to and they have got thirty palettes there at the moment.
And they and they're working away.
What they say is they're getting no liaison at all when there's any lorries going in to pick any product up.
It would be lovely he said if somebody could give him a ring .
No  Let me just tell what is actually happening.
who are the main people
Yes.
Actually had a program of what is going through.
Yes.
So does Tim .
Yes.
I think it's a lack of communication  
Ah so it's their end, not our end.
yeah.
They have got a program of what's being pulled out as far as the trucks are concerned.
Yeah.
Dick got one, 's have got one.
The people at  have got one.
Everybody's got the schedule of what they pull out so .
Yesterday what actually happened was Yeah hang on a minute 
So it's only the poor bloke on-site who doesn't know?
What happened yesterday was, they had a breakdown again.
Yeah.
Right.
And they had three wagons turn up.
Yes.
And they couldn't load three wagons.
Yes.
They loaded I think one and two thirds.
Yeah.
And they had to send one wagon, because they couldn't load it, over to  to pick up some more  
Yes I see.
It's more  
So it it's yon end .
I think it's just Tim and and the other guy,
Okay.
cos he he does do a hundred and one jobs.
He's on .
Okay.
The breakdown was only for an hour and a half  the lorries turned up and the breakdown was happening .
But the information is there, just that 
said I've got a guy that's been stood here for an hour, don't know what to do with him..
What was this production here last night?
Yeah cos it was  
They didn't do anything really did they .
What happened was the the stuff didn't come in till quarter past four, the dust extraction didn't get done till after five, so we said, Right, from six this morning till they finish it, give me bags per hour and the run.
I've just timed
Hello.
Er instantaneous timing per bag fifteen seconds so that's about you know, it's two hundred odd an hour .
Do you want to .
Just a sec, hang on.
.
And I know they got to palletize them, wrap 'em and shift 'em and everything but er as our lot  more than .
Mm.
You know if they did .
But it's Brian I would like to see.
The calculation  it's not just the bagging, it's the bagging and the stacking .
Well what I'm saying though Ray is really everything downstream of 
the baggers should be able to cope shouldn't it.
You can get it through the sealers quickly and under the flattener.
Providing you can get it palletized and it's chucking men at it.
I wanna go out I'll go out there with Bryn and Eric anyway as soon as we've finished cos it wants .
As soon as it's finished I'll ring Joseph and get one .
Well ring him now then, see if he's got any .
The and then we'll let him know when .
There's always er Mr  if you want to drag him .
Well I could take him off line.
No.
Where is he?
I mean John.
Oh.
Oh.
I says to him I says, we're flexible here, you might find .
Erm the only other thing is, we've still got a spare man out on the  haven't we, covering the breaks.
We take him off and don't cover the breaks while you want him.
Right?
Well let's we'll go and have a look.
Yeah.
Me and Bryn and Eric .
.
There's not really much .
We had a breakdown  yesterday it was an hour and a half.
Apparently it was caused by dust getting in.
Dust got into one of the circuit breakers on the machine and apparently shorted it out.
electrician in .
Yeah that that was solved very quickly.
The problem with the truck you know about now.
The plan is today to i is still three loads, and we've got three loads planned for the rest of this week.
If they are double shifting it'll be on Monday.
Just whilst 
They've got through eleven hours today have they?
Yes that that  
We've definitely gone to eleven hours ?
Yes that's what he told me, he said we were going on to for the rest of the week, eleven hours and then start double shifting Monday.
Who's responsible for shipping it from  and  into here.
Who's the trigger, what's the trigger?
To bring it in.
Cos it doesn't It's not gonna  
I don't like the way you're looking at me.
We're the trigger we've got to try and schedule three pickups three baggings a day .
Three pickups a day.
Three a day.
Based on we can do they were doing sixty five palette loads a day.
three trucks would equate to sixty six approximately.
And is that to Phil to get his lot over is it?
I've asked Phil to bring his as he produces it, bring it over.
There's one in this morning I saw.
Has he.
Yeah.
Well it's just a question of him arranging the transport to get rid of it.
It's best if he arranges the transport cos he knows what's there.
Yeah.
Well I'll tell Phil then and no Saturdays but also get it  on a daily basis.
What's erm what are we gonna work here assuming this goes?
If it goes we're gonna bring the lads that finish at  lines three and four so it'll be what six six till, whenever you want, ten hours?
Twelve hours?
Well that'll be from Monday Lynne won't it?
From Monday yeah.
Yeah.
If you want  
I think that's alright for Monday.
Er no cos we're what we're gonna use the product that we've got in and you need some  don't you?
Definitely.
So what we're gonna do was do what Peter wanted and have from Monday, if you do want us to do it.
Cos again no decision, it's just yes we can do it.
We're just running out the material that we've got here.
I dunno Steve said yesterday he thought it was cheaper at .
They seem to be able to cope with it far better than anybody in this group at the moment don't they.
They're producing more than  
or well
It's not a sort of a long term thing.
I mean what's the position with ?
Well you've got the contract  finite number of bags.
I think if we went in again and tried to do another  .
They want the work I'll tell you that.
They want the work.
They want the work.
They're keen to do it a and if you want to make any more  it can be done but I think  
They was hoping  three months work then.
Yeah I don't think they're doing a great er I don't think they're making a great deal of money out of it themselves.
They're not.
Well he keeps  telling me that  he keeps saying .
.
Well can we not buy it  see where stocks lie.
Do we have to make a decision.
Now?
Well you've only got actually you've got 
Well no only that 
You've got five thousand bags here anyway.
The rest are out at  and  and you've got one load at   run that load through.
Oh yeah it makes sense to run that load through but whether What I'm saying is whether we go on next week to a continuous .
Well I think you have a look at what they're doing, the only thing is if if we say they need another bloke, if you're gonna do that next week, then you've gotta plan for that before next week .
That's the main problem What it is I'm ho we're holding fire 
the temps.
The temps  we're holding fire on them to know what to do with it.
If you want them on a coach , they'll be I think there's six up there is there?
Six  
Six so that means five five on a shift down here, we'll find something to do with them.
If not we're gonna double the shift back with the mixers.
We don't want to lose the men so we've got them here.
Yeah.
And we're saying, Yes you've got next week but we don't know where you are.
.
Yeah, that's why they're here and really I would like to know by  Friday m tennish.
Let's make a decision on Friday management meeting.
depending on what we've got out of by then.
What  's done .
Yeah.
What the breakdown situation is .
We need to look at  Bryn and Eric and just  tidy up the bits but see what they get off this then.
Yeah.
Today.
Yeah.
Get an idea of what  
Well let's leave that let's leave  
Yeah.
to Friday morning then.
So Friday  
So just flogging it to death
Yeah.
at the minute, we're waiting for some bits for this  should be in today.
Yeah yeah 
Yeah but we're that that would enable a double shift to be done  decide not to run a double shift  
Only because it would have meant stopping the pre-pack.
No it doesn't no no no that's what we've been
Prior to getting the  
Yeah yeah.
But that was why as I understood it, that was why I wanted the sealer.
Yeah.
Well Arthur wants the sealer anyway because if you're not doing  over there, you'll have double shift working on pre-packs.
So it still wants
I still want to get it going but I don't want to put a double shift onto  unless I have to.
.
pre-packs.
Mm.
The message I got was that  the last few days  it didn't matter a bugger what it cost but we were in desperate straights to get in stock.
What we're saying now really, that's not quite.
Well I'm saying I still don't know, the figures that I'm being given suggest that by Friday, erm or by Monday, we'll have sufficient  to meet the orders of .
The fifteen .
It's on there Steve, and the amount that  
The eighteen the allocation is eighteen thousand.
By Friday night we'll have sixteen thousand of those right.
Now that's the worst scenario given that you get five hundred a day out of 
Yeah.
and you get fourteen hundred a day out of.
Mm.
Now that would be the worst scenario .
they should do two thousand plus.
Then then okay, two thousand plus.
And then you've got however many you're gonna get off the line here between now and
Well you're gonna get whatever 
And  did seven hundred in el in eleven hours on Monday.
So they've upped slightly.
Seven hundred.
But they did four hundred last night  breakdown.
But we know  are going on to double shift on Monday
Yes it's eleven hours this week.
The problem is .
They should do
You'll get two thousand on Monday.
Yes.
and that's without going onto a double shift 
That's right.
at .
That's right.
That's why I'm saying let's wait while
I think so.
Friday and make a decision on Friday without panicking into a decision .
If things change in the meantime we could always
We could always ch we could always
Well we've got the o we've got the
You've got the option.
the people
Yeah.
and we've got the people here.
Why look for spending extra money when you don't need to?
Alright let's review at  but let's make a decision on Friday about what we do on the shift pattern on Monday.
Okay just before we go off Peter's erm the first comment you made Peter was about ten K Gs of 
Yes.
the computer says there was some and there isn't any .
Yes.
I think this is erm it it's an extremely worrying fact as far as I'm concerned, I got a phone call from Chris  just before this meeting.
He wants er to to get together with Ian and myself Ian  and myself straight after this meeting.
Because he's saying that the January stock take is quite is al is impossible to reconcile.
Bloody Hell.
He says he just can't backtrack.
He says there's so many differences .
Quite honestly Steve .
It's very difficult at this moment to say we're not talking about finished stock you know, you're gonna get fluctuations on product, but what worries me, I don't know at this stage how many tonnes of bone meal we've got stashed away somewhere or how many tonnes of  compost maker we've got stacked anywhere for use in the pre-pack.
Because that information is not in the computer at the moment.
Can I just  I think it's fairly important  that if we'd have actually done the reconciliation, last week, we'd have had the opportunity to recheck them.
Which wasn't possible because Chris was saying it wasn't possible to do.
We might not be in this situation now.
But I thought that er with  coming off that, Malcolm was going on to that.
Malcolm was doing part of it.
Sorry I'm not laying any criticism anywhere  
I know you're not Steve but all I'm saying is that we had a discussion about this earlier in the week.
Chris refuses to do something I'm afraid when somebody's already done three quarters of the work, you can't put somebody on to do the last quarter.
Mm.
And Chris was already inputting all of the data.
And when he was offered help he said, No, I will do it myself.
And we've been waiting and waiting and waiting now for a week to get this reconciliation at least together so that we could go out and re-count whatever was required.
Eric and myself went out and did a physical re-count last week of wha a whole bay of  because numbers weren't adding up.
Mm.
We went and did that ourselves  it needed that concerted effort.
And I'm not being funny but when Malcolm did it, we would do that almost two or three days after the stock taking if there were odd counts.
That's the question I asked this morning, Why wasn't it you know, why weren't we doing it?
And I think I think the reconciliation  what he's actually saying is he hasn't got time to recheck those reconciliations before this weekend's deadline  that's what it appears to be .
And that's that's not good enough.
No it's not, agreed.
And and Chris has just put his head in his hands and said I can't do it.
Mm.
It's not a matter of they're not reconcilable, I think there has to be a strong point that's made.
And I think Peter's been saying this for almost well since he's come back anyway that, I can't work because the stock figures have not been updated.
Monday's production's not in.
Tuesday's production's not in.
And I said to Chris, you know, I said to Chris yesterday, Are you putting in the production or have you put I can't do two jobs at once, I can't do two jobs at once and that was it.
So at five o'clock last night when I called down,I didn't respond.
I just ignored it.
At five o'clock I said to Chris I said, How about if I ask Cindy if she can help.
It's bugger all to do with me but my interest is getting the  in.
No!
No!
Now Cindy's saying to me, I can put it in.
Mm.
So if you if you're having words with Chris if you can say
Well I am.
If you you know
Well I think we we should  reaction was happening with Malcolm last week.
How Malcolm was asking how he could help
And you can't unfortunately take it away on block like I said, and give it to someone and say, finish it off.
and the other is, why should I clear up the mess that this guy's made.
Yeah.
I don't think it was a lousy stock take.
I think the the count etcetera went alright.
I think it's the reconciliation based on perhaps some of the problems that we had at the lost last stock take which are accelerated  You know probably the odd miscount here and there this time.
Mm.
I mean I looked through it this time.
Mm.
I mean I looked through it yesterday and th there are a few reconciliations which wouldn't take much sorting out.
Small ones.
There appear to be a lot jotted throughout, but they don't amount to a vast amount of money.
I d I don't know the problems at the moment.
I think it's worth looking at.
Yeah.
First actually.
Yeah perhaps that's yeah alright I'll retract that.
I don't know whether it was a lousy stock take or not.
The  the reconciliations  suggesting that it wasn't a good stock take.
Yeah.
When I was speaking t very very briefly erm to Ian before before I came down he said, well I'm really not surprised, the the the continuing problem and difficulty in establishing what's on the palette, as to whether it's lawn feed and weed, lawn feed and , for example.
And erm
Why should that be.
I think prob problems of identification haven't really been right this time and we made a point a clear point this time with a note to people, if they weren't sure, to make comments on the books.
I think if you look through the books, there are comments in there where they weren't sure, with question marks and they were to be rechecked.
The problem is it's not got to that stage yet.
Yeah.
I mean th that is that's crazy.
Absolutely yeah, I mean I and I I'll reiterate it and I'm not siding with Malcolm but two days after the stock taking they did prior to this one, we were out there rechecking.
Mm.
out rechecking  with Malcolm in cahoots to say, well show me where you counted these and let's do it again.
Yeah.
That's not happened, there's been absolutely zero coordination either  on a daily basis  here.
But Malcolm  Chris, have you got the numbers yet, have you got them crunched?
Oh well, I'll got to enter another few .
I I feel a bit sorry for for some of the counters because they can see certain on one palette for instance, I found there were three sorts of bags.
Just on one palette.
And if you didn't have the expertise to know Ah well I know what's in there, then what the hell does that person count  they've got to go and chase somebody to to find out
These were from erm from .
There was there was ten ten ten  bags, there was eleven five five ,
Ah right.
there was Spring and Summer and you thought well, what's what like you know we 
But as Ray said, all they got to do is query it haven't they.
Yeah but everything was queried You look at 
Oh the Yeah.
books and they were all queried.
I'm partly agreed with you the fact that the stock take at the end of the day we got it right, but all I'm saying it was very difficult
Difficult to count yeah.
And we could make it better by making sure that the bags came in more correct like what Simon's doing now with those printed labels.
Every bags gonna have a printed label on.
So 
Steve you were here on the day.
Mm.
We were supposed to start at six o'clock.
I mean some of us were in at six.
No no no it wasn't supposed to start at six, it was supposed to start at seven thirty.
No Chris should have been in at six, that's when the first team started counting.
Most of the teams that we'd organized that we sent notes round to start at seven thirty.
Yeah.
When you got in there at seven thirty, Chris wasn't there and the books weren't there and people were waiting around ready to get off.
It it wasn't organized well from that point of view.
I I'd asked Chris to organize it and it wasn't.
Okay.
I think the fact that the books were filled out correctly and I think you should give the people that did the stock take, congratulations because the books were filled out reasonably well considering some of their ex inexperience in it.
I think they did a good job on the day and they stayed until the counts were done.
In fact I do believe one team was here till about two thirty doing it
Yeah.
I know Chris was here doing doing his own calculations on  books but after that I mean the I think on the Sunday I he came in and did some work .
And then the stock stock take was dropped then for four or five days.
And we got Malcolm in to enter some of the input, we got Joe to enter some of the input.
But the final reconciliation has taken so long.
Mm.
Even after I mean, as I say, we went out on the Wednesday  and he said, all I need is for you to do this book again for me.
for God's sake.
I mean we did that on the Wednesday, and he said that's all I need now.
Monday it was.
And it's now
Straight after .
Middle of the following week and we got the first reconciliation yesterday.
Okay.
I I don't have anything further to bring up, there are no packaging issues .
.
Yeah erm just to clarify one thing, chutes and blockage up in chutes and s when the screen blocks up.
Who's job is it to dig it out or clean it out?
That's what I'd like to know cos there's a lot of confusion going on out there.
In terms of what Ray .
Well a lot of people out there think it's a fitter's job to clean chutes out and unblock screens.
I in my personal opinion I I don't think it is.
.
If you need tools to do it, then a fitter initially and then if the help comes from the people that are stuck because it's not working anyway, to help clean out.
Mm.
Well there's a prime example at the moment down the sedge hopper.
Which we call the sedge hopper on the  line.
Now I've looked at that this morning, we are getting spillage because the chute is that blocked up, there's that much polythene round the flail which we had a fire on before, down there and the stuff is piled right up, you can't even see the bottom tail drum.
And the conveyor that takes the stuff away.
Now you know, it's alright, we can't stop spillage, we never will stop spillage.
But I think we with the wet stuff we've had going through, the chute is blocking up.
And not getting cleaned out.
Pete got some cleaning up done last Saturday which is you know, round the er  screen, that area's all been cleaned up but obviously he ain't got enough blokes to to get the lot done.
clean them.
Well apparently so yeah.
Yeah.
.
Yeah, basically it's always been but it hasn't been enforced for quite some time, that the clean up rate is four pounds and hour which equates to six pound an hour on a Saturday.
Yeah, cos it's time and a half ?
Mm.
Now  erm when Paul came in he unfortunately come in and clean up come in and clean up and they were put on their own rate which they should never have been.
right l I'd said to Paul now have you told them it's .
Oh no I haven't.
So they got paid their own rate.
So they've been used to their own rate and I said each time, if you're gonna get  you must tell them it's the cleanup rate.
So probably three months went by where they got their own rate.
So I says to Pete, right, start as we mean to go on, I refuse to pay any more than the cleanup rate.
So he goes out there and they all turn round and say, stuff you, I'm not coming in to clean up for four pound and hour which again equates to six pound an hour.
So we got  Mark  I think was the only erm full timer off the compost plant that agreed to come in.
Mm.
And two or three temps and the rest were a couple of temps from the mixing plant.
Now Pete has said he's not gonna give in.
It's four pound an hour and it stands.
When Dick's lads are down to seven and a half hours which they are in the erm summertime, I mean we s the lads'll come in I mean we can't pull them off now, but those lads'll come in and clean up.
Permanent lads will come in and clean up.
But no they're just being damn awkward I'm sorry.
So Pete said, right, they're not gonna beat me, it's four pound an hour and that's it.
So they turn round and say, I'm not coming in.
But they'll come in if we want  cutting out and cos they get their own rate.
Well if they're going onto eight hour regular they'll probably  they'll probably still change their mind .
You see As I said, they might have just actually cut off their nose to spite their face .
Well they I think Yes I think they
really got to play them at their own game really.
and I'm sorry.
Mm.
It's been hard work for us but we're not giving in in here and that's it .
Oh it is, I mean I  that responsibility.
They they would come in mate if it was on their own rate but as soon as you.
There's a erm if there's a need for 'em to clean this Saturday, say  they need to clean round that sedge 
Well I I think there's a necessary to clean up this 
I I'll try and get a gang 
Well no, what you want to do, ask that same gang that came in last week,
I will.
and bugger the rest.
Yeah.
Ask those same blokes specifically  
I mean, I've had an offer from  who said I'll come in any Saturday but I can't take him off Dick cos Dick needs him there.
But when it comes to the 
you know, when all our temps are gone, then the first people that'll get asked are Dick's lads who've said, yes we'll do it, providing Dick doesn't want us.
I wouldn't I wouldn't give them the option, I would go and ask those same ones you had in last week.
As long as you've got somebody here that can
Underneath the screen up in the pie in the sky I mean that I mean I've known that when you've only got about that much where you should have that.
and it's maybe narrowed down to that.
Which the fitters'll take the side off for 'em,
Yeah.
but to get in to clean it out
What I might actually do it see if Ian's not doing anything if he not come in for the full time that they're cleaning up, but come in for those sort of things.
Well as long as the chutes get cleaned out 
you see that we're getting a lot behind that sleeper wall in between the packing line and the sleeper wall again.
I mean, an incident happened last week er the fitter went up They asked the fitter if they could track the belt up on the top.
So the lad went up and tracked it.
He come back to me he says, it's spilling over the top  because the chutes are blocked up he says I'll tell the track driver, the track driver says, Oh well get the  to clean that up.
I said, like hell you will.
Like hell you will.
I've had bloody platforms put up there to make it a lot easier for people to get up there.
I mean I could understand  when we had to climb up the belt which was damn dangerous, but now we've altered all that.
But they keep thinking I mean I've got like forty days holiday  my staff to get in in fif in fifty days left.
You know it's it's a problem.
Will you will you for Saturday though  do that, see Ian and make sure he knows what wants do what you think wants doing.
And make sure that he isolates the plant.
Ian did come in one Saturday 
for me last year and he and he did  Yeah I will see him 
Yeah we'll see if he'll come in and do something like that again.
Yeah.
You will see him before  
and have a word with him because he he knows what chutes is blocked up and what wants cleaning out.
But as I say, we can take the plates off the screen underneath here but I mean I think you still ought to have another bloke 
Well get together with Ian and sort of 
up there with him to clean it out because I say, you can isolate things but you're up in the air.
Yeah.
And that and that's what
Well as long as he knows what wants doing, as long as they're safe.
Well .
Erm I've been out as on the er line three this morning and I think there's another little bit we ought to buy but we'll discuss that as we're going on eh ?
Mm.
Erm  the U V A machine, the problem we've got on there which Ray's explained or Peter raised this morning, there is in between the the drive belts that take the film down the former and which They've put a new set on which is a hundred and forty pound a pi They're in between the two drive wheels, there is a plastic adjuster.
And what it does really is keep the belt firm so when it goes on the former it keeps it firm .
That is worn.
And one's been on er apparently I didn't know this but George showed me this morning.
Brian  made on and put on.
Well it ain't lasted.
I think it's only lasted about eight or ten weeks.
And it's worn.
So what I'm doing now I've got one of the lads down at er  Plastics
Mm.
Yes they have got some stuff, yes he's gonna get a price to make some on this hard plastic that we've got on the .
Mm.
Erm which I think that's gonna solve one of the problems.
It's gonna be cheaper doing it that way than going through U V A .
U V A yeah.
Erm as I say but but that is on there.
Now the mix-up we had yesterday, er on a lot of aggro when I got  about this dust extract system one line three.
I don't know whether people think they can move a dust extract  in an hour or two hours.
Er we're limited with people and while Brian  was in the verge of moving it which the electrics all had to be took out and rerun, he got called away, down to the pre-packs to a breakdown so obviously it didn't get done, the job stopped cos there's nobody else.
When I come back in, things was all up in the air because while he was moving the first position of the dust extractor, there's a radio there.
And we'd  squared it up once before  because there was wires hanging all over from the sp not from the radio, from the speakers.
And we asked them to tie it up, the lads made a bloody job I think they tied it up for  coming round.
Which they did do, but yesterday when Brian went to move the dust extractor that the radio was at the side of, there was wires hanging again like bloody clothes line again.
So straight away he said, that's it I I'll condemn it.
And that's when he lost cooperation with the workers out there.
They buggered him about apparently.
Went and signed the forklift off and signed the keys out and generally
Well he was moving with the forklift, their forklift and he come back and he says  
Pete was out there and I know a lot of tempers got frayed.
Yeah  
said I walked away.
Yes quite right .
It was it was personalities
Yeah.
more than anything.
And I said to Brian you know he's 
Out there wasn't it yesterday.
you know I did say to Brian
Yeah well at the end of the day I mean I I wasn't there but a the facts at the end of the day were that they'd been buggering about with that radio system which they shouldn't do.
No.
So I said to Brian, right leave it.
I think the best thing there would be to leave it for a week,
Yeah.
let 'em have it back
Yeah.
on condition that they don't do anything silly with it.
That way Brian's had his  they've got their 
It's yeah yeah 
radio back and everything should be status quo.
Yeah.
But they shouldn't do that.
They're not they aren't allowed they aren't qualified to bugger about with  
Well that have actually been told that if anything comes in providing This is what I can't get through We've said to them you can bring your radios in but give to Brian first.
To check.
Let Brian check them 
It's not  the radio though it's not 
They they've put some speakers on it haven't they.
They  bloody speakers all over the place.
I mean the mixer's just as bad but really we've got on to them Brian did and they made a good job, they squared it up.
But I mean I mean we still walk round  there's wires hanging and connectors .
Mm.
Now .
Well it shouldn't be done anyway.
It shouldn't be done  
End of story as far as I'm concerned.
But I think I think it was the way maybe the way Brian approached them you know, I think there's a little bit on both sides 
But it was a bit of Yeah.
To come back in and get  bloody aggro like that and it's you know and it
Brian'd be under stress anyway having to move that er dust extractor quickly and he's 
Well he got called away.
had to go to a breakdown, the poor bloke didn't know whether he was coming or going so one of these situations that stress stress arrives.
Yeah but as I say I just want to make it clear to people that it's er it's a bit of both and I think a bit of bit of heated argument was
This morning they're different again down there cos I've been down there and I've looked at the situation erm and I've had a word with the lads there and I will try and alter it a little bit more.
Which I'm g 
Give them a week then and give them their radio back then.
I gave them some er jackets and trousers that I got in stock down there that's that's that's it then yeah .
I see.
er us I went to  yesterday the the the borehole is now fully covered in secure er and the water system is working well.
I  as well but he's still a load of water on the top.
A lot of water.
Did you get the .
Took it home last night  .
He took it home last night I w I got it going I got the time on it but I
He couldn't find an eleven year old kid to do it.
Because it's like an M F I.
Y all you need is an eleven year old kid, you can't do it can you.
take it home and sort it out.
Well apparently Paul his his erm his mate up there he's done works on the B T so he'll set it for him.
Nobody works for B T.
Only the buggers that send the bills out.
While I was there we had the council man there.
And he he wasn't he said  they can only stand the water problem so long so what they can do with it I don't know.
I keep saying I said to Dennis, well it's on our property.
There will be a report coming through because the chap from the council believe it or not, said, Oh this should be undercover.
and it's true it's right.
Dennis said, I've got asthma, you're not putting this under cover.
But I mean when I went  going towards  they were screening it you know, seeing it.
It was .
water on then.
Yeah.
Well you see you you don't put water on when you put  screening system
No.
it's when it comes through isn't it.
the stuff that they're using now is crap it's nothing like 
it once was it's just so it's just absolute dust.
Sawdust isn't it.
Well when Tom  
It's wo it's p It's not actually sawdust it's wood flour.
It is yeah.
Absolutely crap Yeah it's nothing like it was I mean 
why you know what I don't know what's changed in the meantime or whether we're paying different rates or whatever, but if you take the material that we were getting in two three years ago when first time I was involved, it's just absolutely nothing like.
And there's no wonder it's blowing away cos it's just lighter than air.
I mean in terms of stock 
Well it is  you're right.
in stock out
I shudder to think.
I mean yesterday was yesterday really was there wasn't a deal of wind at all but  bloody sandstorm  
If it dries up for three or four days  it's st dries up for three or four days and Dennis has to stop  the minute he picks it up it's just blown away.
That's right, you get so much in the hopper you get seventy five percent 
Yeah and it's blown away.
in the hopper whup and then the rest is in the field.
Well that's the first first I've heard about the change to it.
Do you want to samples bringing d Pete's going up on
Tomorrow.
Yeah Pete's going up tomorrow do you want some 
Who's responsible who's responsible  
Who buys the timber?
who buys the D I Y.
Well it's bought in it was an original contract that was  but we buy it through here.
We set the coShe is mine anyway.
You're afraid of me? 
of a boy?
Ttied me to a tree.
I am alone and you've got so many men. 
Are you a man after that?
Let's go to the river and fight there.
Hear me? 
Or is it so that the highland customs mean nothing to you?
I'll kill you!
Hey, you!
Untie the boy!
Strange..
I'm left completely alone.
What do I do?
Where do I go?
Follow the birds, son.
It's all easier for the birds.
They're in the sky.
And I am on the ground.
How do I live?
How do live here, where everyone hates, robs and kills each other?
Why are they so cruel?
Teach me how to live with these people.
The almond has blossomed again in the mountains.
Man must be strong, brave, clever and decisive.
Be careful, jackals and wolfs come out in the mountains at night.
Defend yourself.
Once again.
Good boy.

- Nikolai Nikolayevich is sleeping?
- He's not at home.
He and Sophia Alexeyevna are vacationing at Belaya Tserkov.
You can go!
Marie!
Sorry for not having come sooner.
It was beyond my powers.
Here, the letters from Pushkin.
Believe me, Marie, I missed you very much.
Pestel has been arrested!
Pavel Ivanovich?
What for?
The regiment under my command will have to place under arrest the commander-in-chief and the head of the staff.
The Northern Society is for the preservation of the monarchy.
The Southern Society intends to abolish it.
To abolish the monarchy overnight is impossible, especially here, in Russia.
It can only be restricted by the law, like in Britain.
But that will be a republic, Prince.
Your arguments are useless.
We detest the ignominy of serfdom.
Pestel is not married.
Not married... 
Pestel...
Neither is Kakhovsky.
Nor Muraviev-Apostol.
But Ryleyev...
His wife... and daughter...
I'll give orders to serve dinner.
The czar will certainly come to review the troops.
His death will be a signal to action.
We in the South want to know if the Northerners agree to regicide.
I'm pleased with your brigade, Prince.
I only regret that you haven't got rid of that spirit of giddiness.
It'd be much more profitable if you devoted yourself to military affairs.
Sire...
- I don't know the reason why...
- You're too smart, Volkonsky.
Beware, Prince, you had let yourself get carried away with matters that don't concern you when you were in Paris.
True, I myself had encouraged those extravagant dreams, and even ordered to draft a Constitution.
Though I realize now that it's of no use in an enlightened monarchy.
Nor did I rescind the ban on the society you're a member of.
And don't try to deny it.
The tyrant's blood will deliver our country of the autocracy.
We can't but agree with the Southerners' plan, Prince.
If, by the spring, the Tsar doesn't grant the Constitution he'd promised...
And what if he doesn't?
Gentlemen, I will wait until 1926, and, during a review of the troops, confess my guilt.
The Tsar will have me executed.
But he will grant Russia the statutes you failed to obtain.
The thunder will strike, gentlemen!
Perhaps I deserve to be condemned...
If something goes awry,
I hope you will at least try to understand us.
Us?
Oh God, us?
Maria!
What is it?
Oh, God, what does it mean?
Maria! 
Masha!
Oh, my God! 
An omen!
It's an omen!
A bad omen!
O Lord! 
Forgive me!
She must be by the swing.
Maria!
Mashenka!
Masha, hush, hush...
Nothing really happened.
Calm down.
I could never imagine such a thing.
Enough, Mashenka, calm down.
It was really nothing.
Come on, what's the matter with you?
Turn back!
Turn back, Your Excellency!
They put a guard at your house.
Don't go to Uman!
A courier from St. Petersburg...
He brought the Tsar's order about your arrest...
Turn back, Your Excellency.
It's too late to turn back.
Ippolit!
Ippolit, please.
Here, these are my letters to my wife.
Distribute them, so that they are sent from different places.
My wife is still too weak.
I want her to learn about it as late as possible.
Yes, sir, I'll do it.
Go!
By the winter of 1825-1826, the Russian gentry was deeply divided.
The accession of Nicholas I, to replace the dead Emperor Alexander, was marked by a revolt.
Who is going to report about me to the Tsar?
Are you joking, Captain?
There's been no order to arrest you.
On the day of taking an oath of allegiance, you were in the barracks.
Isn't that so?
But I joined the rebels when the guns were aimed at them.
You're slandering yourself.
I was a member of the secret society, and I must share their fate.
He's lost a lot of blood, and had nothing to eat for two days.
He gave up his sword of his own free will, but when he was led to the guardhouse, he offered resistance, and, therefore, was tied up.
In view of his hunger swoon...
He's been wounded. 
Let him remain seated.
I knew it would be you here.
You said, exterminate the august family? 
Was it you?
No, I never said it to anybody.
Let him eat.
I never said it to anybody, but I've been thinking of it all the time.
Stand up!
Insulting the most august highnesses?
!
Excuse me! 
How can I insult their highnesses?
They have fortresses, the army and fleet. 
They fire with case-shot!
What do they care if I say:
you, Nikolai Pavlovich, are a pig?
How dare you sit in the presence of...
Scoundrel! 
Swine!
Scum! 
Scum!
Put him in irons, so he can't even move! 
Scoundrel!
You used to swear better when you were in the army.
Catherine!
- Whatever you may be told about us...
- Don't say anything!
Only God can judge you, Serge!
You and your friends.
Mister Ambassador, I'm sorry, the Russian officials are here, the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself...
What happened, Mister Minister?
So early in the morning at my house?
I'm very sorry to disturb you at this untimely hour, but your relative,
Prince Trubetskoy, spent the night at your house.
If the Prince remains at your embassy, you'll be presented a note.
I have sent for the Prince, but if he doesn't wish to come out...
- It's so awful!
- I hope everything'll be all right.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
The Emperor wishes to see you.
When?
Immediately.
What are you doing, Prince?
I hope, Ludwig, you will take care of Catherine.
Catherine!
What are you doing here?
You can expect anything from those soldiers!
Father, I beg you, tell me, where is Serge?
Trubetskoy is not here!
Where is Serge?
Go away, quick, these are the rebels!
The rebels? 
Here?
Where is Serge? 
I'm begging you!
Get away from here, quick!
Go now!
Do you have at least one company?
Your Majesty, the artillery swore their allegiance, the guns are out.
Your Majesty!
The Grenadiers are outside.
You'd better go back, Your Majesty.
These are the mutineers.
You're too late with your advice, General.
Good morning, boys!
Don't you recognize me?
Your Majesty, a company of the First Preobrazhensky Regiment is here.
But, through some misunderstanding, their rifles are not loaded.
- Looking for somebody, Lieutenant?
- For my company, Your Highness!
In that case, we'll make way for you, go ahead.
Open order!
Open up from the center!
Hurray for the constitution!
Trubetskoy!
Soldiers! 
Perhaps no one has ever seen me, or heard of me?
Who remembers me? 
Who knows me?
Tell me, soldiers, those who'd served with me don't remember either?
Neither the Moscow Regiment men remember...
Nor the Grenadiers...
But if I remind you in what battles I was with you... in what campaigns... where we were freezing in the snow together?
They probably don't understand to whom they should swear their oath.
For our Tsar! 
For our Motherland!
To the Tsar? 
Or to the Constitution?
Though I don't know what it means...
Who of you was with me at Kulm and Leipzig,
Amstetten,
Brienna, Prechampenoise and Krems,
Bucharest, Obelesti,
Lake Oberalt, at Tarutino,
Vilna and Borodino?
No one was?
Thank God! 
There's not a single Russian soldier here.
If there was at least one officer, or one soldier here, then you would know who Miloradovich is!
There're only rookies here!
Brawlers! 
Vagabonds! 
Scoundrels!
You've shamed the name of the Russian soldier!
The honor of the military man!
You are a disgrace to Russia!
You are criminals betraying your Tsar, your Motherland, and God Himself!
What are you up to?
What are you doing?
On your knees before the lawful sovereign Nikolai Pavlovich!
On your knees, boys! 
All of you!
The general is wounded!
Yes, Eugene.
While sharing your views, we remain Loyal to the crown and our Tsar, whom we despise as a deceiver!
Dear Serge, habit is everything for a Russian man.
You said it yourself recently.
Prince Trubetskoy, are you familiar with these sheets?
Prince Sergey Petrovich! 
Answer me!
Manifesto.
"Save, O Lord, Your people, and bless Your heritage.
Abolition of the former rule...
Abolition of the right of ownership of human beings...
Equality of all classes before the law..."
The landowner, the merchant, the craftsman and the peasant - they all have equal rights?
Was it you who wrote this?
Please, try to remember.
"The Russian people are not the belonging, nor the property of a person, or a family.
The slavery of serfdom should be radically abolished."
This is your handwriting.
A revolution in Russia is as preposterous as a woman grenadier.
Why does a European bourgeois take a dagger in his hand?
To usurp the rights he doesn't have, to rob and pillage.
Even if it's a society like the Mason loge, I visited them, too.
A lot of noise, agitation and verbal determination.
But once they return to their homes, all is quiet again.
His Imperial Majesty the Tsar Alexander Pavlovich!
We're getting old, Miloradovich.
Russia needs new power, new energy.
We live in the hard times, fields are sown poorly for the shortage of grain.
Peasants' food is loathsome, there's no bread.
They're being sold by the piece, their families broken, wives corrupted, maidens robbed of their virginity.
And all this is done in the open!
The oppressors have no fear!
The gentry think they own the honor, property and life itself!
Negroes on plantations are happier than our peasants.
There are monsters who make peasant women breastfeed borzoi puppies.
Any member of the gentry who opposes the act of liberation cannot but be called the enemy of the country.
And the first and foremost enemy is the Emperor himself.
I'm tired.
I trust in God, for it is said:
I boast when I feel my infirmity, then the Lord will strengthen me...
Is that your hand?
Yes, mine.
What have you done?
What on earth have you done?
!
Prince Trubetskoy!
Of such a noble family!
Colonel of the Guards!
What was going on in that head of yours... when you decided to link your name to that filth?
Leave us!
Your fate is going to be horrible.
Horrible...
Such a lovely wife.
You've ruined your wife's life.
O Lord...
I could shoot you right away.
Life would be a shame and punishment for you.
Shoot me.
Levashov!
You're lucky, Sergey Petrovich, that you don't have children.
Come what may!
Don't be afraid, Mademoiselle, I've got a magic touch, we'll get through!
Somehow or other!
What the heck! 
By guess and by God!
You intended to shoot the fortress's whole garrison, Mademoiselle?
And all this because of Lieutenant Annenkov?
By the way, you arrived just in time.
Today your friend was taken out of the noose.
Oh, my God!
Wait! 
Where are you going?
Wait!
As you were!
Calm down, the towel had gone loose, he was brought to his senses.
You can't detain me. 
It's been two days since I left Moscow.
Two days, Monsieur.
You have no heart!
The Russians have changed so much!
As though the guillotine had been invented in Kostroma.
In your country, all the mutineers would have been executed long ago.
You're right, Monsieur! 
But they'd be entitled to have defense lawyers.
A petition for a visit must be handed in to the investigation commission, then it will be submitted for the highest consideration.
- Do you understand?
- No.
I could make it clear to you in Russian.
Monsieur, you're so strong, and I'm so weak.
And I have come as far as here.
Can it be that you, so strong a man, will not help me, all alone in a strange country?
That's all I've got left.
It was given to me by my mother.
Somehow or other!
Take what comes!
Troshka!
Your Honour!
Mademoiselle Pauline!
The life of a cavalry guard's not long, Hence it's the sweetest in the world.
The trumpet sounds, a bedspread thrown, And distant saber rattle heard.
The guitar sings without fading, Yet the commander rushes forth.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
At last.
Lieutenant, what are you doing here?
Excuse me, Mademoiselle, but I'm at my home.
What do you mean? 
Isn't that a coaching inn?
It's no tragedy. 
You'll take a night's rest from that bug-infested place.
I don't understand. 
Is that your house?
This is my mother's estate.
There's about 100 kg of silver here...
I'm scared being alone with roaches...
And crickets...
And on Holy Day, so much wine and smoking. 
What will your mother say?
Mother will have us flogged.
There's not a soul in the house except this deaf woman.
No one will disturb you here.
In vain you try prolong the story Of peaceful games with laughter filled:
You'll never come by a lasting glory Unless somebody's blood is spilled.
The sweet sublime world notwithstanding, Anxiety knit your brow doth.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
Twenty kilometers on foot are a dubious pleasure.
It's getting late.
It would be more prudent to come back.
Leave me alone!
I insist on it!
Oh? 
So if you don't love me...
What are you going to do then?
- I'll fight!
- With whom?
With anyone who dares to look at you!
And if it's not only one man?
I'll fight them all!
You'll get killed, and it will serve you right!
I love you like a madman!
Thousands of Russians and your compatriots lost their lives here.
There was war here in 1812.
Who knows, maybe my uncle's remains lie in these parts, he was the jolliest man in the world.
My uncle and my father served Bonaparte.
Your father fought against Russia?
No, he died in the Spanish Kingdom.
I was orphaned when I was not yet nine.
Stop it! 
These sounds have been giving me a shudder since I was a child.
My father hated Bonaparte.
Any royalist would've paid with his life for sympathy to the Bourbons.
Though any revolution means blood, orphanhood and suffering.
However, if there has been no shake-up in France,
I would have never met you in Russia.
Jean! 
I'll arrange for your escape.
I'll bribe the soldiers, I'll put the officer to sleep or poison him.
You'll go in hiding abroad.
I can't, I must share the fate of my comrades.
No, it's impossible!
I've already prepared everything!
I must share the fate of my comrades.
So much the better.
Fate has set everything straight and spared you the cruel lot of becoming the wife of a convict.
You're insane!
I would be happy to become the wife of an outcast if it could only alleviate your suffering.
Is it true?
God's servant loann plights his troth to God's servant Paraskeviya.
Are you joining this holy wedlock of your good and unconstrained will?
- Excuse me, what does it all mean?
- What do you mean?
We'll be right back.
Mademoiselle Pauline!
Can you explain what's going on?
Look, even if I were dying of hunger,
I wouldn't have married a bag of money.
Have a safe journey, Mademoiselle.
Goodbye!
So you don't like me?
Bravo, Lieutenant! 
At last you thought of such a trifle!
You're too arrogant!
I despise you!
An arrogant and conceited brat!
Oh, my God! 
What an idiot!
- Leave me alone! 
Go away!
- I don't believe you, Mademoiselle!
Shut up!
I hate you!
Is it true?
It's true, Jean, I want to be your wife.
No one can suspect me of mercenary intentions now.
Even those at the fashion house where I still work.
Your purse, Mademoiselle.
Listen... 
Listen, Jean...
Thank you, Pauline.
But I'm not worthy of your love.
You will meet someone you'll love.
You're going to be happy.
Forget about me!
Forget me forever!
Jean!
Jean, don't dare saying that!
I'll never be happy without you!
It's all over for me!
Goodbye!
I'll live in peace, and as the death angel cometh, I'll hold out my hands...
Mademoiselle, it's dawn already.
The mistress asks you to come in.
She wasn't receiving you, because they dined all night.
...I want to save a place for a man to whom I'll be inseparably tied forever.
Oh, my dear friend! 
What torments of grief my heart has experienced!
Oh, my lord, that's the end, very soon my brother will be united in wedlock with Miss Clementine!
Poor Henriette!
What a lot for a maiden whose beauty adorns the Universe...
I'm very sorry, Madame, but I must tell you that your son is imprisoned in a fortress.
Mademoiselle is saying that His Excellency Ivan Alexandrovich is in a fortress.
He must have gotten into debts again?
Madame... 
Madame...
His life is in danger.
Listen to what he's written!
"I don't even have a pin at hand, with which to put an end to my existence."
Ivan Alexandrovich wants to kill himself.
That will make our relatives so happy, they will get everything, scoundrels.
Only you can afford to buy a foreign passport for your son.
And I'll arrange everything else.
Yes, the passport, the master must flee...
My son? 
A fugitive?
That will never be!
Your answer is fit for the Romans, but their time has gone.
Jean is a child.
Ivan Alexandrovich is a little child.
Some child, to have picked up that masonic pest from the French and wanting to marry a French woman.
Aren't you that French woman?
Strengthen us, O Lord, in our infirmity.
I was pierced to the bottom of my heart.
You should marry an English girl, not the Italian one.
Don't make the choice that may dishonor Clementine.
I've got a proud heart.
I want you to remember me with affection.
Neither the summer heat, nor the winter cold...
Mother, it's...
Mother, it's time for me to think of building a family.
And my spirit was exalted...
Who told you to come to Moscow?
Mother, I've got a bride.
Will you please hear me out?
Well?
.
Have you found her in St. Petersburg?
You saw her, but you probably don't remember.
She works here, at the French fashion house.
It was only I who knew you're a fool, now the whole Moscow will know.
May your gracious hand heal me.
Covering her delicate daughter with endless kisses,
Marquise had moistened her with her tears.
Mother, don't make me go to extremes.
My intention is very well considered, I won't give up.
Don't give up, you won't scare me.
You may marry even a peasant girl.
Are you depriving me of my inheritance?
Clementine was fascinated by your handsomeness. 
I don't deserve you...
- Mother, you mean you've cursed me?
- Get out!
You haven't given me your answer.
Fyodor!
Don't give horses to Ivan!
Let him get out of here on his own!
He takes after me, not like Grishka.
At least I have somebody to leave the inheritance to.
- Go and beg your mother...
- Listen, Fyodor...
Can one who's deprived of his inheritance be called a bag of money?
Oh, no, master...
Is it really so, master? 
Oh, God...
That's the answer!
Wait!
Come on, catch her!
What does it mean?
!
Leave me alone!
You abominable, dirty creatures!
Leave me alone!
Beasts!
Don't be angry.
You'll live here, you'll marry a general, and forget about my stupid son.
You know how many diamonds you're wearing?
They are worth a hundred thousand, or maybe even more.
I'll be giving balls.
Give back my dress.
So finicky.
Come on, Prince, it's not my intention to find you guilty.
On the contrary, I'm giving you an opportunity to justify yourself.
But my situation is unenviable when I'm not trusted.
Meanwhile, I'm only the first citizen of our country.
You took up arms against a friend of your cause and thus tied my intentions.
From the high position I'm placed at, one cannot but see that even if any particular persons were guilty, there had also been some general reasons for indignation.
A lot of people are involved.
It's more important for me to know that, than whether someone's guilty.
You have a wife, the daughter of Rayevsky.
Your son was born recently.
You may rest assured, Prince, your children are my children.
If you promise to be Loyal to the crown, I'll be able to forgive you.
Thank God, we thought something had happened to you.
How is she?
Did the doctor call?
Calm down, Prince, the doctor was here.
Though all was clear without him.
- What was clear?
- Fits of sickness are inevitable.
God willing, we'll have a grandchild in winter.
If you can, Sergey Grigorievich, please, don't leave me for long periods of time.
We never spend time together.
It's so strange, I don't know you at all.
Levashov!
Please.
I can pardon you, Prince Sergey Grigorievich.
That's the trouble that you can do anything, you're above the law.
And I would like your subjects to be dependent on the law, and not on your will, caprices or momentary moods.
Put him in irons!
Incarcerate as a villain!
He's a complete fool, that Prince!
Or a liar and an utter scoundrel...
There you go, little prince!
There you go, Mikolushka!
Mikolushka! 
That's a boy!
Yegor!
- Why is this door locked?
- I was told to lock it for the night.
Then unlock it.
Yes, Your Excellency, we'll report it to Alexander Nikolayevich.
Marie! 
Marie!
What's the matter?
Marie!
Hiding the mail from me? 
I learn about the winter troubles from hearsay.
Not a single letter from Sergey.
And now this house arrest!
What are you talking about, Marie?
The prince is probably at the Turkish border. 
Father will come and tell us.
Father is in St. Petersburg, not in Bessarabia.
I'm tired, Alexander.
Since the first days of this awful year I've been so depressed, and you're indulging me with some inventions.
It doesn't befit our friendship.
It's even cruel.
Please, understand, no torture can be worse than uncertainty.
If you don't tell me now where Sergey is, I'm going to St. Petersburg.
And you know me, I don't waste words.
Sergey Grigorievich...
how shall I put it...
What happened to him?
Well, all right...
He has been sent to St. Petersburg.
You see...
Say it!
He took part in the antigovernment conspiracy.
Thank you!
- How shall I announce you?
- Colonel Pestel.
Come on in, be so kind.
Please accept our deepest apologies for intruding at such a late hour.
- Something happened?
- We have to be in Uman by morning.
Allow me to introduce Prince Yablonovsky and Mr. Grodetsky.
- You'd better spend the night here.
- It's out of the question, Prince.
We must go to Warsaw immediately.
The Polish Society is waiting for our answer.
Just married and now back to my regiment?
There may be not another such opportunity for a year or longer.
When and where?
Tomorrow in Uman, at your apartment at 1 p.m.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you. 
I knew I could rely on you.
Marie!
Thank you!
Are you glad?
There's no such awful thing Volkonsky hadn't been involved in.
He has a fortress in store for him, or even more horrible... hard labor.
The most horrible is behind us.
Now he will need me.
The night of July 12-13, 1826.
These state criminals condemned to political death,
upon being deprived of ranks, orders and the status of nobility, are to be exiled to hard labor according to the categories.
Lieutenant Annenkov! 
Stop it!
- What is it?
- It hasn't been cut out right!
Proposed to deprive the Emperor and his Imperial family of freedom when seizing the palace.
Directed the Northern secret society which plotted mutiny.
Agreed to be named the head and ringleader of the army revolt, though did not participate in it personally.
Who could know there'd be such a delay with logs.
- And what's the problem?
- The cart broke down on the way.
Come on, men...
Let's take it down together.
We must do it together.
The ropes are too short!
Such a bad luck...
What happened?
Bring him here right away!
What have you been sent to Russia for?
You have no executions anymore.
Where did your Swedish brains look?
We'll have to wait, Your Excellency.
Mouzhik do mistakes.
Poles not deep.
Bring benches, quick!
What a miserable empire!
They can't even hang people properly.
Bring the Commandant to His Excellency!
If we don't act, we'll deserve to be called scoundrels.
That I would consider a failure!
We must only start, this is in our power.
Military bravery and political foolhardiness are not the same thing.
In the present circumstances, an uprising means death!
Yes, we will die, but we'll set an example for the others.
...To put to death
Pavel Pestel, Kondraty Ryleyev, Sergey Muraviev-Apostol,
Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin and Pyotr Kakhovsky, as determined by the court verdict.
For their heinous deeds, these criminals are to be hanged.
What day is today?
O Lord, stretch forth Thine hand on Your servants.
Pardon their transgressions, deliver their souls, O Lord, in Your realm!
Give me your hand.
Listen... does my heart beat faster?
Give my husband back to me!
Give my husband back to me!
Don't make him perish!
Nastenka! 
Beg father!
Beg him, Nastenka!
Beg him for yourself and for me!
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, who has left His commandments to His disciples and apostles...
Where's the Commandant?
Your Excellency, a message from His Majesty!
His Highness summons you to his side!
Hangman! 
Oprichnik!
Take off your aiguillettes!
Strangle us with your aiguillettes!
They may be more durable!
Yes, Your Excellency!
Have you come here to watch us dying, General?
You can make your Tsar happy, his wish has come true:
we're dying in torments.
Hurry up, hang them!
The ropes are no good!
We should send for the new ones.
I'm dying in torments!
But I'm happy that I'm dying twice for my Fatherland!
Ones who broke loose were pardoned in Russia. 
Shall we inform the Tsar?
.
Hang them!
Pardon them who hate us and hurt us, for not one of them will perish for us...
O Lord, You Savior of all through Your mercy, all-generous God, the Savior of all through Your mercy!
O Lord, all-generous God!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
It's done, Your Majesty!
We pay our particular attention to the situation of the families from which, by a criminal action, their fallen sons had been torn away.
Blood ties pass on to the descendants the glory of their ancestors' deeds, but never hold them up to disgrace for personal vices or crimes.
No one.
No one shall ever dare find fault for the blood relationship.
This is prohibited by the civil law, to say nothing of the Christian law.
What were you trying to tell me?
There's a pretty venomous opinion going the rounds, Your Majesty.
The cobbler in Europe rebels, because he seeks wealth and high standing.
And what on earth do our revolutionaries of noble birth want?
They must be dreaming of becoming cobblers.
Gen. Rayevsky shall be made a member of the State Council as a Senator.
Tell me, Prince, what's your response to the whim of my daughter?
You must tell Maria that you're rejecting her sacrifice.
Write about the hardships she'll experience if she follows you.
The letter must dispel her illusions, she'll lose hope and calm down.
You mean...
You mean she'll forget me?
Petersburg, Petersburg, Petersburg, Chernigov...
Will you repeat it, please?
Of course, to Princess Yekaterina Trubetskaya, English Embankment...
He hasn't gone a hundred miles yet, and already the third letter.
Prince Sergey, be a man, be a Christian.
You've ruined her life, at least don't become her murderer!
She has a frail health, she won't endure the horror of the journey.
Prince Sergey, don't be an egotist!
Your responsibility as father and husband...
Wasn't it your intention to abolish the autocracy?
And to replace the monarch with the conspirators?
Who told you all that?
If we are destined to be successful, the Society's members will immediately withdraw from political life.
Wait, Prince, you subject yourself cold-bloodedly to the danger of dishonor, shame, maybe even losing your life.
And if you're successful?
No reward for the risk?
All we could hope for is that our descendants remember us well.
And had my participation in the Society's cause stood in the way of my happy family life,
I would rather, albeit grudgingly, have renounced that happiness than betrayed my convictions and duty.
Oh, gracious God!
How could you go to the altar with such a sin in your heart?
Good night.
I'll do everything as you ask.
Goodbye.
May God save you.
I'm so sorry...
May God save you, martyrs to the truth!
It's 2,000 versts to Yekaterinburg.
Oh, my goodness!
About 7,000 to Irkutsk.
Unbelievable!
And 800 more to Nerchinsk...
Yes, Princess.
Byron. 
Plutarch.
I understand your feelings, Princess.
But in such matters I'm obliged to follow the established regulations.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Count Orlov's seamstress was allowed to follow her convicted husband to Siberia.
Have you been inspired by a common woman's act?
The seamstress was not losing much, whereas you...
The law cannot deprive a noble woman of what's allowed to a commoner.
By insisting on the rights of commoners, a woman of noble birth may reduce herself to...
Everything is ready, Count!
Catherine, my poor child!
To flee the French Revolution, only to give your daughter to a conspirator!
Support us, o Lord, in well-being and prosperity...
Save, Lord, thy servant...
Yes, Princess.
Let's go, with God's help!
Mommy, let's go!
Let's go, mommy!
Mommy, let's go!
Wait.
Your Majesty!
Wait!
Will you please speak Russian?
I don't speak Russian.
Come closer.
- What would you like?
- Hear me out, Sire!
Your Majesty, as a special favour, please allow me to join Lieutenant Annenkov in his exile.
Is he your husband?
I would have wedded him if I wished to transgress the bounds of propriety.
I've decided on that daring act after learning that Russian women who wished to follow their husbands found compassion in you.
But this is not your country, Madame!
I'll renounce my country.
Take her petition.
Your Majesty!
Stop, I beg you!
Europe talks about your mercifulness to the families of the wretched men.
A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country.
Europe didn't doubt my heart.
I'll give you the answer in 3 days.
To own serfs, to revel in luxury, and to consider oneself free?
For heaven's sake, gentlemen!
Will the life of our gentry forever stagnate from corruption and idleness?
Isn't that ignominy going to arouse shame and disgust in us?
What will you say, Lieutenant?
I'm ashamed of the class I belong to.
I'm a slave, just like my mother's house serfs.
The only difference is that I'm conscious of my enslavement.
Natalie, baby, where are you going?
Fedya!
Fedya!
Fedya!
Sometimes I even treated my old servant who adored me in the manner of a true son of my mother.
Where were you hiding, Fedya?
All right, I'm forgiving you this time.
Thank you very much, sir.
The other day your mother bought 100 yards of fabric for a dress.
Don't talk rubbish.
And it's not the first time.
As soon as there's an expensive fabric on sale, she buys it all, so that in all Moscow, and not only in Moscow, in all Russia, only she had a dress like that.
Ivan!
Oh, Our Lady in Heaven, save Vanechka from trouble!
Brush it up.
Stop jerking the comb!
Let me see.
All right, leave that lock there.
I'm sick and tired of you, Ivan.
The last time you killed someone in a duel, now you've lost 60 thousand.
Tomorrow morning you're going to St. Petersburg.
I'm not giving you any cash.
You'll be fed by Fedka on your way.
I myself will pay your debt.
Don't dare meet your brother.
Come on, kiss my hand!
And don't dare coming to me in Moscow without my permission!
Sir Roland squeezed her hand...
Oh God, the same pleasantness, the same loveliness on that dear face.
"Don't squeeze my hand so, Sir Roland," I interrupted his speech.
"You will sadden me if you make me repeat..."
Mademoiselle Pauline!
Champagne is poured in a flow, And misty view somewhat obscured,
With everything, just take and go, With everything as if for good.
A wooden cross it'll be, or leaden, With which to death we're betrothed.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
Only inequality stood between me and her.
You may not believe me, Sire, but my arrest had even made me happy.
The barrier that stood in the way of our union with her has disappeared.
At last I'm stripped of all rights, of my fortune, of my status of gentry.
Wait!
Stand back!
I would gladly pardon you, Cavalry Guard.
Only tell me, since you knew of the conspiracy, why didn't you report it?
Did you hear the question?
Answer it!
Well?
.
It's not honourable to report on your comrades.
What do you know about honour?
!
- Do you know what you deserve?
- Death, Sire.
Do you expect to be shot?
And cut an interesting figure?
No.
I'll make you rot in prison.
What are you doing?
!
What's on your mind?
And you, why didn't you watch him?
What for?
I'm not going to live.
- Faster!
- We can't go faster than that...
Hurry up, please!
Quick! 
Go!
We need to change horses, and where can we get new ones?
- Here.
- Thank you very much.
Somehow or other.
Come what may! 
Faster!
We'll get you there!
Jean!
Jean!
Wait! 
Stop!
Jean! 
Jean!
Don't leave!
The Emperor's answer!
- How long will we stay here?
- I guess we can fix it in a week.
Seven days?
!
It's been badly broken, Your Excellency, we rode like crazy!
We'll have to travel by relay horses.
- But it means a springless cart.
- Other people use it.
People? 
Only mouzhiks and convicts.
- Did they carry them on carts?
- Sure thing.
God will help us.
What's the matter, Charles?
Madame, think about your parents!
I promised them that we return if the journey is dangerous.
I'm in despair! 
Why didn't I convince you to spend the night in Tomsk?
I've seen a wolf!
Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna has ordered to take you to Tomsk.
I've got the money for our journey to St. Petersburg and your salary.
She took her carefully and brought her home, made a little nest, just like for Mikola Sergeyevich,
put Katechka in there and went to the woods to pick mushrooms...
"I'm always under surveillance, even more strict than in a fortress.
You must obey your sense of responsibility.
You're a mother and a daughter.
I'm ready to sacrifice everything, if only it will give you peace.
My precious friend Marie!
Whatever you may decide, and even if this decision will deprive me of the hope of ever seeing you, that sorrow of mine will be alleviated by the belief
that you fully partake of my plight and that your decision was caused by the cruel circumstances."
I don't believe it!
I'll never reproach you for anything.
Darling Sergey!
Nikolai Pavlovich questioned me at some length about the prince.
Of course, I tried to vindicate Sergey as well as I could.
But it was impossible to belittle the prince's guilt.
The Tsar even said that Volkonsky is unworthy of our sympathy.
I wouldn't have stopped to extirpate my respect for him and consider my daughter's obligations annulled.
But I understand her: nothing is worse than eternal separation from him.
Don't worry, father.
I have no other troubles except those that concern Sergey.
I guess one has to have a stronger willpower, not to devote oneself to those who need it.
I know I will be able to endure anything being beside Sergey.
You want to bury yourself alive?
In the name of what?
Volkonsky is a conspirator!
Your foremost duty now is your son!
You're going to kill your son!
Enough!
Only a year ago you were persuading me of my fiance's virtues.
And today you deny me a consolation.
I want you to know that I love my husband.
And I expect from you at least a little compassion.
You're deceiving yourself.
You don't feel anything for him.
I guess it's the Volkonsky women's letters that speak for her.
Oh, God...
And first of all, his mother's, who'd gone out of her mind long ago.
They convinced her she's a heroine, and she tortures herself like a fool.
Look, Masha, if I knew that you were going there for love, that your delusion would not dissipate,
I would have agreed to bury you alive.
I would've wept over you with tears of blood and let you go, nonetheless.
I can use my power to stop you.
But, please, stop yourself!
Coming to your senses in Siberia would be a tragedy for you.
Have pity for your father, Marie!
Masha!
Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna!
Welcome!
You're the last person I expected to see in this house.
Governor Tsejdler at your service.
Please, have a seat.
Allow me to remain standing.
I understand. 
It's no laughing matter:
so many versts on our bad roads.
- Pafnuti!
- Yes, I know, Your Excellency!
Could you tell me... why I was not given horses?
There must be none.
It's strange, because the postmaster pleaded some ban.
Yes, yes, yes... 
Excuse me.
You see, I must inform you about something.
If you wish to proceed to Nerchinsk,
I'm obliged to inform you of the measures to be applied to you.
If I wish?
You think I've gone all that way just to meet you here?
Nevertheless, you'll have to hear me out.
Are you aware that all this will have to be sent back?
Nor are you allowed to take with you any sums of money or valuable things.
But that is not all.
Your right to own serfs will be revoked as soon as you move beyond Irkutsk.
So your servants will not go with you.
All right, they won't.
I suspect, Princess, that you...
You have no idea of what your life at the mines is going to be like.
You will live there like the poorest peasant.
Really?
The huts are dirty, stinking, full of insects.
Your food will be bread and kvass.
I hate to mention the climate: it's horrible, it'll be pernicious for you.
But I'll be there with my husband.
You're right.
But don't forget, Princess, that your husband is in prison.
You'll be allowed rare visits, once a week, no more, for one hour in a convicts' room, with an officer present.
I see... one hour...
an officer... present...
Please, order them to give me horses!
Have you fully realized that all the rest time you'll be alone among the savage population?
In the barracks you'll be surrounded by 5,000 branded convicts belonging to the most corrupt and despicable class.
But the mines must be managed by someone?
The management won't be able to protect you from insults which may even come to violence.
Aren't they punished there for crimes?
Princess, hardened villains fear no punishment.
They will even deem it right to consider you their equal, as the wife of a criminal sharing their lot.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, the samovar is boiling.
Would you like some tea, Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna?
This beverage is indispensable here.
God will help me.
Will you tell them to give me horses?
Please!
As you wish, Princess.
Written here is everything I've warned you about.
Your signature will mean you'll submit to all those measures.
Now can you send me on my way as soon as possible?
I'm sorry, Princess, but this paper has to go to St. Petersburg for His Imperial Majesty's consideration.
By courier.
How long am I supposed to wait, General?
A month one way, a month back.
And how long it will take the Tsar to look into it and give his answer... that, as you may understand, does not depend on me.
Will you wait?
Or prefer to go back home?
Oh, God!
Don't torture yourself, Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna.
You're pure before God.
Where are you going, Madame?
Have pity!
We were told not to let you in!
Don't you hear? 
Have mercy!
I didn't think I would ever enter your house again.
However, before going to Siberia,
I want to give you an opportunity to regain your son's favour.
Madame has learned that her son, Grigory, was killed in a duel.
Oh, my God...
Wait.
Get out.
I see you're not of the weak kind, Mademoiselle.
But it's hard for a foreign woman to take a journey to Siberia. 
Don't go.
I'll buy you a house in Moscow.
You'll have everything.
Only don't leave.
As soon as I'm dead, our relatives will take possession of everything here.
My son is young.
It won't be too hard for him.
His mother needs you much more.
It's impossible.
I know how scrupulous you are.
Take it, it will come handy in Siberia.
Give your support to Ivan.
I'm surrounded by monsters here.
The moment you leave, they'll poison me.
I'll pray for you!
Ivan doesn't deserve such a beauty.
Sure thing, dear mistress...
He doesn't deserve her, mistress, a rake what he is...
Hold your tongue!
Thank you most humbly.
She must pray and pray for Vanechka, that French trash!
As for taking your son with you...
As for taking your son with you...
Mommy!
...It can't be permitted...
can't be permitted...
Mommy!
All my prayers are about my son, Our Lady Mother of God!
I already love the child who hasn't been born yet.
I would sooner feel affection for my husband when I see his likeness in a child, his flesh and blood.
Help me, O Lord, help me...
To admit these feelings for the father of my future child...
It's a sin! 
A sin!
- Have you delivered mail?
- Just as you said, sir.
- Is Masha in her room?
- She went up to the children's room.
Did you call me, father?
I was playing in the garden.
Sit down, Masha.
Prince Sergey Grigorievich Volkonsky asks for your hand.
The prince is a fine man, from a good family.
I'm sure you'll be happy with him.
I gave him my consent and I hope you'll do likewise.
- But, father, I don't know him.
- The wedding's in a month. 
Now go.
My son is happy.
My husband is unhappy.
My place is beside my husband.
Marie!
What will happen to father, Marie?
What have we done to deserve all this?
I will curse you, if you don't come back in a year.
Come back soon!
We all will be waiting for you, Masha!
She has shed not one tear.
She's the most remarkable woman I've ever known.
Why not retire and enjoy the family life, raising children?
Dear Serge!
I haven't seen the Emperor for a while, and I must admit that my feelings toward him have changed.
Should you see him, tell him the princess remembers him.
You got more cheerful, dear cousin.
When you arrived in Italy, you looked so sad.
Russian women don't like to travel.
The Russian woman's attachment to her home is unequaled.
The hot springs of Italy did you a lot of good.
You won't believe me, but the doctor has been so reassuring.
If we're to believe him, it won't be a year before I can give Sergey a little angel.
I'll pray for you.
...Tomorrow, my dear guest, you must hear his opera.
Did you want to see me?
Here I am!
- I hope I didn't disturb you?
- No, I've finished already.
Don't forget: tonight we're invited to the duchess.
Why sit here for no purpose?
He is not at home!
Whenever His Excellency gets ill, he stays at his doctor's.
Getting all kinds of rubbings-in and poultices. 
He can't travel after that.
He must be staying overnight there, or he would've been here already.
You shouldn't have waited, Your Excellency, it's night already.
Montesquieu. "Persian Letters".
I would have brought it to you.
Please!
Too bad I couldn't receive you again.
I'm not well, I only got up because of an urgent matter.
Besides, as you know, the Emperor's answer hasn't yet...
All right... all right...
I have no good news for you, Princess.
If I'm not mistaken, this is your tenth visit here, isn't it?
Excuse me, the eleventh.
You see?
.
Where's my letter, General?
Where's the paper I signed?
- Couldn't the answer get mislaid?
- Oh, no, the courier...
You see?
God knows I didn't want to bother the Empress.
Pafnuti!
- The paper?
- Waiting, as you said.
Send it this week.
No, next week.
Shall I send it on Tuesday?
Friday.
Friday will be just right.
It will be just right on Friday.
Yes, yes, yes...
Friday is just right.
Or take the varieties of Little Russia...
Or rennet, for example...
This was planted exactly in the year that Masha was born.
What did my sister's nail mark here?
It's better to doubt nobility than virtuousness.
A coal-miner's wife deserves more respect than a prince's mistress.
How did you like the prince?
You aren't matchmaking for me, dear brother, or are you?
Well, Prince Volkonsky is one of the best eligible bachelors in Russia.
Maybe I'd better wait for a more modest suitor. 
Why hurry?
I'd sooner run away than become the wife of a titled dandy.
Grief's constant sister...
Grief's constant sister...
Hope is high...
Hope...
Hope...
Hope.
Doesn't he love his Fatherland who makes sacrifices for his convictions, who is ready to mount the scaffold for them?
Doesn't he command respect for the only reason that he ventured a new cause before its time came?
Let's go, Your Excellency.
Get in, be so kind.
Your Excellency!
I was ordered to overtake Your Excellency.
A message from St. Petersburg.
Will you read it, please?
The wife of a state criminal is not to leave the place of exile before her husband dies.
Even after his death, the government takes no obligation to permit the widows of criminals to return to Russia.
Thank you.
Now tell me, how far is Yekaterinburg?
Two hundred versts, Your Excellency.
How come, Your Excellency?
Wait, I'll announce you.
But I don't know if he'll receive you.
Dear sir, you have received the answer last week.
Stop your evasions!
You know about the letter as well as I do.
Really, Princess?
But I haven't read it yet.
Too bad, I didn't have the time.
Then read it, dear sir!
Certainly I will read it.
But I receive a lot of mail from His Majesty which concerns not only you.
- Maybe in a week...
- Sir!
You've been keeping me waiting for almost six months!
Well, as you wish. 
Pafnuti!
You may read it.
At least read what's required of you.
I don't care, and you know it.
You're wrong.
You're very wrong, Princess.
A wife, following her husband, will share his fate and lose her former title of any rank, that is, will be recognized as no other than an exiled convict's wife.
At the same time, she agrees to take any distress that such a position may involve, namely:
children that may be begotten in Siberia will be enlisted as factory peasants... with no right of inheriting either the property or name of their father, for they will be registered as serfs.
You shouldn't have tortured yourself so.
Had you listened to me in the first place, you would've been home now.
And your parents wouldn't have pined for their daughter.
Is that all?
Can I go to my husband now?
Be so kind as to make arrangements for the horses.
Have you ever seen convicts in irons?
Answer me!
Why are you shouting?
Who gave you that right?
You gave it to me!
You're the wife of an exiled convict.
You yourself will be sent to Nerchinsk as a convict.
With your hands and feet in irons.
You will go with a group of convicts under convoy.
You will be tied up with the rest, as villains are, so that... they don't escape.
And one more thing: out of 500 men we send under convoy, no more than a third get to Nerchinsk alive.
Well?
Are you still willing?
I don't care, I just want to go.
Tell them to bring irons.
You will go, you will go...
I don't want to, I can't torture you anymore. 
I'm sorry, Princess.
I had been pressured to dissuade you by all possible means.
I just tried to scare you. 
I'll give you the horses, and may God save you.
The winter of 1826-1827 dragged on and on at the Blagodatsk mine.
No, no, let's go there.
You don't deserve the leniency you're accorded.
Leniency?
Using you in the works is a leniency to your sin.
You must prove your obedience by modesty and good behaviour.
I'm not well, and you know it, my good man.
Did you come here to take treatments?
Stand up when you're spoken to!
There, we're awake.
My dear Alyonka is awake!
Now we'll eat, we'll eat...
My Goodness!
Your cheeks have frozen!
Now, have patience, mistress.
At last we're in the Promised Land.
Halt! 
Where are you going?
No one is to go in here.
Is Prince Volkonsky kept here?
There're no princes here, only convicts.
I have covered 7,000 versts to see my husband.
Run fast!
I pray the commandant wouldn't come here.
Oh, God! 
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!
A year later. 
Spring, 1828...
Do you, Praskovya, take this loann, whom you see in front of you, as your husband, of your good and unconstrained will and firm conviction?
Mademoiselle Gebl, do you take Jean to be your husband?
Yes!
Come what may!
My congratulations, Madame!
Hurry up!
Where are you taking him, the poor man?
I forgot to tell you...
I want you to know...
Stand back!
How dare you speak not Russian?
I don't understand...
You pledged yourself to speak only Russian!
Stand back! 
Are you deaf or what?
Don't dare!
I'll kill you! 
Don't dare!
Don't dare touch her!
Scoundrels!
Bastards!
Onward, the Fatherland's sons!
Shut up!
Our hour of glory is coming!
We're against tyranny!
I told you, shut up!
It does you no honour.
Restrain your heroes, General.
Stop it!
Madame, tell me everything you wanted to say and I'll pass it on to your husband in the language which is prescribed.
I wanted to say, General, that I'm very happy.
Your wife asked me to tell you that she's absolutely happy.
Go!
The End

(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
Here!
No!
(DOOR OPENS)
GREG: 
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
I was wrong, Jeannie.
I thought you were the kind that survived just to spite me.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(GASPS)
Oh!
(COUGHING)
You have to help me, please!
(SOBBING) I can't do anything by myself.
The tractor went over, he's pinned underneath and I can't get him free.
Come with me, please. 
Please!
-Where is he?
-At the quarry.
I tried to pull him free but I couldn't move him.
It's on top of his legs.
He's in terrible pain.
You'd better get in.
What happened exactly?
We'd unhitched the trailer and he was turning the tractor.
Went over on its side.
-He's unconscious.
-That's probably just as well.
It's lifting clear.
Yeah, but I need another couple of inches.
Put your arms underneath his shoulders and just try and gently ease him out.
Just pull him gently.
Here we are.
(PANTING)
ANNE: 
Can we get him to the hut?
Well, we'll just have to.
Just grab hold of his feet.
As gentle as you can.
All right.
Have you got some sort of drug amongst this lot? 
Some kind of painkiller?
Have you got some brandy, then? 
Whisky?
In the trailer.
We got some on the last trip.
Yeah, would you get it?
'Cause he'll need something.
He's gonna be in a lot of pain.
And scissors? 
You got any scissors?
(BOTTLE BREAKS)
Is it very bad?
Yeah, well, legs are broken, bones smashed.
God knows what we'll do about it.
Splints or something.
Well, you bind on splints, don't you?
I don't know anything about first aid.
Well, he's needs a damn sight more than first aid.
I mean, his bones have got to be reset.
Properly.
And I don't know how to do it. 
Do you?
Well, whatever we're gonna do, we better do it while he's still unconscious.
Because when he wakes up, he's gonna be in agony.
I could do with some of this myself.
-There are some cups somewhere.
-Oh, it doesn't matter.
Your family dead?
My father. 
Roger, my brother.
I had two days when I felt awful.
Daddy had sent the servants away, so there was nobody.
Then I felt a bit better and got downstairs.
Can you open this? 
It's a bit tight.
Do you know, I'd never seen a dead person before.
(COUGHS)
(GIGGLES)
It's warm.
Champagne's disgusting when it's warm.
How about you?
My wife died.
I'm sorry.
-Were you with her?
-No, I was in Holland.
Well, I'm an engineer.
I was working on land reclamation.
-Was it bad there?
-Well, it was slow at first.
Just a few people sick, we all thought it was some kind of influenza bug, but then people started dying, and all in a rush,
I mean, hundreds of them.
Nothing happened to me. 
I was all right.
Same for him. 
He wasn't touched by it.
He told me everybody he knew had died, and he wasn't even touched by it.
-How did you get back?
-Company helicopter.
Rotterdam was burning, just miles and miles of fire.
Oil tanks going off like bombs.
Oh, I'd never seen anything like it in my life.
And I came down the coast as far as Calais and...
All the way down I saw nothing, no people, no traffic.
When I stopped at Ostend to get some fuel, that was the only place that I saw anybody.
Just a man and two children.
I tried to talk to them but they just kept moving away, wouldn't let me near them.
Well, I suppose they thought I was carrying the disease.
Then I waited for a day and a night for the weather to calm down.
Then I came across the Channel.
Where were you going when I stopped you?
Nowhere.
Just driving.
(GROANING)
Now, well, if we're gonna do something about putting splints on him,
I suppose we'd better make a start.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(HORN HONKING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
What do you want?
Keep away from this car, it's mine.
You're the first person I've seen.
The first one for days!
Yeah. 
Well, I've seen people.
They haven't seen me, though.
I'm keeping away from them.
I don't want their germs, see.
And that goes for you.
Clear off. 
Just clear off!
I've seen you before.
You were on the hill.
You had a sort of shelter.
-I talked to you!
-Oh, I remember.
Yeah. 
Well, it's like I told you then.
Stay away from people, you'll be all right.
Just keep away from everybody until the doctors clear it up.
For pity's sake! 
Don't you understand?
There aren't any doctors.
They died along with everybody else.
There isn't anybody left to get it cleared up!
That's only here!
The Yanks have something, don't worry.
In the war, they gave us the stuff then.
The Yanks'll fix us up. 
Don't worry.
Take me with you.
(CAR STARTING)
I don't want to be by myself any more.
Please! 
Please!
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
That's about as much as I can do.
God knows if it's gonna do you any good.
It hurts like hell!
Yeah, I know it does.
I'm sorry.
I just don't see what else I can do.
You need proper attention.
(PANTING)
You want one of these?
Is he going to get better?
I don't know.
Unless the bones are set properly, he'll be crippled for life.
He might be able to get around on crutches or something.
I just don't know.
It's going to be like this from now on, isn't it?
-Like what?
-Accidents!
Even little things.
A bad cut, burns.
Almost anything, they'll be really serious.
God help us if we get something as simple as toothache.
-How long do you think?
-Mmm?
I mean, how long before things start to get back to normal.
Normal? 
Never.
Not in our or several other lifetimes.
That's what he thinks, too.
It's gonna be very tough.
I suppose it could be.
For some.
What do you mean?
There's an abundance of everything.
Living may not be gracious, but it can be comfortable.
One way or another, I'm gonna make damn sure
I get my full share of everything that's going.
ABBY: 
Anybody there?
Hello?
Who's there?
ARTHUR: 
Stay where you are.
-What do you want?
-I saw the lights.
-You're on your own?
-Yes.
I saw the lights and I thought there might be somebody up here.
-I just came to see.
-You're not sick?
-Not got the sickness?
-No.
I was. 
I did have the disease but I'm all right.
ARTHUR: 
No. 
Stand where you are.
Now, what do you want?
Look, I told you. 
I saw the lights.
God knows, there are few enough of us left.
I haven't seen or spoken to anyone for the best part of a week.
-Look, if you want me to go, I'll go.
-Sure you're on your own?
Oh, for God's sake!
Just let me get in my car and I'll go.
All right, Dave. 
Switch the lights on.
I'm sorry about that.
Can't be too careful.
Had a little trouble earlier.
Well, will you come in?
I don't want my battery to go flat.
Will you turn off the lights?
It's all right, Dave. 
Nobody with her.
Oh, uh, this is Dave. 
Dave Long.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Arthur Wormley.
-Abby Grant.
Well, I'll take your coat.
Well, come on through.
We're in the kitchen.
We were just preparing something to eat when we heard your car.
Come on through.
(POT BUBBLING)
-Well, this is nice. 
Everything working?
-Oh, yes.
Stoves works off cylinder gas.
Generator for the electricity.
There's even water, pumped up out of the well.
You're very lucky.
Yes, yes. 
There can't be many places that are totally independent of outside services.
Oh, uh, would you like a drink?
We've got almost everything.
I'd love one. 
Vodka?
Yeah. 
Dave.
Anything with it? 
Bitter lemon, tonic?
Tonic, please.
Ice?
(CHUCKLING) Yes, please.
It all seems so normal.
Well, that's it, isn't it? 
That's it.
That's all we got to get back to, quick as we can. 
Back to normal.
Oh, you'll stay and have something to eat?
We're not the greatest cooks in the world but you're welcome to anything we've got.
Thank you.
I'll just have a look at the stove.
-Thank you.
-It won't be too long.
Thanks, Dave.
Now... 
Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have seen you before.
I'm sure we've never met but I've seen you before.
Well, it's likely. 
My picture's been in the papers enough times.
Arthur Wormley, of course.
The union man. 
Chairman, wasn't it?
Well, national president. 
I was.
There's nothing to be president of.
Well, not at the moment, anyway.
You must have been in close contact with government circles.
I mean, you must have been quite well informed when all this started.
Oh, just at the beginning.
Of course, they'd called an emergency meeting.
But everything happened so fast.
They issued some orders to the army, put up roadblocks, stopped people leaving the cities, but it's damn silly, really.
Finally they had to declare martial law, which meant that under certain circumstances the authorities could open fire to protect property or life.
That's awful.
Well, did it happen? 
Was there shooting?
Oh, I think so, during the first panic weeks.
After that, there weren't enough fit people to carry out the orders.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, come to that, there weren't enough people moving about to cause trouble.
So, there's no authority now. 
Nothing?
Well, not as such. 
Not yet.
But there will be.
There's armed people moving around all over the country.
Aimless. 
Lost.
They'll make contact with each other.
Start forming into groups.
Somebody's got to unite those groups.
Bring them under central control.
They'll want leadership, guidance.
They'll want somebody in authority.
Now, under the circumstances, it's up to somebody to assume that responsibility.
It's up to somebody to take the power to lead.
I'm not a church-going man.
Never one for religion.
I think God might have spared me to help those of us that are left.
That's my skill. 
That's my talent.
Organisation.
I think it's about ready.
Oh, good, good. 
I'm starving.
Well, bring it out then, Dave.
That looks marvellous.
Out of the deep freeze.
There must be enough for 10 there.
Would you like to wash up in the cloak room while we get this out?
-Oh, yes please.
-Okay.
I'll show you where it is.
-Second door on the left.
-Thank you.
Carve as much as we need, Dave, and take the rest out to them.
We'll have to get some more beds tomorrow.
There are plenty in the warehouse where we got that one.
We'll just have to make do for tonight.
There are plenty of blankets and pillows.
I'll make out a list in the morning.
Books. 
I'd like to get a lot of books.
It's going to be a long, dull winter with just the three of us.
Yeah, well. 
Look, Anne...
You two have got things pretty well set up here.
-Yes, it's not bad.
-But it's just...
Vic chose it. 
He said it was isolated and easy to defend.
He was going to bring some more of these portable huts down here on the trailer, so we'd have some storage space.
(GROANING)
Do you think you could get the tractor back on its wheels?
-Yeah, I expect so.
-Good.
Vic said we should go out every day and get things.
Right through the winter if needs be.
He said we should collect everything we could lay hands on.
-Yeah, that's a good idea.
-Yes.
Then later on, we might be able to find some people who'd be willing to work for us.
They could grow vegetables and things like that.
And we could pay them with food, goods, clothing. 
Things like that.
-Was that Vic's idea, too?
-No, I thought of that.
I don't think we're going to be too badly off.
You see, from now on money isn't going to mean anything.
The rich will be the ones who've got things
I'm sure there'll be plenty of people who'd be glad to work for a good meal or a warm coat or something.
Oh, yeah. 
They'll be queuing up.
Yes. 
In those terms, I'm sure we'll be quite well-to-do.
I going to have to get some sleep.
There's some blankets over there somewhere.
Yes, I went to the school.
But the master had taken some of the boys away.
Peter was one of them.
I don't know where they went.
Well, I hope you find him.
We'll need all the youngsters.
I might be able to help you later.
Oh, there must be a lot of people that had got separated.
As we contact the survivors, I hope to make a list of their names.
Where they're going, what they're doing.
I want to make this a sort of a clearing centre for information.
It's a marvellous idea.
It's something that'll be badly needed.
Well, we have to do what we can.
Now, what about you?
What about your plans?
Well, finding Peter is the most important thing, of course.
But at the same time, I'm looking for a place.
Somewhere to start a home.
A farm. 
A settlement, really.
You see, I think, we're going to have to start again.
Right from the beginning.
We're going to have to relearn all the old crafts.
Oh, I don't just mean growing food, and God knows, that's going to be hard enough.
But all the other things that we've forgotten.
Aren't you going to use anything that's left over?
Well, of course I will. 
I'll have to.
But the aim is to become more and more self-reliant.
To depend less on what's been left behind.
You're not making it easy for yourself, are you?
I mean, I agree with you about growing food, but the hardware of civilisation will last for a long time yet.
Of course it will. 
But not forever.
Don't you see the point we'd reached in our civilisation?
Now, look around you. 
Anywhere you like.
In this house, in this room.
I doubt if it contains a single artefact that was the exclusive creation of one person.
Well, this table.
This simple wooden table.
Well, I'm no carpenter, but I reckon
I could knock up something like this.
Right from scratch?
You'd fell the timber? 
With what?
An axe or a saw.
The steel for the saw has been made in a foundry, the iron ore has been dug from the ground, and the fuel to smelt it with has been mined.
Now, what happens when the last axe head cracks and the last saw breaks?
This simple metal knife is the product of hundreds of people in dozens of different trades.
And take anything else you like, anywhere you like, and the same will be true of it.
How do you make a cup?
A piece of paper? 
Glass?
Our civilisation had the technology to land a man on the moon.
But as individuals we don't even have the skill to make an iron spearhead.
We are less practical than Iron Age man.
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. 
It's just that I've thought about it a lot.
And with nobody to talk to, I haven't been able to say it out loud.
No, I'm glad you did.
You've thought about more deeply than I have so far.
And I'm sure that you're right.
You won't be able to start this settlement on your own.
No.
But I'm hoping there'll be other people who'll think the same way.
Oh, there will. 
It's a first-class idea.
And when you start at this commune of yours...
-Well, that's where I can help.
-In what way?
By making sure that you can get on with it without being interfered with by outsiders.
By bringing some law and order.
We've got to back to the rudiments of government.
Yours won't be the only settlement.
I should have thought it would have been a long time before we needed any sort of national administration.
Oh, believe me, it can't be too soon.
We've already started in a little way.
Locating food dumps.
Making sure that everything is shared out.
So one man doesn't corner the market.
If the distribution is handled from here, nobody will go without.
I'll make sure of that.
Oh, the beginnings will be small.
Perhaps just this area.
But as we grow stronger, we'll spread out, expand.
That's how the old feudal barons operated, wasn't it?
Perhaps.
But it's the way that ultimately led to the finest democratic system in the world.
I suppose.
It's just that I hadn't seen a political system as being one of our priorities.
Well, that's where you're wrong.
There's little groups forming already, trying to take over.
I told you earlier we'd had a spot of trouble.
Started the day we took this place over.
It's not your house?
No. 
We needed a headquarters.
That evening, a rat pack of toughs came marching up, led by an ex-army chap.
Called himself a colonel.
Said they were a vigilante force of citizens.
I offered them to join up.
It couldn't have been fairer.
Do you know what these army chaps are?
They won't let go one scrap of authority they've managed to grab.
He started raiding.
The last attack came just before you...
You arrived.
I gave them a taste of their own medicine.
They won't be back in a hurry.
Anyway, that's all over now.
Would you like a brandy?
No. 
No, thank you.
Well, uh, you're going to go on tonight or would you like a bed here?
There's plenty of room.
You must be tired with all that time on the road.
There is one thing I'd appreciate.
I noticed you had hot water.
A bath would be the greatest luxury that I can think of.
All the hot water you want.
All the hot water in the world.
I'll show you where it is.
(COUGHING)
(GASPS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(MEN YELLING)
Get them all?
There's three round the back, another one down by the road.
-Well, where's Phil?
-Oh, he's had it.
ABBY: 
Mr Wormley, I...
Go back, Mrs Grant.
We have assumed authority to maintain law and order in this area.
By what right?
The government announcement of a state of emergency and the introduction of martial law provides all the powers necessary to protect life and property.
Those powers are vested only in the recognised authorities
-of the services and the police.
-You are guilty.
You are guilty of leading an armed attack against peaceful citizens.
Peaceful citizens...
You have caused the death of a man carrying out his duty in defending this area.
Now, you men. 
Listen to me.
Having taken responsibility for this area, it is my duty, to administer such laws as are for the general welfare.
This man has committed murder.
We are completely within our legal right to pass judgement on him.
Not only our right, but our duty.
Now, is that clearly understood?
(MEN ASSENTING)
By the authority vested, in a declared state of martial law, the penalty for murder is death.
You will be executed.
The sentence will be carried out immediately.
All right. 
Take him away.
(SOBBING) This isn't right.
This isn't right!
No!
No, you have no right to do that!
You can't do that!
They're an armed gang trying to attack this house.
His execution is perfectly legal.
But you're murdering him!
Mrs Grant, we will never get back to any law and order while men like him are allowed to grab power.
(GUN FIRING)
Good luck with your settlement, Mrs Grant.
I warn you, without people like us to lead and protect you, you'll never get anywhere.
(CAR ENGINE TRYING TO START)
-Where are you going?
-I don't know. 
I'm not sure.
You're coming back though?
You will come back?
No.
But you can't go. 
You can't just go.
What about me?
I'm sorry. 
You'll just have to look out for yourself.
I can't! 
I can't manage on my own.
Look, if I can find dome drugs, some medicines, something that'll help him, then I'll come back.
But I'm not promising anything and even if I do, I'm not staying.
You've no right to leave me!
Get out of that car. 
Get out!
Anne.
Get me something to drink.
Shut up.
Shut up! 
Shut up!
(COUGHING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Where are you going?
You can't leave me on my own.
Stay here. 
Anne!
Please!
Don't go!
I don't have any definite plans at the moment.
Just drive around for a while, I suppose. 
See what's happening.
How about you?
I just want to be with people.
I thought I could manage. 
I've always been an independent sort of person.
But the last week...
The loneliness was more than I could bear. 
It was awful.
Yes. 
Well, I expect people to be starting to form up in small groups by now.
We'll find somebody for you.
Will you stay, if we do?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll take these pills and drugs and things down to the quarry.
After that, I think I'll just take it as it comes.
I've got the things you need.
They're in the boot.
I'll get them for you.
He's dead.
You'd better get in the car.
(CAR DRIVING AWAY)
Help me!
Anne!
Help me!
There's sure to be a petrol station somewhere nearby.
Ah, it's probably better to pick up another car with a full tank.
Anyway, there's no point in staying here.
Just grab your things.
It'll be dark soon.
There's no point in staying around.
May as well find a place to spend the night.
Come on.
(COUGHING)
Greg. 
Greg, look!
Let's find where it's coming from.
There must be people there.
It's hard to tell how far away it is.
I'm going there.
-What, now?
-Yes.
It's a signal, they must want people to see.
All right.
Anne.
Anne, come on, wake up.
We're moving out.
Leave me alone.
Come on, Anne. 
Please!
I'm cold! 
Leave me alone.
Look, Anne, it's up to you.
But we're going.
And if there's anybody there, we'll come back and pick you up tomorrow.
(FIRE CRACKLING)
I saw the fire.
I hoped somebody would.
You're the first.
Will there be others?

Where's Bob?
He called this meeting for 9:00.
- It's already 10 after.
- A shrink has no sense of time.
They're not really doctors. 
They don't deal with life and death like we do.
Listen, I've got a society nose job waiting in my office.
Hold it, Phil We should wait.
Bob said it was a personal matter.
- Probably needs our advice.
- Well, when he gets here... tell him my advice is to forget it, because when a marriage is over, it's over.
There's nothing wrong with his marriage.
If there was, he wouldn't come to you.
He'd come to me.
- Oh, really? 
What else could it be?
- Money.
I asked him to lend me a nickel for the parking meter yesterday... the man claimed he didn't have change.
Come to think of it, he's done that to me a lot.
Mm-hmm. 
Bob's broke.
That's not it. 
I borrow money from him all the time.
Well, then it can only be one thing- he is sick.
You know, come to think of it, he has looked a little pasty lately.
God, his marriage is over, he's broke, and he's gonna die.
Not his week.
There's someone outside to see Jerry.
- Who are you?
- I'm Gail.
- Where's Carol?
- She's on vacation.
Again? 
That's twice in two years.
Well, broads are all alike.
I object to the term "broads"
- I am a woman.
- Not really.
I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Look, I've been here before.
I can handle everything.
- Now, which one of you is Jerry?
- Me.
Okay, fine. 
What do I tell the person waiting outside to see you?
Look, whatever your name is, we are having a meeting here.
My best friend is in trouble!
- Who's out there?
- I don't know. 
Some girl.
Really? 
Well, I'll see you later.
- Pardon me, Gail. 
Is that your name?
- Yeah.
Just, how well do you know Carol?
Pretty well.
Did she ever tell you anything personal about Bob?
He doesn't pay her enough.
But she likes him anyway.
Bob called us here because something horrible is happening in his life.
And we wanna know what it is.
Well, I guess Carol should be the one to tell you this... but I understand that during a full moon...
Bob has a tendency to chase cars.
Maybe we should call in a vet.
Oh, hi. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I didn't have any change for the meter.
- I had to park on a side street.
- I knew it. 
You're broke.
Oh, no, he isn't.
Look at the man's complexion. 
He is sick.
You'd look sick too if your marriage was going down the tubes.
Is this my fear of sanity group?
Look, Bob, we were sort of speculating... on what's wrong with you, and obviously something is.
Nothing's wrong. 
I just wanted to talk to you about my sister.
- She's broke.
- She's sick.
Her marriage is down the tubes.
- Will you let me tell you?
- Well, Bob, get to it.
- We are doctors.
- All right. 
She-
She wants to do an article about us, and her editor gave approval.
I just wanted to know how you feel about it.
- Well, I hate it.
- And I love it.
- Why?
- Because you hate it.
Let me get this straight.
Your sister wants to do an article on a day in the life of a medical building.
Exactly.
Oh, that's perfect. 
She can talk to Dr. Harris, an adequate G.P.
Jerry, an average orthodontist.
And of course, Bob, a competent psychologist. 
And myself.
The Michelangelo of grotesque deformity... battling the plague and the scourge... epidemics of crippling ugliness.
And then there's Bernie for comic relief.
I resent that. 
Urology is an honorable profession.
Look, all I need is yes or no.
- Yes.
- It's okay by me.
- Well, me too. 
Except for one thing, okay?
- What's that?
I don't want anybody to tell her what I do.
I thought it was an honorable profession.
Well, that's no reason to shout it from the rooftops.
Nobody cares what you do, Bernie.
I'm sorry I'm late, Bob.
But that was important.
I had to interview a dental cleavage-technician.
That's all right, Jerry.
The meetings over.
So, what's the problem? 
Boy, you should've heard them talking before you got here.
They figured it could be only three things- either you're bankrupt... getting a divorce or dying.
Can you lend me 10 bucks?
- Yeah, sure, Jerry.
- Ten-spot.
Thanks. 
How's, everything going between you and Emily?
Fine.
- More coffee anyone?
- Yeah, I'll have some.
- More muffins too if you've got them.
- Happen to have them here, Morty.
- Can I have another, cup of coffee?
- Sure, dear.
Second cup of coffee.
- What did you just write down?
- Oh, it's not important.
Listen, Bob, I just want you to ignore me today.
I mean, forget that I'm your sister.
I'm a reporter.
- And you're a shrink.
- I'm back!
Come in, Howard.
It's open.
Ow!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, except for my knee and my- my shoulder and my forehead.
Yeah, but I don't wanna ruin your day.
I've learned to live with pain.
Would you like some bacon and eggs, Howard?
No, thank you. 
I'm in too much pain.
I'll have some- some toast though.
I'll have his eggs.
Who's he?
Oh, Howard, I'd like you to meet my photographer, Morty.
Oh, glad to meet you.
You guys do a real great job, you know.
I mean, without pictures in newspapers, newspapers would just be news.
- Honey, can I see you in the kitchen?
- Sure.
I was talking to Bob.
Oh, I'm sorry. 
When Ellen says "honey," she usually means me.
You know what I heard once?
A picture's worth a thousand words.
Would you pass the butter?
You know, Bob, if you're gonna have your picture taken today...
I don't think you ough to wear that tie.
Why not?
Ellen gave it to me.
She must've given it to you as a joke.
The reason you think it's a joke is because it's daytime.
I mean, at night, it glows in the dark.
Testing.
Testing. 
Testing.
You hear that? 
Why does everyone always say "testing, testing" when they're testing?
- Jelly.
- Well, I gotta go.
I've gotta go soaring off into the sunrise.
It's my job, soaring.
Are you gonna eat your toast?
No, no. 
Thank you.
Nice talking to you, Morty.
Well, it was a thrill for me too.
- I guess I'll go too.
- I hope everything goes well today.
Thanks. 
I'll ask him my first probing question on the way out.
Shoot.
You're not really gonna wear that tie, are ya?
Oh, come on, Morty.
We're leaving.
- You go ahead without me. 
I'll grab a cab.
- Morty!
- Oh, all right.
- Did you have enough to eat, Morty?
No, but we'll break for lunch early.
- Hi, Phil.
- I beg your pardon?
- "Hi, Phil." 
- It's Dr. Newman.
Let's conduct ourselves with a little decorum today. 
After all, this is press day.
- When will Carol be back?
- Soon, I hope.
This place is a snake pit.
Ah. 
Well, well, good morning, doctors.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
Sure, but try calling one in the middle of the night.
Oh, good morning, doctors.
Doctor, when do you think the press will get here?
Well, Doctor, I hope very soon... otherwise they're gonna have to vacuum your head again.
I wore this before at the last Christmas party.
Oh, that's right. 
You were doing the Mexican hat dance... and it fell on the floor, and everybody thought it was a tarantula.
Oh, look who's talking. 
I noticed you used a little eyebrow pencil this morning.
You're full of it, Doctor.
Some days his eyebrows just happen to be darker than others.
Well, if you'll excuse me, doctors. 
I have some important doctor stuff to take care of.
Got to fix my spit sink.
Well, good morning, Doctor.
And this must be your sister, Ellen.
How do you do?
I am Dr. Newman.
- I know. 
Hi, Phil.
- Oh.
Welcome, welcome, to the Rimpau Medical Arts Building.
Oh, well, thank you.
You mind if we get off the elevator?
Oh, certainly. 
Certainly.
And if there's... anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable... you just talk to Dr. Tupperman.
He's the little fella here with the tarantula on his head.
Oh, my God, Bernie.
What are you wearing?
Come on, Bob.
You've seen this jacket before.
Does anybody know how to load this thing?
- I can take a look at it.
- Oh, thanks, Bob.
Is there a coffee shop around here?
- Yeah, downstairs.
- Oh, fine.
Call me when you get it loaded.
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
Morty, you just ate a half an hour ago.
Oh, no wonder I'm so hungry.
Well, I guess I'll tape some interviews and have some pictures taken later.
Well, why not, start with plastic surgery?
Why don't we mosey on down to the face-lift factory.
You could start with me.
- My field is just as interesting as his.
- What is your field?
I'd rather not say.
Why don't we let her start where she wants to start.
I'm in 713.
I thought that office was abandoned.
There are more patients coming into my office than any other office in this building.
Never saw one come out.
Phil, take a hike.
Well, I have to go to makeup- I mean, to work.
Work. 
I have to, work.
I work down here.
Well, I guess I'll be going too.
Oh, Gail-
If the White House physician comes by with that specimen... be sure to buzz me, will you?
I wanna go home.
Well, Morty's camera is all loaded.
Why don't you come down to coffee shop with me and show him how to work it?
That's not a bad idea.
I'm starved.
Morty ate my breakfast.
Gail, can we bring you anything back?
Yeah, if you see a jelly doughnut.
Oh, and if we, see a Secret Service man with a bottle... we'll send him right up here.
What's going on?
I used to do divorce work.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Ellen, is that you?
Yeah. 
Listen, do you mind if I interview you first?
- No. 
No, go right ahead.
- Ah, terrific.
Ellen Hartley, Rimpau Medical Arts interview... with Dr. Jerry Robinson, orthodontist.
All right, first of all, Dr. Robinson, what is orthodontia?
What is orthodontia?
What is life?
I asked you first.
What is orthodontia?
Well, let's begin by saying... that it's not just fixing kids' teeth.
It's hard work, it's sweat, and, yes... a certain amount of spit.
- So, life is like spit?
- Exactly.
I wish I had a wider-angle lens.
Part of your nose is out of the frame.
Dr. Robinson, here's your m-
Well, what a surprise.
Ellen. 
You know... doctors do little favors like this for each other all the time.
It's called professional courtesy.
It's part of the Hippocr- the Hipp- 
- You know, that oath that we all swear by.
- The Hippocratic oath?
That could be.
Well, Phil.
I'm interviewing, Jerry right now.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I'll just get out of your way.
I won't bother you a bit.
All right, Jerry. 
How do you determine when a kid needs braces?
When his parents can come up with a couple of grand to pay for them.
- Will you butt out, Phil?
- Dr. Robin-
Gee, I'm awful sorry.
I didn't know that you had company.
I don't. 
Company is something that you invite.
Well, Jerry, remember that time you asked me about the history of urology?
- No.
- Well, I've done some research.
Napoleon had a urologist following him through every campaign.
Following? 
You mean leading.
And did you know that nonspecific "uritis"... claimed the lives of 15 Egyptian pharaohs?
I heard it was 14.
Tupperman, I didn't ask you about any of this stuff.
Well, maybe there's somebody in the room... from the news media who might be interested.
Oh, I am, Dr. Tupperman.
But not right now.
You know, the phones are all ringing off their hooks out there... but they're only patients, so I suppose it doesn't really matter.
What's the matter with you guys?
This is a working day.
Jerry, that girl is back. 
She said you were supposed to interview her at 10:00.
- That's tonight.
- She's early.
Hi! 
Nice to see you again.
Step into my, office.
Well, Ellen, it looks like we're gonna have a chance to talk.
What is it you'd like to know?
Excuse me.
I have to file some X-rays.
- Thank you.
- I am not only after one thing.
Have you seen my Phi Beta Kappa key?
I seem to have misplaced it.
No, I didn't spike your drink.
Is this Jerry Robinson's office?
Over here.
Jerry, there's a guy here to fix your spit sink.
Will you show him where it is, please?
I don't think you can get there from here.
Is this Candid Camera?
Are you Allen Funt?
Okay, let's have a nice, big group smile.
Hi, everybody.
Ellen, I'm glad I found you.
You left your comb in the apartment.
I thought you might need it.
Oh! 
My hand's stuck!
I wanna thank all of you for your cooperation. 
Come on, Morty.
Let's get something to eat.
I'm starved.
Hold on, Ellen. 
There's something you should know about warts.
It was 15 Egyptian pharaohs.
I can prove it.
I can't find my Nobel Peace Prize either.
That's, very nice of you to bring the comb.
- Well, I thought it might be important.
- Yeah.
If I were Carol, I'd go on vacation every week.
What are you, like a dentist?
- Orthodontist.
- What's that?
Orthodontia?
Well, it's a lot like life- hard work, sweat and, yes... a certain amount of spit.
I can see that.
You understand it's just a first draft.
I'm sure it's fine.
I mean, they'll be a lot of changes in it before it appears in print.
I can't read it with you looking over my shoulder.
Well, I just wanted to know what you think.
So far, it seems okay to me, except...
"Hartley" is spelled L-E-Y.
- How'd I spell it?
- L-Y.
- I did not!
- You misspelled it every time.
Well, it's my name too.
I can spell it whatever way I want to.
- How come I'm not mentioned?
- You are.
- Where is it?
- Right there.
- Where?
- Oh, yeah.
"Dr. Hartley is married."
Well, I am married.
I had Gail run off some copies for the other doctors.
- You, will let me know what they think?
- Yeah.
- Let's go. 
I'm starving.
- You sound like Morty.
- See ya later, Bob.
- See, it's right there on the door.
L
- E-Y.
Ellen, I just finished the article, and I think it is brilliant.
- It's... really honest.
- Gee, thanks, Gail.
Would you guys mind if I joined you for lunch?
- Sure. 
Come on.
- Thank you.
I, don't think I wanna be here when the doctors read the article.
Can I, buy anybody a sarsaparilla?
We read the article, Bob.
Oh. 
Oh, great. 
The, copies came out clear, huh?
- Very clear.
- Great. 
Great.
Beause, you know, sometimes they come out a little blurry.
I mean, usually they don't.
You know, I guess this time- is one of the times that they came out clear.
It's a real good copying machine.
We were-
We were real smart to invest in it.
You guys mad or something?
Mad? 
Why should we be mad?
Just because your sister made us look like a bunch of quacks?
She called me "a Hippocratic oaf."
She called me "portly and diminutive."
Where did she come off telling my age?
Said I spent the whole day trying to straighten out my love life.
It's not straightened out.
- Nobody came off well.
- Yeah, well, you did, Bob.
Sure, why not?
He's her brother.
She misspelled my name.
I don't want my mother to see this article.
But I want my lawyer to see it.
This thing better be changed before it goes to press, Bob.
Change it, or you'll rue the clay you rented space in this building.
Look, Ellen wrote that the way she saw it.
And, I'm not gonna ask her to change it.
And I'd be disappointed in her if she did.
You know what I think, Bob? 
I don't think you're man enough to stand up to her.
I think you're yellow.
You bushwhacked us, Bob.
You've got till sundown to have this article changed.
Bernie!
They went thataway.
It seems like Howard's been at that all-night newsstand all night.
Oh, he's so cute.
He's like an expectant father.
I just wish he'd get here.
Ellen, take it easy. 
You wrote the article. 
You know what's in it.
Oh, I know, Bob. 
But-You know, it's different when you see it in print... with all the spelling corrected.
You know, actually there is-
There is something I meant to talk to you about now that you've... you know, put the article to sleep.
- "To bed," Bob.
- Right.
Everybody at the office wasn't... altogether enthusiastic about it.
They wanted to change some things like, my face.
Yeah, I-
I reread it and made some changes on my own.
Oh, I'm really glad you did, because, you know... there were some things that even bothered me.
You know, like this part where you call Phil Newman...
"the sultan of silicone."
I didn't change that.
What about Dr. Harris?
Oh, yeah, I felt that I treated her with kid gloves.
So, I added that she was pretentious and seemed to be... more concerned with herself than with the practice of medicine.
Oh, She'll like that much better.
Did you change any of the stuff about Bob?
Yeah. 
I added that, "Dr. Hartley's therapeutic technique... was effective but unspectacular."
And I took out the crack about the ugly tie.
Told you it was ugly.
You gave me that tie.
I gave it to you as a joke.
Come in, Howard. 
It's open.
Oh, no, Bob. 
I'm not gonna fall for that again.
Come on. 
Let him in.
Let him in.
- Oh, that smarts!
- What happened this time?
I got hit by the newspaper when they threw them off the truck.
- Oh- 
- Are you okay?
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'm okay.
They say when you get old, you don't need your shins.
Don't worry about me.
Just read the article.
Well, I can't find it.
Here it is. 
It's in the "Good Neighbor" column.
Oh, yeah. 
Right next to the, shipping arrivals.
There we all are in Jerry's office.
That's not my article.
It's just a picture.
"Today's Good Neighbors."
"Doctors pitch in to help plumber Roland Snead, 44...
"repair a spit sink...
"in the true spirit of the Windy City.
Snead is left-handed and a widower."
I broke my shins for that?
I guess the editor didn't like it.
Or maybe there was a fast-breaking news story.
Yeah, yeah. 
That's it.
Here it is.
"Chicago may get azalea festival."
Hey, that sounds exciting!
Boy, maybe my shins will be better by then.
They will be, Howard.
They say your shins are the first to go.
Not in your case, Howard.
In conclusion, since I regard psychology as a serious... albeit unspectacular profession...
I cannot accept the invitation to attend... your Psychology Day picnic and carnival... nor will I participate as a contestant... in the primal scream-off.
Come in.
- Hi, Bob.
- Oh, hi, Morty.
Here are those pictures you ordered.
- You didn't have to bring them yourself.
- It's my pleasure.
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on my way to a fire.
Well, I appreciate it.
That's all right.
I do have a problem though.
I won't be able to take pictures of the fire unless-
Yeah, I'll load it for you, Morty.
Thanks, Bob.
You get it loaded, and...
I'll be in the coffee shop.
