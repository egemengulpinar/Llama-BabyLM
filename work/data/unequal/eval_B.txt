Doctor  's obviously a more frugal character than me because he had this room and the radiator was turned off.
I have turned it on and it is doing its little best  but our guests from the south are obviously  
I'll, I'll  
sequins, it sounds like  Come Dancing .
Oh I don't know I'm sure  say anything rude.
No  honest.
Do they?
some voices aren't allowed to er appear.
Are you still in here?
It it's okay carry on it's alright I'm, I  
Right.
Okay I'm sorry I haven't had level three supervision groups before so this is a whole new experience for me 
Well we're very high powered you know  
Chris has given me my instructions so 
Oh no 
I'm supposed to first say is th are you finding the course okay and to ask you about your projects.
So course okay so far?
supervisor.
So Mike have you got your project sorted out?
Well it's more or less in hand, yeah.
What what you're doing?
Yeah 
With Stewart?
yeah.
So is it just a continuation of what you've done anyway?
Well more or less but he weren't amused at any of the results so 
Oh I see right.
I've  got to start again .
That's rotten.
So are y are you just do 
No it's quite fair actually.
are you just doing are you just doing one er sorry j er are you just doing one project  a t a two term project?
Yeah.
Right so you're s you're sorted out.
Charles what are you doing?
Er I'm doing something on wild salmon.
Oh right.
Who, who are you er with?
Er with Gordon.
?
Yeah.
Oh right, so what are you, tell us about it, what are you going to do?
Erm well  Alex and I are both doing it but Alex has got his own rivers  so he's doing it on his own sort of thing 
Alex 
and er I'm  I'm, think I'm doing mine more sort of related to er the eggs.
Right.
So where 
Well sort of looking in that, that s er on the Tyne.
Oh right.
So I mean is this eggs that are put in by the, I mean I 
Er yeah I think it will have something to do with that, yeah.
I've sort of er I've
So are you just doing a lit is it, is it a two term project as well?
Yeah.
And you're just starting a  research?
Yeah.
Right.
I've started that, I've gotta, just gotta  I went and played on the computers yesterday.
You went what?
And played on the computers yesterday  
Oh right, oh right.
Have you all, by the way have you all tried this C D rom thing
Mm
in the library?
It's quite fun.
It's quite fun, have you tried that?
Yeah that's what I tried yesterday.
Has anyone got anything useful out of it yet?
No it's  
Yeah I know but they're not exactly over run with them are they?
in the library or down here we have to do  
Have you got to be more specific with your requests?
I haven't tried it.
Well probably but it do it s I mean it, you either put in  I, I mean I  most, most 
You're doing  
most of the things that I've done have been on Atlantic salmon and you put in Atlantic salmon and you get seven thousand eight hundred 
Yeah.
and forty abstracts out  
Right 
forget that.
And you narrow it down and you get zero.
Oh right, right.
Right, so you've got to play about with the system a bit more?
I think so I think so.
Right.
ASFA I think it's more helpful I think than C D rom isn't it?
What's the difference between ASFA and C D rom?
It's spelt different.
No but ASFA is just on the  scientific end

Oh.
You can ask him if it's alright to keep you in your tablets.
I'm going to start .
I tell you when I was in here it was just keeping calm.
And I'd no been to  bloody.
Aye well  Nothing Doctor  can do,
I know but he .
He would need to go up and see .
Doctor 
Ah.
What's up with young John today?
Oh my  Strathclyde Hospital on Wednesday,
Aha.
and they er sort of X-rayed me, took a urine sample, took a blood sample, er Doctor
Aha.
He examined me.
Erm he f he found, know how they were wrong about a slight murmur on my heart?
Mhm.
He couldn't find it.
He says it could have been  anxiety
Mhm.
or 
hospital
Aye just
So there was nothing really 
nothing to worry about.
Good.
I'm delighted to hear that.
But he did say that er it'll take three weeks before he can get back to me about sending me to the Law  
Mhm.
He says that, see the biopsy and the other?
Yeah.
He says that I might not need to get it right?
Because he, he'll be able to tell off my blood.
Mhm.
So he, he's still to decide about that.
Yeah.
Right.
Aye, and he also agreed with you about the lump in my back.
Mhm.
Right?
Yeah.
And he s he said the same as you, that er
If it's not bothering you, leave it alone.
Aye.
Said the exact same as you.
Oh aye.
Och aye.
It's not, not sensible.
Now then.
Here you are young John.
Honestly, I'm gutted with this cold the noo, could you give me
Mhm.
Yeah,
something for it?
sure.
How're you doing with the, the drink?
Oh.
I have my good days and bad days.
How many good ones and how bad ones?
during the day.
Too many bad ones.
I just cannae seem to get off it at all.
Well, keep it down as low as you can because the lower you keep it, the less chance there is of getting this biopsy done.
I thought they were just going to X-ray me back, but they X-rayed everything.
Oh they would do.
They done the lot,
Yeah.
front, back, side.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
There you are John, And 
Right.
that'll get you rid of that.
Doctor  
Aye, we're really worried about him now.
He's getting worse.
Aye.
I mean see last night, we went to bed last night, he came in at noon didn't he?
I'm moving out.
I'm moving out, I'm going to go stay at me granny's.
I cannae stick my dad.
I'm just, I'm just moving out and er I just cannae cope any more.
They're 
Mhm.
everybody's talking about me.
Mhm.
I mean I, see the tablets you gave him?
Mhm.
I've got them.
Mhm.
I'm actually scared.
He's threatened, just a couple of times to take an overdose.
I'm scared to  too
Mhm.
Right.
too many at the one you know what I mean?
He's seeing Doctor  and
I was wondering if you'd heard anything from Doctor  ?
Doctor   what, if that happens Doctor  says that the next time he wants to see us along with him.
Mhm.
Yeah yeah.
Because he's worrying us.
Yeah.
See I don't know if it's just part real  or if he's just trying to frighten me.
Mhm.
It could be.
This i this is the thing, with youngsters like that, you never know.
I mean he doesn't want for nothing, he gets as much as I can give him.
It's nothing it's nothing to do 
He's got, he's got everything he could want.
Aye, it's nothing to do with wanting.
I mean see my see my next door neighbours, they're good
Mhm.
neighbours aren't they?
We don't even take any money off him for keep 
Aye.
or anything like that.
And he came in
let him keep everything.
he's sitting he's sitting in the living room on Sunday night.
Now these new wheely-bins, you take a turn each.
Mhm.
I'll just take the two, and Billy'll take them out the next week.
Mhm.
But on Sunday night we weren't in, and Billy looked in the kitchen.
We were at a night out.
He must have looked in the kitchen window.
Just to see
Mhm.
whether to take the bins out or not.
But our John was sitting reading the paper.
He's got a, they're all talking about me, he says they're listening at the walls or standing in the clossies 
Mhm.
I mean the things he's coming away with aren't real.
Aye.
Why is he seeing Doctor  ?
He's .
He's gonna see him again, don't get me wrong, Doctor  said he'll send for the both of us, right?
Mhm.
But he's getting to the point where I'm ready for saying to him away you go down to your granny's right, but my mam cannae live with him either.
No no.
Cos she's the same way.
She's phoning me.
She 
I think Doctor  only sits once a month, and  
Oh no.
No.
No.
Every week.
Is it every week?
Is it?
Mhm.
I thought it was only once a month.
No.
See when he's thing, you see when he's er down at his granny's, my mummy and my daddy are actually talking round about him trying to kid on that they're, they're ignoring him.
They they try to ignore him.
Know what I mean?
Mm.
Right.
I'll get on to him and we'll soon get this .
See I cannae walk by a bus stop.
There're two people at a bus stop, they two people's talking about him.
Yeah.
The night that they brought him up here.
A man walked in and he says hello to John and that and how's it going and that, he came into see you and I sat, I mean I came in 
Mhm.
out of the road, what's that man saying about me?
Aye I heard him saying how do you put up with an arsehole like that?
Thinks, he's paranoid.
He thinks everybody's talking about him.
Aye.
You know what I mean?
But this has just come on.
Mhm.
Oh aye.
This is how it comes.
This is how it comes, just
And I mean  I'm not wanting to make up any .
Ah but Doctor , it's plain to you, John's 
It may be the best thing for him.
John has been  put under psychologist because he was slow at school right?
Aha.
Aye.
And this is the start.
This is what's in his head.
He's no equal with anybody else.
Yet 
Ah.
he is cos we paid dear.
Yes yes yes.
But this is the thing, if he doesn't go there, if he needs to go there and he doesn't go there, he's going to get worse.
Aye.
Aye.
I mean he's going to get worse and worse and worse.
See, the way I feel I've, it's not a case
She even thinks
I know there was  
see because he w he was slow, he had trouble with learning 
Mhm.
at school, right?
Mhm.
See he  
S he thinks that all the ones that were at school with him are s talking 
about him.
Mhm.
That's right 
Still yet.
that's what he said, the first night he came in.
Aye.
The f the thing is if he needs to go in for treatment, he's only going to get worse if he doesn't get it.
But he'll say to me 
I said that and all.
But as I, like you know John when he talks about it.
If they found out 
I'm up there like I'm just going to stay up there, I'm never mind to come back here.
Do you know, she went to the bingo yesterday  her mother, right?
For that day out at the bingo with her mam.
And er he roa er he ranted for three hours too.
Mhm.
Kept repeating himself and, right?
Yeah.
And I'm sitting watching the telly trying to watch a film.
Tell him what happened with the police 
the police a fortnight ago.
I had to send for the police.
Mm.
Because he didn't 
I thought he was I thought he was going to do something to himself.
Or smash up the house or something.
See he smashed up the house on Christmas day.
Aha.
But he never 
For no reason at all,
Aye.
right.
Er then he, he, I sent for the police because he walked out the door and he, he threatened to kill himself.
I had to get the police to get him back.
See and I don't know whether he's tormenting us, or whether he's
Oh, you never know.
You cannae take the chance.
And I've got every tablet.
Even his.
Mhm.
I've got  of them all.
You can't, I mean there's, there's no way you can take a chance on it, Flora.
I mean if he's just  
I mean he's, he's the only kid we've got, and he's been 
Aye.
spoilt, you know what I mean?
It's no as if we've 
Doesn't, doesn't matter who it is.
Doesn't matter what age they are.
I mean, we've had them doing this at eight year old.
Aye.
And I've seen them doing this right up till they're in their eighties.
Do you think if I, do you think if I gave him a fright,s see the, time he says he's going off to his granny's and I say away you go, and my mam says she's not taking him.
Would you would you like to take the chance?
No.
I wouldn't either.
I know he's starting all these things, see his computers and that?
S maybe if I says to him away you go to your granny's and then and you're not taking anything with you.
No?
No.
It's not worth the risk Flora.
If he did anything
Well that night he walked out I was  wasn't I?
Mhm.
And he must have been, I've a feeling he was standing somewhere bloody well
Watching you.
Aye.
watching me.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
I mean,i if he, if you said something like that to him and he went away and he didn't turn up for two or three days, you would never live with yourself.
Maybe that 
Exactly.
Oh no.
No no.
Ju hold on.
Leave it with me.
I'll get in touch with Doctor .
Hope we'll get it organized as quick as we can.
Right, thanks Doctor .
Okay?
Right.
Right, thanks Doctor.
Okay, right Flora.
Right.
Don't do anything
I wouldn't.
Aye.
o okay.
Right then.
Right.
Right, cheerio now.

Right can you have a look  at those  Just have at the answers to this.
Did you find any difficulties at all?
N no I don't .
It looks all right from here.
Yeah.
Keep the tracing paper if you need it.
That's all right.
yes that's okay that's fine.
Hang on.
Oh yes alright from there.
How did you come to that conclusion?
What ?
the petrol station   the petrol station, isn't it?
Mm.
Mm  five minutes.
It's five minutes and fifteen.
I misread the .
That's okay.
in the first fifteen minutes of the journey   Yeah er    What's fifteen minutes  as part of an hour?
Quarter of a hour.
Quarter of an hour.
That's point two five.
Mm.
You can't
Mm.
You can't have time as a decimal, time is not a decimal.
Mm.
Okay?
I can't remember what it's called it's in sixties whatever that is.
Mhm.
Yeah.
S Time is not a decimal so you can't operate time as a decimal.
Nobody ever used to make that mistake at one time you know why?
No.
Because everything worked was wasn't in decimal.
Mm.
All the distances were in twelves 
Mm.
and for and weights were in fourteens so 
Aha.
nobody ever thought about anything being a decimal.
Mhm.
So nobody had any problems with that.
No of course that everything's de- you know everything's decimal time
Yeah.
becomes quite an awkward calculation.
It didn't used to be.
It didn't.   not been interrupted.
same constant speed.
So you work the same the constant speed.
.
Yeah w shouldn't matter ,
yeah.
that's fine.
Aha.
Doesn't make any difference at all that doesn't.
Erm so you would have done  er yeah then you've got You've got your speed of distance over time correctly.
Mm.
Or time is distance over speed.
It's all right, but  you've then  gone that's not nought point two five minutes the speed's per hour.
Isn't it?
Mm.
The speed is per hour  isn't it?
So that would have been  point two five which should have been fifteen minutes.
Yes that's sixtieth of an hour 
Which is point two five of an hour.
Be very careful with your 
Mm.
units.
Yeah.
That's
Mm.
The calculation's fine what you've done's fine just mucked 
Put the wrong 
the units up.
Yeah.
Right?
So that's  How many minutes earlier?
Now you've not done that you've actually done his journey time .
Mm.
Mm?
So careful read the question.
You must read the question!
Alright, how're you getting on with them?
Or have I stopped you?
Didn't know what I'm supposed to be doing with that .
Your supposed to be doing them rotate them through Do this one first.
How do you mean  them?
Hundred and eighty degree rotation around C.
doing it Do you mean drawing it on Using this drawing it?
Yeah.
You've done rotations and reflections and so forth haven't you?
Mm.
Mhm.
that rotated a hundred and eighty degrees about that.
Mm.
brought it by  isn't it?
But I know what to do I don't know what you want me to do.
I want it I want it shown as a hundred and eighty degree rotation.
There's an exam question  Rotate that
Yeah.
about that point the hu Through a hundred and eighty degrees .
Mm.
four.
What your not so  Fine.
Yeah.
Okay yes good.
That's alright.
Use the patterns to write down  the A three.
A Three is that that that that that.
A four    Lets have a look.
Is it done?
No I haven't done anything yet I'm on .
Look
I can't do it!
I can't .
You haven't done rotations have you?
Yeah I have but I don't how to do them like this I've not seen it been d drawn out like that.
Right draw something from the centre of rotation to the the figure.
Mm.
Rotate that bit through a hundred and eighty degrees where's it go?
Over here.
Over there.
There's a hundred 
Yes.
and eighty innit?
Trace the original.
Yes.
Mm.
Round the centre of rotation  it to the spoke while she's up the other spoke.
Dum.
Mm.
Mm?
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
it's as simple as that.
Isn't it?
.
Go on then.
as if you've drawn.
Have you got a pencil?
No I was looking at the other one.
No I want it actually done I want you 
to physically do 'em .
Right erm 
So they go into your brain
Mm.
via your eyes and and 
finger ends and so forth.
Mhm.
Okay?
Mhm.
I suppose I should put Nyah Right okay simultaneous equations.
Yeah.
With some degree of er  success I trust this time.
I think I messed number one up.
Ah dear.
Yes you did.
You know why?
No.
You made the classic mistake the only mistake there is here you multiply everything by two
Mm.
So that's twenty six.
Mm.
That's the only I mean that's th that's the real problem with this thing It's one the the difficulties you end up with You see you must remember to multiply everything that's there by the number you want to multiply, not just half of it.
And that's all the problem is.
I think I've done the others right.
Yes that looks alright.
Yeah.
Well you can always tell can't you?
How do you tell?
St st st just stick 
Go back and check it  
the numbers back in.
Just put the numbers back in.
Yeah it's alright.
Yeah it's alright.
You see you managed to  plough through these quite r readily did you?
Sort of.
Ah.
What on earth's that question?
Two A plus
Oh it's an A is it?
Oh I beg your pardon sorry
I changed it to  .
That's al that's alright that's alright I'm with that.
I understand what you're doing it's a substitution.
It's a little like As and Bs.
Er it doesn't make any difference does it?
No but I'm used to Xs and Ys.
Yes but A Yeah that's alright erm except for examples  we where do up to?
Ten.
Up to ten.
Yes.
Have a go at fourteen and sixteen.
Whilst I sit here and admire your expertise and 
Ha.
general  facility at this subject.
Mm.
And say to yourself
Nine seven nine C plus 
Yep.
Or four Y minus minus nine.
Yeah.
Which is probably as good.
Thirteen.
Thirteen is right.
twenty six 
That's okay.
Y equals 
Y equals  What're you gonna do?
Divide it.
Yeah, whoa.
Right it's two isn't it?
Mm.
Okay.
Substitute that back in .
Yes that's right.
Yes.
Do number seventeen.
But I haven't done sixteen.
Just do number seventeen I fancy seventeen better than number sixteen.
Mhm, you would.
I know.
I have this great in-built desire to make people suffer.
There's an easier way of doing it isn't there?
What get rid of the Ys?
Yes.
Mm.
Suppose so.
Yeah there is is There's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two aren't you?
Yeah.
You must look at this from the minimum of Point of view of the minimum amount of labour.
Yeah.
Equals twenty six.
No it doesn't.
I beg your pardon yes it does..
Mm.
Yes it does.
You're right.
That's right.
and X equals 
Thirty three.
Yeah.
Alright we  need to bother a I know you I know you can do substitution.
Yeah thing about it is though when you're looking at this, you wanna be looking as to which is the Produces the smallest numbers.
mm.
And which produces the minimum amount of manipulation and that was that the second one wasn't it?
Yeah.
You had much less to do than anything else.
Mm.
Right that's unfortunate.
That I l I've forgotten to bring the other work.
However.
Can I Can I just interrupt and say I've forgotten .
I'm sorry is that enough?
Yes.
thank you.
Eye's funny.
Yeah.
Now look it asks you for a certain number of things It says As The average doesn't it?
How 
Yes.
Do you work t an average?
Average is all the tests added together
Yeah,
divide by the number of tests he had.
That's right.
So what's the total for all his test?
Hundred and twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six how many tests had he had?
X.
X.
So the average is going to be?
Hundred and twenty five divide by x.
Hundred an Is it a hundred and twenty five?
twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six divided by X is that.
Yeah.
So what's difficult about that?
Nothing.
So.
Now there's another two tests.
Yeah.
So what's the total now?
Hundred and twenty eight  divide by
Where's a hundred and twenty eight come from?
What's the total marks for the next two tests?
Oh.
You're told what the marks are for the next two tests aren 
Oh nine and eight.
Nine and eight aren't they?
Yeah.
So what's the total marks for the Now for the the tests?
How many marks you got all together?
Hundred and   twenty thirty  forty   forty two .
Mm.
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
No!
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
Come on what's nine add six ?
Hundred and thirty six.
O What's nine add six?
Eleven.
Nine add six?
Oh  Fourteen.
And another one.
Six 
fifteen yeah?
Yes.
Six and nine it's always one less when innit when you're adding nine?
So it's fifteen do it's a hundred and twenty six plus nine is?
hundred and thirty forty.
I want a hundred and twenty six plus nine!
Oh a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty  five.
Hundred and thirty five.
What's five and eight?
Not
Thirteen.
Thirteen so the answer's gonna be a hundred and?
Forty three.
Hundred and forty three.
You know what the a en end number's gonna be every time i Don't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Hundred and forty three.
That's right so the total's a hundred and forty three.
So what's the what's the average gonna be or even the mean?
Hundred and forty three  divide by 
By 
X plus two.
Splendid.
Can we have it written down like real mathematicians?
Ah wonderful.
Wonderful.
hundred and forty five.
Yes No I said a hundred and forty 
Forty three 
three yes.
Over 
Divide by X plus two .
plus two that's right.
Now what's the next part of the question say?
If if a If his average for the first X test was one greater than his average for
X plus two tests .
plus two tests .
Use results of one and two 
To form the equation and find the value of X. 
Now what it just said  think of another way of saying that.
Work out what X is.
No you can't work out what X is you haven't got a c hope of working out wh 
Form an equation.
Form an equation.
But what's one side of the equation going to be?
Hundred and twenty six divide by X.
Plus?
Hundred and fort 
No no
plus two
No no read what it says.
If his average for the first X tests is one greater than the average  Sorry beg your pardon I've got it round me  round me neck.
If his average for the first X t is one greater than his average for the X plus two tests   So a hundred and twenty six over X is gonna equal?
What he got in the first
O in the second lot  isn't it?
Plus one.
Mm.
Yes.
So right it down.
Yeah come on!
Just write it down!
Hundred and twen 
What?
What I've just told you hundred and twenty six over X is equal?
Hundred and forty three 
Three 
divide by X plus two
Yeah.
Plus one.
Yes.
Plus one.
Why is it plus one there?
Cos it's says it's This is one more than that isn't it?
This is one more than that.
So shouldn't that be plus one?
How do you make them equal?
Oh yeah.
Yes think about it carefully.
How do you make them equal.
Mm.
That's right so.
Now what are you going to do?
Find the value of X.
I'm an extremely patient soul as you well know,but if you say Find the value of X to me again How are you gonna  find the value of X?
What do you intend to do?
Get rid of the denominators.
Get rid of the denominators, good.
Well done.
Go on then.
Is that right?
No.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
Timesing it by X.
Alright then times it by X.
Go on then if that's what you're doing go on.
Keep going!
Hold on a minute you've still got a this on the bottom haven't you?
To start with come on.
Cos your multiplying by X go on you haven't cancelled it yet go on.
Carry on.
Eh?
What are you doing?
You can't do that!
Why?
Multiply everything by X go on.
Ju just do every term you've got multiply it by X.
Go on.
I don't know how to do it though.
Course you do!
Just carry on multiplying things by X instead of trying to jump to conclusions.
Where's the two X come from?
Times it by 
But you've got that over th on the bottom haven't you?
It's X plus two there, isn't it?
It's got nothing to do when multiplying You're multiplying the top by X go on.
That's better.
That's right perfect.
Go on then, get some stuff cancelled out.
That's right.
No.
There's no way you can do that.
But I've got an X on the top.
Aye but you've got an X plus two on the bottom.
So if I put X minus two on the top?
No it will not cancel.
Why not?
You've got a hundred and forty three X over X plus two, haven't you?
Hundred and forty three minus two.
Hundred and forty does not work.
There's no way that works at all.
Just do what you've got there.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
That's right, equals.
Hundred and forty three X over  X plus two.
That's right.
Plus X.
That's perfect now what are you going to do?
Can I move across That across to this side?
You can multiply everything through by X plus two, yes.
Go on.
Bracket, X plus two never mind about this s Mm.
Equals  that plus  Come on you're multiplying by X plus two.
No  you're multiplying by X plus two.
You've missed a You've now dropped a plus sign out haven't you?
And you've dropped an X out.
Why?
You're multiplying this term by X plus two aren't you?
You're 
Mm.
gonna multiply everything by X plus X plus two.
It just so happens that if multiply this term by X plus two you get rid of the X plus two at the bottom don't you?
Mm.
But everything there It's the same thing as when you were doing this.
The simultaneous equations wasn't it?
Why was it?
You had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out, haven't you?
Yeah.
So here you've got to multiply every term out.
Do not forget that that is a term on its own it's got n connected to this yet.
No.
You're a very very careful about that so start getting it tidied up then.
Expand the brackets I think is probably the best thing.
Hundred and twenty six X 
S X that's right.
Plus two hundred and fifty two.
Equals
Hundred and forty three X 
X 
Plus
X squared  
X squared plus two X.
That's right.
Right now things are getting a bit better aren't they?
Come on!
What're you gonna do now?
Do all the Xs on one side.
Well I'd collect the things together that were the same for a start I think.
What d'you mean?
Well you've got some Xs to collect together haven't you?
Oh.
Mm?
That's better.
That's simplified it.
Yeah.
Now s You can start you've still gotta get the every I would get everything over to one side of the equals sign.
Why?
What's this ?
Then use your quadratic  .
This is a quadratic isn't it?
Yes good.
Does it matter which way you put it?
Well I always like to read it from left to right but it doesn't matter really.
Yeah but I mean
you can do that if you want to.
I would have put all the  the er
Hundred and forty five X minus hundred and twenty six X .
Yes.
Plus x squared  minus two five two 
Minus two five two.
Equals nothing.
Yes.
So that's going to be 
Don't look at me like that!
Nineteen X.
Mhm.
Plus X squared.
Yeah.
Minus two five two .
minus two five two Equals nothing .
Equals nothing that's right.
Now if you're gonna do this you really want it in the form of X squared first don't you?really to make it To make  the thing easy to work, aren't you?
Well that's gonna be your A.
Yeah it is.
B and that's gonna be C .
It's much be It's much better to see it as A square As X squared plus te nineteen X plus minus two two five, really.
Two five two equals nothing.
Right.
Formula.
I don't know.
You're gonna have some tremendously large numbers if you work the formula aren't you?
Yes.
I mean B squared's nineteen squares you know just under four hundred isn't it?
That's twenty times twenty.
You imagine four times that.
A lot.
It's a lot isn't it?
But they're only numbers.
that's true.
But perhaps it's easier I wonder what are other factors of two hundred and fifty two?
One.
One and two hundred and fifty two, yes very good yes.
Two.
Yes good.
We want a difference of nineteen somewhere don't we?
That's easy.
We drop the calculator everywhere.
Well you can drop the calculator if you want it would be better if you pick 'em up and stick the  numbers in.
How're you gonna do?
Two hundred and fifty two divide by nineteen.
What you got?
Thirteen point two six three one five 
Yes.
seven nine eight.
Yes.
I don't think that's right.
Try the square root of two five two.
Fifteen point eight seven four five  
Yes yes ,a difference.
Don't know  does sixteen go into it just try sixteen into two five two.
Fifteen point seven five.
So we want something like erm  Seven and sixteen, well that doesn't work Sorry seven and twenty six.
Is that right?
No.
How about
No, gives a difference of nineteen.
Use the formula then, we're just sitting here wasting time.
Minus nineteen  or minus B plus or minus the square root of B 
Minus B 
Plus or minus
plus or minus the square root of

All over
Two A.
Two A is right.
So what's A?
It's an X!
Must be true.
Yes.
I am delighted you agree.
Yeah.
Minus nineteen
Yes.
plus or minus
The square root of nineteen squared minus four times

Lovely.
All over 
Over two
Two times one.
Yep.
X squared.
X equals not X squared.
Minus nineteen  plus or minus 
plus or minus Can I do that 
Root 
all in one?
Yeah!
I can do it on here, oops!
Hope so.
Square root of nineteen squared minus four times times minus 
Minus 
two five two.
Answer.
Nineteen squared's three hundred and ninety ninety one I think.
Mm.
Three hundred and sixty one.
Really?
Three sixty one times  eight thousand There's summat wrong.
Nineteen squared minus four times one 
No it's minus It's plus It's nineteen squared plus eight  nought  one nought nought eight.
Mm.
Four time two five two.
Two hundred and fifty times four is a thousand Two hundred and fift 
It's minus!
It's minus times a minus  Isn't it?
Four
four times two th two five two is one thousand and eight isn't it?
Yes.
Two fifty times four is a thousand.
So two five two times four is t one thousand and eight, plus three hundred and chunkety chunk Three hundred and sixty one.
Mm.
Which is one three six nine.
That's more like it.
Yeah but what about mm.
above answer.
Mm.
What about that?
Where do  get that from?
Because what you did was you did er nineteen squared
Yes.
minus four.
I don't know why I don't how that works 
Would that be in brackets?
Of course it is.
I didn't put a brackets there.
Well you would have to although I would have though it might have worked algebraically that's certainly wrong though.
What did we say?
One three six  nine .
Nine.
One three six nine, yes.
All over 
Er you want the square root of that.
that's it all over two.
Two.
Yep, so it's minus nineteen plus or minus 
Plus or minus 
root one three six nine.
Square root 
One three six nine.
That's interesting.
Ah!
Yes go on.
Yeah it is isn't it?
Yes.
Go on then.
You'll remember that.
I will.
Thirty seven.
So the f One answer is f fourteen 
Don't!
Just don't!
It's not actually.
One answer's nine innit?
Minus nought point five?
Yeah.
And the other answer is?
Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five, how you managed to produce  that?
Don't know.
Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator  must be about eighteen mustn't it?
Mm.
The difference between thirty seven and nineteen's about eighteen innit?
Approximately?
Divide that by two, answer?
Nine.
Nine.
Mm.
Engage brain  Th You must regard a calculator 
with the greatest and gravest of suspicion.
Cos it's not actually working algebraic that calculator at the present moment I don't know what you've got it programmed in What you've got it at but it's not working algebraic.
Now it might work.
No unless we have to Minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight?
Yeah that's better.
I wonder if  minus.
Wait you've got minus fifty six haven't you here? this is minus fifty six if you use your brain.
And divided by two is minus twenty eight.
Yeah.
Yes minus twenty eight.
Now if you You take the difference between nineteen and thirty seven you get the answer eighteen don't you?
Yes.
You divide that by two you get the answer nine .
Nine.
Mm.
But why isn't my calculator working?
Because you haven't got it in the correct mode it's not working algebraic.
Which is in what function?
Who knows what your calculator and that's a such a wonderful piece of work that.
Yeah but  
Scie Scientific or You want it in scientific mode if it says scientific
Yeah it does.
In that case use it in scientific and then it will work that way.
Will it?
Yeah well it should do.
Anyway.
.
Okay.
Let's read the second part of this question cos it's taken us er quite some time to do it but excellent question.
Hasn't it 
Right 
Right let's read the second part of this.
It has an average of thirteen point five marks for the first X plus one tests.
His mark on the last test gave him a final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
What was his marks for the last test.
How do you work out his total marks for his X plus one tests.
Thirteen point five divided by X plus one.
That's his No no you've got his average as thirteen point five haven't you?
How do you work out his total marks which is what we're really looking for?
Times X plus
Yes, it's thirteen point five times X plus one.
And how do you work out his total marks for his X plus two tests?
Fourteen times thirteen plus two.
No no no.
Why?
Fourteen times what?
Times X plus  two.
Yeah.
That's what I said!
Was it?
I'm sorry I misheard you.
So what it's alright.
Mm.
I misheard you okay?
Mm.
So, it might be a good idea to write that down and work it out.
Thirteen point five
Yes
times
Will you stop doing that!
What?
That!
What's wrong with it?
How do you write a multiplication in algebra?
You're gonna multiply that by X plus one aren't you?
Mm.
How do you write that?
Hundred and thirty five X plus one.
Bracket.
X plus one.
X plus one.
Ha?
Suppose so.
That's how you write it.
Minus fourteen
Never mind about this silliness, that 
you've been allowed to get away with.
Right go and work them out then.
Thirteen point five times one is?
Thirteen point five innit?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Okay.
So what's your total marks?
Sorry what's the difference?
Fourteen point five.
You know what he total mark for  his X plus one test was don't you?
Mm.
And you know the total mark was X plus two tests.
It actually asks you for the mark he obtained for his final tests doesn't it?
Yeah.
So if you take two away, one from the other, you'll have the mark
Nought point five.
for his test won't you?
So you'll have nought point five X plus?
Plus 
Point about it is y you can't see it, can you unless you've got it written down so write it down.
it's thirteen well it's fourteen X isn't it?
Mm.
Plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Or minus thirteen X plus thirteen point five isn't it?
Why is it?
Well you're taking the difference between the two aren't you?
So don't you just minus them?
Yeah.
So that's fourteen X plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Yes?
Mm.
So that's nought point five X, now what?
Plus 
Plus what's the difference here?
Hundred and thir Hundred 
What's twenty eight minus thirteen point five?
Oh it's point five!
Yes.
What's twenty eight minus thirteen poin 
Fourteen point five.
Fourteen point five.
Okay.
So wouldn't 
That's 
you times it by two?
Another student has his average as thirteen point five marks for the first blah blah blah, right.
Which marks for the last test give a final average of fourteen marks for   So the one test is gonna give him that isn't it?
That's right you agree isn't it?
That's his total marks for X plus one tests, is there.
Total marks for S plus plus two tests is there.
The actual mark  is that.
That's for his nought  nought point five X.
So to get those two up to one X  
up to one X you should times by two which is twenty nine.
Which I don't believe.
Well do you times it by four?
No give   but his mark on his last test gave him the final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
So that's his total there and his total there.
Yes it's gonna be doubled hasn't it to give you that?
Oh!
Oh dear!
How daft can you get?
What's the value of X?
W we worked that out somewhere didn't we?
We did didn't we?
Oh!
Oh!
Nearly as bad as .
Dear oh dear!
Eh?
Oh.
Innit?
I'm very tired .
So what do you do?
Times thirteen point five X by
Well you do thirteen point five times ten if you want.
Yes.
And fourteen times eleven.
Why eleven?
Well nine plus two is eleven isn't it?
Yes.
Hundred and fifty four.
Now who is being dormant?
And you've got it haven't you?
Then you find the difference?
Yes.
That makes sense.
actually work here hasn't it?
Does that give you the same answer?
Yes it should do.
Let's just check it go on.
You had thirteen point five times ten which I think is a hundred and thirty five in normal circumstances.
Yes.
And a hundred and f fourteen times eleven.
Go on it's a hundred and fifty four.
Minus nineteen.
No minus a hundred and thirty five.
One fifty four minus hundred and thirty five.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
Which is wh what we would have done if we'd done 
If we'd done 
that better.
Yeah but it we it's a spurious argument because you've got nought point five X haven't you?
Yeah.
Nought point five X i Nought point five of X i is four point five isn't it/
Yeah.
Four point five plus fourteen point five  Answer?
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
We actually got it right both ways.
But it would have been simpler to have done it that way I think.
And quicker.
And quicker.
But not as entertaining.
Yes.
Not as entertaining.
Mm.
If you like.
Yes.
They have a tendency to ask questions not quite as comp Not quite as  abstract as that.
Intricate.
Not even intric Not quite as abstract cos th the the tendency is to ask the question The average weight of nine people is whatever it is, you know somebody else has added 
Yeah  questions.
Yeah yeah.
Rather than quite as abstract as that But you can cope with abstract as that you can do A level.
Yeah.
You have to cope 
You have to  You have to be as abstract as that.
Which will not do you any harm.
Good.
A man bought three box of Dutch cigars.
Good lord how appalling in this day and age!
Three boxes!
At X pence per box, and two boxes of Havana cigars  at Y pence per box.
Calculate terms of X and Y 
Cost of the five boxes.
So what's the cost of the Dutch ones?
How many boxes?
Three X.
Splendid.
What's the cost of the Havanas?
Two Y.
So what's the total cost?
Five X two Y.
Eh?
Five X plus two Y.
Five X plus two Y not just five x two Y.
Plus two Y.
Five X plus two Y.
Wonderful.
Go on 
the average  cost per box in terms of X and Y.
So what's the average b cost per box gonna be?five X plus two Y you better write that down before our brains refuse to accept any more information.
Two Y is the total cost, how do you find the average?
How do you find an average?
Add them together and divide by the number you've got.
How many have you got.
Five.
No you haven't.
We've got five boxes.
No you haven't got five boxes.
Why?
Read it again.
Three boxes of Dutch 
Whoops!
That's supposed to be three X .
That's a three.
Yes that's better.
So you haven't got 
.
F Divide that by five.
Divide that by five.
Yes.
The whole of it?
Yeah.
Cos that's the total price isn't?
Total cost.
Total of boxes you mean.
Total cost.
Five's the total number of boxes but that the top one's the total cost isn't it?
Yea.
That's right.
Yep.
Yes.
Oh..
At a profit of thirty three percent of their costs .
How do 
Thir 
work that out?
Thirty three and a third percent is a third.
Yes.
So I want a third of their  their costs.
So what did he sell  the Dutch box 
Which is the Dutch which is that half.
Well,later he sold his three boxes of Dutch cigars at a profit of thirty three of their cost.
Mm?
So 
So that's three X divided by
No it's not three X divided by five, it's says of their cost.
Thy cost three X didn't they?
Yes.
And the sold them for a third profit so what did he sell them for?
X plus a third.
If he sold the things for 
Four 
thirt Aye.
Four thirds.
No.
I if 
If he's got 
he bought them for three quid?
Yes.
Yeah/ Which is highly improbable but he bought them for three pounds
Yes.
In the days when a gold sovereign meant something when you went abroad 
Yes.
And he sold them that was his cost was three pounds.
And he h He sold them at a profit of thirty three and a third percent which is a third.
What did he sell them for?
Four pounds.
Four quid.
So if he 
four X.
No if he cost him three X, what's he gonna sell them for?
Four X.
Yes.
So he sells his Dutch s cigars for four x.
When he only bought them for three X?
That's right.
So he sold them for four X.
Yeah.
Then what did he do with his havanas?
HE gave away the other two boxes as presents.
Strange man.
A strange fellow.
Well no it probably a little bit of sweetener for a business deal later one perhaps?
Mm.
Yes.
I used to get bottles of whisky at Christmas and so forth.
And we stole it .
Yes you now what it m Yes you know all about that?
Yes.
Yes.
So it's a box of h s Havana cigars.
So how much profit did he make on that?
He didn't did he?
He made 
absolutely no profit at all, in fact he made a loss of?
Two X.
Two Y.
Yes two Y.
Yeah.
Calculate the amount he received for the sale of the cigars.

Come in.
Hello.
Hello  what can we 
do for you sir?
It's this shoulder stuffed up again.
Having trouble again?
Aye.
headaches  
Mhm.
you know they're getting worse and worse and worse.
I think it's the .
Wasn't it  or something you gave me?
Yes.
Oh.
That was January.
Oh aye.
Right .
But now it's actually spread you know th the pain seems to be spread all right up here.
?
Aye.
Ah.
Well that's right enough what I thought.
It's been a neural neuralgia right enough.
Mm.
It's when I go to lie down at night you know that's it.
and then the headaches just start.
You know?
When, when you were taking the  was it  better?
No.
No change at all?
No.
No change.
No.
No change at all.
Right.
I don't want to give you anything that's gonna knock you  silly or
Mm.
dopey with it or anything like that.
Mm .
I want to get the right sort of thing for you.
You know I'm going around lightheaded with it y you know and dizzy with it you know?
Yeah.
Tt er 
been reading too much in this Sunday Post.
She's got me this and that and all the rest of it you know?
Mm.
But I don't know what you've got without waiting for any  I 
couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell you.
It's er  
I'm still trying to give up the cigarettes you know?
I got those patches.
So  Mm.
Do these patches seem alright though?
Have you seen ?
Yes.
Aye and they're  
Oh.
Patches are fine.
Are they?
Aye.
There's nothing wrong with them.
It's very difficult to do er two things at the same time.
Mm.
Very difficult if you've got, and you know giving up is fine
Mm.
if you haven't got a broken ankle or a sore, sore 
Mhm.
shoulder or
No.
headaches or, fine.
Mm.
do it.
No.
But when you've got something else  that's hard.
Mm.
That's hard.
Mm.
Even with the patches.
I went onto er you know rolling my cigarettes up myself so I wouldn't be
Mhm.
smoking as much.
I started blaming that for the headaches.
They just seem to come on you know?
Mhm.
Well don't, don't do anything.
Just get rid of one thing before you start 
before you start doing anything else.
Mm .
Here we are now.
That's that.
Actually  travel this  .
Ah.
Yes it'll, it'll travel right down to the tips
Ah.
of your fingers.
Aye.
If you feel that there's
Are you  tonight?
No.
I'm on er I signed off   
Oh right.
too right.
Okay.
Fine.
Mm.
You get started on that and we'll see 
you in about four weeks
Right.
and see how it's doing.
Okay then.
Right.
Okay.
Thank you very much then Doctor .
Okay.
Cheerio then.

Next patient Dr .
Come in, come in.
Morning Doctor.
Good morning.
Now what can I do for this lady?
My daughter's  Doctor.
I didn't really want  had a mastectomy.  another lump there.
Another lump?
It might only be breast tissue, I don't know that.
Mhm.
Let's have a wee look.
And she called him in on Sunday night, I mean I wouldn't have.
No.
Right.
It's hard.
But i it's like where the stitches are you know.
Where where the stitches were, right.
Well, partly where they are.
Right, er 
I just happened to feel it because the wounds haven't been healing Doctor,
Has it not?
using that erm what's the name of the cream?
That steroid cream?
Eumobate 
Aha.
Right.
Well, I've been to see Mr , and then I was off again to see him, and he said I was right.
But he didn't say whether I, I just continued with the cream, but it was the other night  I just felt wee .
Could be a bit of breast tissue, I don't know.
But it is quite a hard lump.
Aye, he was quite happy.
He couldn't feel anything
No he  
to worry about?
Mhm.
That's what he said.
Yes.
Here I felt a lump.
Yes,
In a different 
aye, it's a different bit.
It's higher.
It's up  he didn't  actually examine that part where I think there's a lump.
See after a breast operation does it take a long long time with stitches?
Oh yes.
Oh aye.
Aye cos I tried the prosthesis  and I tried the, but it just catches, and then er .
And it's 
Keeps, keeps rubbing against this, this is 
so sore.
Aye.
That's the worst bit.
That's the worst bit.
But 
In here.
but that's no where the lump is.
Let's have a wee look at this lump and see what 
Stupid, you're into a state, isn't it?
No, not.
Cos
in that bit.
See what's going on here.
Oh right you know what I .
That it?
Oh  
I think that's your rib.
My rib?
I think that's your rib.
No 
Aha, that's right.
Oh yeah.
That my rib?
That feels like a rib.
Oh Jesus.
Is it?
Aye.
That's your other one, that's the one on top, there's the one underneath.
And then there's, the other one's just underneath that, so  there.
Oh it's a rib then.
See that, that's your rib.
Aha.
It's hard?
Aye, oh it's hard.
Very very hard.
Because so was the last lump, hard and then it was  like you know?
That's right.
That's hard, yeah.
Right.
That's, that's, that's 
er the edge of your rib.
I don't think, I don't feel anything else there, Katrina.
Now when are you going back to see Mr ?
I go back 
Right.
I'll drop 
him a wee note, and tell him that you, that you, you know, you can feel this er I'll tell him I've had a look at it, and think it's the rib that's showing through.
I'll see what he says.
I've had a lot of bother with a wee bit of red blisters
Aye up the top.
That's, that's, that's the stitches.
you know  it's a bit of a  and it's really sore like.
And then as the day goes on, I've got to go and tear this off, cos it gets, these bits get red,
Red red raw.
oh really sore Doctor , you cannae
Right.
Then it comes in like a tingling feeling.
Like a, a ne a nettle stinging you you 
Right.
know.
And it's just 
Sounds 
the clothes that are doing that.
Aye, it sounds like the stitches right enough.
And does that take a long time?
I mean 
Yes.
I thought, I didn't think that it takes as long as that.
I mean he did say they were stitches that come out er what 
That there, you get, there are 
some stitches that c 
They stay in but he says that
That's right.
in the body.
But they don't come out with your , you know your bath.
That's right.
They're they're too 
They just integrate in the body .
They're too deep underneath the skin.
Aye, he said that.
The way the way
Cos I heard it takes as long.
That's why they take so long.
there's  now
Just keep on with that cream?
U use this stuff instead of that er Eumobate It's 
Aha.
slightly stronger.
Aha.
And that might do that, I'll drop Mr  a wee note, tell him that you've been in,
Aha.
so that when he sees you the next time, he'll double check that.
Aye.
Aha.
But I don't think there's anything 
Er 
to worry about Katrina.
I hope not.
No.
No.
I just, I just felt that it was the cream the other night, and then I just felt oh, you 
Mhm.
know b what I've been getting on Friday and Saturday night was an awfully big  
Yes.
in my shoulder.
Up, up over the top here.
On the shoulder, more 
Yes, that's right.
I've always been getting a shooting pain there that kind of happened and I just 
That's right.
thought it was the stitches.
That's, aye, it's, it's everything's beginning to get tight.
Tight now, aye.
This is, this is you starting to feel the sore bits.
But er 
I'll, I'll drop him a wee note anyway.
Aye.
Okay.
Right Katrina.
else I feel Doctor I've,
Aye.
got angina, and I've got the like the heart failure.
Mhm.
And I didn't want any breast off, naturally.
No no.
I mean but see the tremendous strain that it's putting on me?
Ah.
You know, I feel that is left, left  angina,because I've got to rip the brassiere off at a certain time of the day  
Aha.
extra weight.
The extra weight,
you know?
I didn't want any  off, I think I'd have .
Right Katrina .
Cheerio.
Right, okay, cheerio now.

Doctor , do you want to see Thomas  again?
There is, they're all  
Mm.
of .
Erm
Thomas.
Thomas .
Some of them er
Oh, yes.
Right.
there's a few times so I'll give you that four.
Is that?
D do you want to see him again?
Aye.
That's fine.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.

shortage was twenty five K Gs of .
You hadn't got the bags printed, the bags being printed today and Tony will make it today.
Currently Alan  is having extreme difficulty in getting hold of any dried blood.
Apparently we're not killing as many cows as we used to.
So there's a tremendous shortage, he's trying Germany, he's trying all over.
But the consequence is, until he gets it, we can't make any fish, blood and bone.
And that applies to twenty fives and obviously pre-packs.
Er  before I went off, we were talking about  packaging, have we decided to bring any in yet?
There's another few weeks have drifted and sooner or later we'll have to start making .
Yeah Alan and I are gonna go through the details  .
I've got a I've got a lot of things to talk about so 
you know before we do .
The next thing I'm not very happy about the supply of printed bags coming in from er the workshop.
Talking to Eric yesterday, how many should she be able to do an hour, five hundred erm approximately.
I said to Celia how many she thinks she can do a day, she thinks about two thousand, depending on what she's doing.
And when she worked here, she had her daughter working with her and they were a team and they went like a bomb.
Up there she's got no disrespect, somebody who's not quite as bright as they might be er and she's not working overtime as they would do here if they got behind, they're working half eight to half four is it Ray?
Yeah.
And in consequence you know, there's an accumulation.
Erm  Simon had a list Well we'd come and see him the thirty first of January, Tony came to me to work on it today, and that's not .
All I'm saying is at the moment, she can't apparently cope with the demand on her for bags.
According to Tony  we're going out of at the end of the month.
Well s well erm Pete said originally, at the end of the month but it looks like, with this problem, it's gonna be phasi If we can get some off-site at the end of the month.
It doesn't matter though does it if we overflow?
No because all we have to do is switch it on switch it off like that.
We don't give them any notice at all.
But I do believe that we should seriously look at getting say, internal usage bags for nutrients er bags for lime, anything that we have printed, we ought to look at the  and say to Mike or get 'em printed or something.
Okay.
Alright.
Lynne at a meeting yesterday, Tom  said to ask you please, no more  to be ordered.
That is  Ian, I'll give Ian a ring cos Ian r rings direct.
Okay.
Erm  Ray can you arrange please to send one hundred thousand J E B  bags up to?
Okay.
A complaint from George er  in the pre-packs this morning, reference er  going through the U V A. Apparently, I don't understand this but he says it's wearing out erm belts at a cost of a hundred and forty a pair every fortnight.
And last night he was out back here at work at nine o'clock.
And as a result of this, through the night, er Angela working in U V A produced two hundred and ninety seven.
Eig the three K G line when the machine and everything was running properly, you'd be getting six eighty.
Er I mean obviously  be due to 
Right in the back.
Angela's er lack of experience yeah .
George  inexperience.
And he says it's I think he was gonna talk to you about it .
Yeah yeah.
he has done this morning, and he's talked to us about the film.
I think 
Yeah.
the machine side of it.
Yeah yeah.
We know there's a problem and we've all gone back in and .
Er Tom  has also asked for twenty tonne of anutrients to go up to.
Er  this week's production sheet er and I wonder of Ian could bear in mind that he should try and keep an extra ten tonne when he's looking at his reserves here just in case 
and we don't get stuck in the middle of an export  .
He'd already he'd seen the bags going up and he'd already got that in his head.
But  you see he knows he's gotta keep something back.
If he can
Yeah.
keep up a reserve here so that 
Yeah  
send them five or ten tonne.
Yeah.
Er one thing Stewart, erm any word for from John  about the state of the ?
No no .
Right, on the  thing, just finally, there's a hundred and thirty thousand  growbags here  next week.
And currently we've got a hundred and thirty four thousand cos we've got four days production  to build up the surplus.
But we've got eighteen thousand three hundred and thirty .
My count at the moment, I reckon we've got scattered round the countryside, ten thousand.
Which would cover us for Friday and Monday's loadings.
Phil  said if you wish he'll  his men on Saturday and Sunday.
Right well  don't have any papers on those but I thought we'd got more than that.
I thought we'd got I thought we could satisfy .
Friday, Monday and Tuesday.
Well, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, you're talking about nearly twelve thousand.
We're almost there  
Yes.
But that's wh that's your position at the moment isn't it?
That's how I take it.
We've got that on the computer, that came in  yesterday, that came in  wherever
Yeah.
and that came in  this morning.
Yeah.
That's the total we've got in at the moment.
We've got one thousand eight hundred and ninety at  and Eric checked and we've got nine hundred at the other place.
And they did another h eleven hundred and forty yesterday didn't they?
Well that's what he says they've got in stock at the moment.
Perhaps they've got more in transit Eric do you think?
Lorries on the road.
I don't know I don't know mate.
No.
I don't know.
I've got  a bit on that, if you want I could bring it up now while you're talking about it, I will.
Okay.
Pete while you're talking about  I've got I've I've got a quickie to bring up on that.
I've been on to this morning,asked me to and they have got thirty palettes there at the moment.
And they and they're working away.
What they say is they're getting no liaison at all when there's any lorries going in to pick any product up.
It would be lovely he said if somebody could give him a ring .
No  Let me just tell what is actually happening.
who are the main people
Yes.
Actually had a program of what is going through.
Yes.
So does Tim .
Yes.
I think it's a lack of communication  
Ah so it's their end, not our end.
yeah.
They have got a program of what's being pulled out as far as the trucks are concerned.
Yeah.
Dick got one, 's have got one.
The people at  have got one.
Everybody's got the schedule of what they pull out so .
Yesterday what actually happened was Yeah hang on a minute 
So it's only the poor bloke on-site who doesn't know?
What happened yesterday was, they had a breakdown again.
Yeah.
Right.
And they had three wagons turn up.
Yes.
And they couldn't load three wagons.
Yes.
They loaded I think one and two thirds.
Yeah.
And they had to send one wagon, because they couldn't load it, over to  to pick up some more  
Yes I see.
It's more  
So it it's yon end .
I think it's just Tim and and the other guy,
Okay.
cos he he does do a hundred and one jobs.
He's on .
Okay.
The breakdown was only for an hour and a half  the lorries turned up and the breakdown was happening .
But the information is there, just that 
said I've got a guy that's been stood here for an hour, don't know what to do with him..
What was this production here last night?
Yeah cos it was  
They didn't do anything really did they .
What happened was the the stuff didn't come in till quarter past four, the dust extraction didn't get done till after five, so we said, Right, from six this morning till they finish it, give me bags per hour and the run.
I've just timed
Hello.
Er instantaneous timing per bag fifteen seconds so that's about you know, it's two hundred odd an hour .
Do you want to .
Just a sec, hang on.
.
And I know they got to palletize them, wrap 'em and shift 'em and everything but er as our lot  more than .
Mm.
You know if they did .
But it's Brian I would like to see.
The calculation  it's not just the bagging, it's the bagging and the stacking .
Well what I'm saying though Ray is really everything downstream of 
the baggers should be able to cope shouldn't it.
You can get it through the sealers quickly and under the flattener.
Providing you can get it palletized and it's chucking men at it.
I wanna go out I'll go out there with Bryn and Eric anyway as soon as we've finished cos it wants .
As soon as it's finished I'll ring Joseph and get one .
Well ring him now then, see if he's got any .
The and then we'll let him know when .
There's always er Mr  if you want to drag him .
Well I could take him off line.
No.
Where is he?
I mean John.
Oh.
Oh.
I says to him I says, we're flexible here, you might find .
Erm the only other thing is, we've still got a spare man out on the  haven't we, covering the breaks.
We take him off and don't cover the breaks while you want him.
Right?
Well let's we'll go and have a look.
Yeah.
Me and Bryn and Eric .
.
There's not really much .
We had a breakdown  yesterday it was an hour and a half.
Apparently it was caused by dust getting in.
Dust got into one of the circuit breakers on the machine and apparently shorted it out.
electrician in .
Yeah that that was solved very quickly.
The problem with the truck you know about now.
The plan is today to i is still three loads, and we've got three loads planned for the rest of this week.
If they are double shifting it'll be on Monday.
Just whilst 
They've got through eleven hours today have they?
Yes that that  
We've definitely gone to eleven hours ?
Yes that's what he told me, he said we were going on to for the rest of the week, eleven hours and then start double shifting Monday.
Who's responsible for shipping it from  and  into here.
Who's the trigger, what's the trigger?
To bring it in.
Cos it doesn't It's not gonna  
I don't like the way you're looking at me.
We're the trigger we've got to try and schedule three pickups three baggings a day .
Three pickups a day.
Three a day.
Based on we can do they were doing sixty five palette loads a day.
three trucks would equate to sixty six approximately.
And is that to Phil to get his lot over is it?
I've asked Phil to bring his as he produces it, bring it over.
There's one in this morning I saw.
Has he.
Yeah.
Well it's just a question of him arranging the transport to get rid of it.
It's best if he arranges the transport cos he knows what's there.
Yeah.
Well I'll tell Phil then and no Saturdays but also get it  on a daily basis.
What's erm what are we gonna work here assuming this goes?
If it goes we're gonna bring the lads that finish at  lines three and four so it'll be what six six till, whenever you want, ten hours?
Twelve hours?
Well that'll be from Monday Lynne won't it?
From Monday yeah.
Yeah.
If you want  
I think that's alright for Monday.
Er no cos we're what we're gonna use the product that we've got in and you need some  don't you?
Definitely.
So what we're gonna do was do what Peter wanted and have from Monday, if you do want us to do it.
Cos again no decision, it's just yes we can do it.
We're just running out the material that we've got here.
I dunno Steve said yesterday he thought it was cheaper at .
They seem to be able to cope with it far better than anybody in this group at the moment don't they.
They're producing more than  
or well
It's not a sort of a long term thing.
I mean what's the position with ?
Well you've got the contract  finite number of bags.
I think if we went in again and tried to do another  .
They want the work I'll tell you that.
They want the work.
They want the work.
They're keen to do it a and if you want to make any more  it can be done but I think  
They was hoping  three months work then.
Yeah I don't think they're doing a great er I don't think they're making a great deal of money out of it themselves.
They're not.
Well he keeps  telling me that  he keeps saying .
.
Well can we not buy it  see where stocks lie.
Do we have to make a decision.
Now?
Well you've only got actually you've got 
Well no only that 
You've got five thousand bags here anyway.
The rest are out at  and  and you've got one load at   run that load through.
Oh yeah it makes sense to run that load through but whether What I'm saying is whether we go on next week to a continuous .
Well I think you have a look at what they're doing, the only thing is if if we say they need another bloke, if you're gonna do that next week, then you've gotta plan for that before next week .
That's the main problem What it is I'm ho we're holding fire 
the temps.
The temps  we're holding fire on them to know what to do with it.
If you want them on a coach , they'll be I think there's six up there is there?
Six  
Six so that means five five on a shift down here, we'll find something to do with them.
If not we're gonna double the shift back with the mixers.
We don't want to lose the men so we've got them here.
Yeah.
And we're saying, Yes you've got next week but we don't know where you are.
.
Yeah, that's why they're here and really I would like to know by  Friday m tennish.
Let's make a decision on Friday management meeting.
depending on what we've got out of by then.
What  's done .
Yeah.
What the breakdown situation is .
We need to look at  Bryn and Eric and just  tidy up the bits but see what they get off this then.
Yeah.
Today.
Yeah.
Get an idea of what  
Well let's leave that let's leave  
Yeah.
to Friday morning then.
So Friday  
So just flogging it to death
Yeah.
at the minute, we're waiting for some bits for this  should be in today.
Yeah yeah 
Yeah but we're that that would enable a double shift to be done  decide not to run a double shift  
Only because it would have meant stopping the pre-pack.
No it doesn't no no no that's what we've been
Prior to getting the  
Yeah yeah.
But that was why as I understood it, that was why I wanted the sealer.
Yeah.
Well Arthur wants the sealer anyway because if you're not doing  over there, you'll have double shift working on pre-packs.
So it still wants
I still want to get it going but I don't want to put a double shift onto  unless I have to.
.
pre-packs.
Mm.
The message I got was that  the last few days  it didn't matter a bugger what it cost but we were in desperate straights to get in stock.
What we're saying now really, that's not quite.
Well I'm saying I still don't know, the figures that I'm being given suggest that by Friday, erm or by Monday, we'll have sufficient  to meet the orders of .
The fifteen .
It's on there Steve, and the amount that  
The eighteen the allocation is eighteen thousand.
By Friday night we'll have sixteen thousand of those right.
Now that's the worst scenario given that you get five hundred a day out of 
Yeah.
and you get fourteen hundred a day out of.
Mm.
Now that would be the worst scenario .
they should do two thousand plus.
Then then okay, two thousand plus.
And then you've got however many you're gonna get off the line here between now and
Well you're gonna get whatever 
And  did seven hundred in el in eleven hours on Monday.
So they've upped slightly.
Seven hundred.
But they did four hundred last night  breakdown.
But we know  are going on to double shift on Monday
Yes it's eleven hours this week.
The problem is .
They should do
You'll get two thousand on Monday.
Yes.
and that's without going onto a double shift 
That's right.
at .
That's right.
That's why I'm saying let's wait while
I think so.
Friday and make a decision on Friday without panicking into a decision .
If things change in the meantime we could always
We could always ch we could always
Well we've got the o we've got the
You've got the option.
the people
Yeah.
and we've got the people here.
Why look for spending extra money when you don't need to?
Alright let's review at  but let's make a decision on Friday about what we do on the shift pattern on Monday.
Okay just before we go off Peter's erm the first comment you made Peter was about ten K Gs of 
Yes.
the computer says there was some and there isn't any .
Yes.
I think this is erm it it's an extremely worrying fact as far as I'm concerned, I got a phone call from Chris  just before this meeting.
He wants er to to get together with Ian and myself Ian  and myself straight after this meeting.
Because he's saying that the January stock take is quite is al is impossible to reconcile.
Bloody Hell.
He says he just can't backtrack.
He says there's so many differences .
Quite honestly Steve .
It's very difficult at this moment to say we're not talking about finished stock you know, you're gonna get fluctuations on product, but what worries me, I don't know at this stage how many tonnes of bone meal we've got stashed away somewhere or how many tonnes of  compost maker we've got stacked anywhere for use in the pre-pack.
Because that information is not in the computer at the moment.
Can I just  I think it's fairly important  that if we'd have actually done the reconciliation, last week, we'd have had the opportunity to recheck them.
Which wasn't possible because Chris was saying it wasn't possible to do.
We might not be in this situation now.
But I thought that er with  coming off that, Malcolm was going on to that.
Malcolm was doing part of it.
Sorry I'm not laying any criticism anywhere  
I know you're not Steve but all I'm saying is that we had a discussion about this earlier in the week.
Chris refuses to do something I'm afraid when somebody's already done three quarters of the work, you can't put somebody on to do the last quarter.
Mm.
And Chris was already inputting all of the data.
And when he was offered help he said, No, I will do it myself.
And we've been waiting and waiting and waiting now for a week to get this reconciliation at least together so that we could go out and re-count whatever was required.
Eric and myself went out and did a physical re-count last week of wha a whole bay of  because numbers weren't adding up.
Mm.
We went and did that ourselves  it needed that concerted effort.
And I'm not being funny but when Malcolm did it, we would do that almost two or three days after the stock taking if there were odd counts.
That's the question I asked this morning, Why wasn't it you know, why weren't we doing it?
And I think I think the reconciliation  what he's actually saying is he hasn't got time to recheck those reconciliations before this weekend's deadline  that's what it appears to be .
And that's that's not good enough.
No it's not, agreed.
And and Chris has just put his head in his hands and said I can't do it.
Mm.
It's not a matter of they're not reconcilable, I think there has to be a strong point that's made.
And I think Peter's been saying this for almost well since he's come back anyway that, I can't work because the stock figures have not been updated.
Monday's production's not in.
Tuesday's production's not in.
And I said to Chris, you know, I said to Chris yesterday, Are you putting in the production or have you put I can't do two jobs at once, I can't do two jobs at once and that was it.
So at five o'clock last night when I called down,I didn't respond.
I just ignored it.
At five o'clock I said to Chris I said, How about if I ask Cindy if she can help.
It's bugger all to do with me but my interest is getting the  in.
No!
No!
Now Cindy's saying to me, I can put it in.
Mm.
So if you if you're having words with Chris if you can say
Well I am.
If you you know
Well I think we we should  reaction was happening with Malcolm last week.
How Malcolm was asking how he could help
And you can't unfortunately take it away on block like I said, and give it to someone and say, finish it off.
and the other is, why should I clear up the mess that this guy's made.
Yeah.
I don't think it was a lousy stock take.
I think the the count etcetera went alright.
I think it's the reconciliation based on perhaps some of the problems that we had at the lost last stock take which are accelerated  You know probably the odd miscount here and there this time.
Mm.
I mean I looked through it this time.
Mm.
I mean I looked through it yesterday and th there are a few reconciliations which wouldn't take much sorting out.
Small ones.
There appear to be a lot jotted throughout, but they don't amount to a vast amount of money.
I d I don't know the problems at the moment.
I think it's worth looking at.
Yeah.
First actually.
Yeah perhaps that's yeah alright I'll retract that.
I don't know whether it was a lousy stock take or not.
The  the reconciliations  suggesting that it wasn't a good stock take.
Yeah.
When I was speaking t very very briefly erm to Ian before before I came down he said, well I'm really not surprised, the the the continuing problem and difficulty in establishing what's on the palette, as to whether it's lawn feed and weed, lawn feed and , for example.
And erm
Why should that be.
I think prob problems of identification haven't really been right this time and we made a point a clear point this time with a note to people, if they weren't sure, to make comments on the books.
I think if you look through the books, there are comments in there where they weren't sure, with question marks and they were to be rechecked.
The problem is it's not got to that stage yet.
Yeah.
I mean th that is that's crazy.
Absolutely yeah, I mean I and I I'll reiterate it and I'm not siding with Malcolm but two days after the stock taking they did prior to this one, we were out there rechecking.
Mm.
out rechecking  with Malcolm in cahoots to say, well show me where you counted these and let's do it again.
Yeah.
That's not happened, there's been absolutely zero coordination either  on a daily basis  here.
But Malcolm  Chris, have you got the numbers yet, have you got them crunched?
Oh well, I'll got to enter another few .
I I feel a bit sorry for for some of the counters because they can see certain on one palette for instance, I found there were three sorts of bags.
Just on one palette.
And if you didn't have the expertise to know Ah well I know what's in there, then what the hell does that person count  they've got to go and chase somebody to to find out
These were from erm from .
There was there was ten ten ten  bags, there was eleven five five ,
Ah right.
there was Spring and Summer and you thought well, what's what like you know we 
But as Ray said, all they got to do is query it haven't they.
Yeah but everything was queried You look at 
Oh the Yeah.
books and they were all queried.
I'm partly agreed with you the fact that the stock take at the end of the day we got it right, but all I'm saying it was very difficult
Difficult to count yeah.
And we could make it better by making sure that the bags came in more correct like what Simon's doing now with those printed labels.
Every bags gonna have a printed label on.
So 
Steve you were here on the day.
Mm.
We were supposed to start at six o'clock.
I mean some of us were in at six.
No no no it wasn't supposed to start at six, it was supposed to start at seven thirty.
No Chris should have been in at six, that's when the first team started counting.
Most of the teams that we'd organized that we sent notes round to start at seven thirty.
Yeah.
When you got in there at seven thirty, Chris wasn't there and the books weren't there and people were waiting around ready to get off.
It it wasn't organized well from that point of view.
I I'd asked Chris to organize it and it wasn't.
Okay.
I think the fact that the books were filled out correctly and I think you should give the people that did the stock take, congratulations because the books were filled out reasonably well considering some of their ex inexperience in it.
I think they did a good job on the day and they stayed until the counts were done.
In fact I do believe one team was here till about two thirty doing it
Yeah.
I know Chris was here doing doing his own calculations on  books but after that I mean the I think on the Sunday I he came in and did some work .
And then the stock stock take was dropped then for four or five days.
And we got Malcolm in to enter some of the input, we got Joe to enter some of the input.
But the final reconciliation has taken so long.
Mm.
Even after I mean, as I say, we went out on the Wednesday  and he said, all I need is for you to do this book again for me.
for God's sake.
I mean we did that on the Wednesday, and he said that's all I need now.
Monday it was.
And it's now
Straight after .
Middle of the following week and we got the first reconciliation yesterday.
Okay.
I I don't have anything further to bring up, there are no packaging issues .
.
Yeah erm just to clarify one thing, chutes and blockage up in chutes and s when the screen blocks up.
Who's job is it to dig it out or clean it out?
That's what I'd like to know cos there's a lot of confusion going on out there.
In terms of what Ray .
Well a lot of people out there think it's a fitter's job to clean chutes out and unblock screens.
I in my personal opinion I I don't think it is.
.
If you need tools to do it, then a fitter initially and then if the help comes from the people that are stuck because it's not working anyway, to help clean out.
Mm.
Well there's a prime example at the moment down the sedge hopper.
Which we call the sedge hopper on the  line.
Now I've looked at that this morning, we are getting spillage because the chute is that blocked up, there's that much polythene round the flail which we had a fire on before, down there and the stuff is piled right up, you can't even see the bottom tail drum.
And the conveyor that takes the stuff away.
Now you know, it's alright, we can't stop spillage, we never will stop spillage.
But I think we with the wet stuff we've had going through, the chute is blocking up.
And not getting cleaned out.
Pete got some cleaning up done last Saturday which is you know, round the er  screen, that area's all been cleaned up but obviously he ain't got enough blokes to to get the lot done.
clean them.
Well apparently so yeah.
Yeah.
.
Yeah, basically it's always been but it hasn't been enforced for quite some time, that the clean up rate is four pounds and hour which equates to six pound an hour on a Saturday.
Yeah, cos it's time and a half ?
Mm.
Now  erm when Paul came in he unfortunately come in and clean up come in and clean up and they were put on their own rate which they should never have been.
right l I'd said to Paul now have you told them it's .
Oh no I haven't.
So they got paid their own rate.
So they've been used to their own rate and I said each time, if you're gonna get  you must tell them it's the cleanup rate.
So probably three months went by where they got their own rate.
So I says to Pete, right, start as we mean to go on, I refuse to pay any more than the cleanup rate.
So he goes out there and they all turn round and say, stuff you, I'm not coming in to clean up for four pound and hour which again equates to six pound an hour.
So we got  Mark  I think was the only erm full timer off the compost plant that agreed to come in.
Mm.
And two or three temps and the rest were a couple of temps from the mixing plant.
Now Pete has said he's not gonna give in.
It's four pound an hour and it stands.
When Dick's lads are down to seven and a half hours which they are in the erm summertime, I mean we s the lads'll come in I mean we can't pull them off now, but those lads'll come in and clean up.
Permanent lads will come in and clean up.
But no they're just being damn awkward I'm sorry.
So Pete said, right, they're not gonna beat me, it's four pound an hour and that's it.
So they turn round and say, I'm not coming in.
But they'll come in if we want  cutting out and cos they get their own rate.
Well if they're going onto eight hour regular they'll probably  they'll probably still change their mind .
You see As I said, they might have just actually cut off their nose to spite their face .
Well they I think Yes I think they
really got to play them at their own game really.
and I'm sorry.
Mm.
It's been hard work for us but we're not giving in in here and that's it .
Oh it is, I mean I  that responsibility.
They they would come in mate if it was on their own rate but as soon as you.
There's a erm if there's a need for 'em to clean this Saturday, say  they need to clean round that sedge 
Well I I think there's a necessary to clean up this 
I I'll try and get a gang 
Well no, what you want to do, ask that same gang that came in last week,
I will.
and bugger the rest.
Yeah.
Ask those same blokes specifically  
I mean, I've had an offer from  who said I'll come in any Saturday but I can't take him off Dick cos Dick needs him there.
But when it comes to the 
you know, when all our temps are gone, then the first people that'll get asked are Dick's lads who've said, yes we'll do it, providing Dick doesn't want us.
I wouldn't I wouldn't give them the option, I would go and ask those same ones you had in last week.
As long as you've got somebody here that can
Underneath the screen up in the pie in the sky I mean that I mean I've known that when you've only got about that much where you should have that.
and it's maybe narrowed down to that.
Which the fitters'll take the side off for 'em,
Yeah.
but to get in to clean it out
What I might actually do it see if Ian's not doing anything if he not come in for the full time that they're cleaning up, but come in for those sort of things.
Well as long as the chutes get cleaned out 
you see that we're getting a lot behind that sleeper wall in between the packing line and the sleeper wall again.
I mean, an incident happened last week er the fitter went up They asked the fitter if they could track the belt up on the top.
So the lad went up and tracked it.
He come back to me he says, it's spilling over the top  because the chutes are blocked up he says I'll tell the track driver, the track driver says, Oh well get the  to clean that up.
I said, like hell you will.
Like hell you will.
I've had bloody platforms put up there to make it a lot easier for people to get up there.
I mean I could understand  when we had to climb up the belt which was damn dangerous, but now we've altered all that.
But they keep thinking I mean I've got like forty days holiday  my staff to get in in fif in fifty days left.
You know it's it's a problem.
Will you will you for Saturday though  do that, see Ian and make sure he knows what wants do what you think wants doing.
And make sure that he isolates the plant.
Ian did come in one Saturday 
for me last year and he and he did  Yeah I will see him 
Yeah we'll see if he'll come in and do something like that again.
Yeah.
You will see him before  
and have a word with him because he he knows what chutes is blocked up and what wants cleaning out.
But as I say, we can take the plates off the screen underneath here but I mean I think you still ought to have another bloke 
Well get together with Ian and sort of 
up there with him to clean it out because I say, you can isolate things but you're up in the air.
Yeah.
And that and that's what
Well as long as he knows what wants doing, as long as they're safe.
Well .
Erm I've been out as on the er line three this morning and I think there's another little bit we ought to buy but we'll discuss that as we're going on eh ?
Mm.
Erm  the U V A machine, the problem we've got on there which Ray's explained or Peter raised this morning, there is in between the the drive belts that take the film down the former and which They've put a new set on which is a hundred and forty pound a pi They're in between the two drive wheels, there is a plastic adjuster.
And what it does really is keep the belt firm so when it goes on the former it keeps it firm .
That is worn.
And one's been on er apparently I didn't know this but George showed me this morning.
Brian  made on and put on.
Well it ain't lasted.
I think it's only lasted about eight or ten weeks.
And it's worn.
So what I'm doing now I've got one of the lads down at er  Plastics
Mm.
Yes they have got some stuff, yes he's gonna get a price to make some on this hard plastic that we've got on the .
Mm.
Erm which I think that's gonna solve one of the problems.
It's gonna be cheaper doing it that way than going through U V A .
U V A yeah.
Erm as I say but but that is on there.
Now the mix-up we had yesterday, er on a lot of aggro when I got  about this dust extract system one line three.
I don't know whether people think they can move a dust extract  in an hour or two hours.
Er we're limited with people and while Brian  was in the verge of moving it which the electrics all had to be took out and rerun, he got called away, down to the pre-packs to a breakdown so obviously it didn't get done, the job stopped cos there's nobody else.
When I come back in, things was all up in the air because while he was moving the first position of the dust extractor, there's a radio there.
And we'd  squared it up once before  because there was wires hanging all over from the sp not from the radio, from the speakers.
And we asked them to tie it up, the lads made a bloody job I think they tied it up for  coming round.
Which they did do, but yesterday when Brian went to move the dust extractor that the radio was at the side of, there was wires hanging again like bloody clothes line again.
So straight away he said, that's it I I'll condemn it.
And that's when he lost cooperation with the workers out there.
They buggered him about apparently.
Went and signed the forklift off and signed the keys out and generally
Well he was moving with the forklift, their forklift and he come back and he says  
Pete was out there and I know a lot of tempers got frayed.
Yeah  
said I walked away.
Yes quite right .
It was it was personalities
Yeah.
more than anything.
And I said to Brian you know he's 
Out there wasn't it yesterday.
you know I did say to Brian
Yeah well at the end of the day I mean I I wasn't there but a the facts at the end of the day were that they'd been buggering about with that radio system which they shouldn't do.
No.
So I said to Brian, right leave it.
I think the best thing there would be to leave it for a week,
Yeah.
let 'em have it back
Yeah.
on condition that they don't do anything silly with it.
That way Brian's had his  they've got their 
It's yeah yeah 
radio back and everything should be status quo.
Yeah.
But they shouldn't do that.
They're not they aren't allowed they aren't qualified to bugger about with  
Well that have actually been told that if anything comes in providing This is what I can't get through We've said to them you can bring your radios in but give to Brian first.
To check.
Let Brian check them 
It's not  the radio though it's not 
They they've put some speakers on it haven't they.
They  bloody speakers all over the place.
I mean the mixer's just as bad but really we've got on to them Brian did and they made a good job, they squared it up.
But I mean I mean we still walk round  there's wires hanging and connectors .
Mm.
Now .
Well it shouldn't be done anyway.
It shouldn't be done  
End of story as far as I'm concerned.
But I think I think it was the way maybe the way Brian approached them you know, I think there's a little bit on both sides 
But it was a bit of Yeah.
To come back in and get  bloody aggro like that and it's you know and it
Brian'd be under stress anyway having to move that er dust extractor quickly and he's 
Well he got called away.
had to go to a breakdown, the poor bloke didn't know whether he was coming or going so one of these situations that stress stress arrives.
Yeah but as I say I just want to make it clear to people that it's er it's a bit of both and I think a bit of bit of heated argument was
This morning they're different again down there cos I've been down there and I've looked at the situation erm and I've had a word with the lads there and I will try and alter it a little bit more.
Which I'm g 
Give them a week then and give them their radio back then.
I gave them some er jackets and trousers that I got in stock down there that's that's that's it then yeah .
I see.
er us I went to  yesterday the the the borehole is now fully covered in secure er and the water system is working well.
I  as well but he's still a load of water on the top.
A lot of water.
Did you get the .
Took it home last night  .
He took it home last night I w I got it going I got the time on it but I
He couldn't find an eleven year old kid to do it.
Because it's like an M F I.
Y all you need is an eleven year old kid, you can't do it can you.
take it home and sort it out.
Well apparently Paul his his erm his mate up there he's done works on the B T so he'll set it for him.
Nobody works for B T.
Only the buggers that send the bills out.
While I was there we had the council man there.
And he he wasn't he said  they can only stand the water problem so long so what they can do with it I don't know.
I keep saying I said to Dennis, well it's on our property.
There will be a report coming through because the chap from the council believe it or not, said, Oh this should be undercover.
and it's true it's right.
Dennis said, I've got asthma, you're not putting this under cover.
But I mean when I went  going towards  they were screening it you know, seeing it.
It was .
water on then.
Yeah.
Well you see you you don't put water on when you put  screening system
No.
it's when it comes through isn't it.
the stuff that they're using now is crap it's nothing like 
it once was it's just so it's just absolute dust.
Sawdust isn't it.
Well when Tom  
It's wo it's p It's not actually sawdust it's wood flour.
It is yeah.
Absolutely crap Yeah it's nothing like it was I mean 
why you know what I don't know what's changed in the meantime or whether we're paying different rates or whatever, but if you take the material that we were getting in two three years ago when first time I was involved, it's just absolutely nothing like.
And there's no wonder it's blowing away cos it's just lighter than air.
I mean in terms of stock 
Well it is  you're right.
in stock out
I shudder to think.
I mean yesterday was yesterday really was there wasn't a deal of wind at all but  bloody sandstorm  
If it dries up for three or four days  it's st dries up for three or four days and Dennis has to stop  the minute he picks it up it's just blown away.
That's right, you get so much in the hopper you get seventy five percent 
Yeah and it's blown away.
in the hopper whup and then the rest is in the field.
Well that's the first first I've heard about the change to it.
Do you want to samples bringing d Pete's going up on
Tomorrow.
Yeah Pete's going up tomorrow do you want some 
Who's responsible who's responsible  
Who buys the timber?
who buys the D I Y.
Well it's bought in it was an original contract that was  but we buy it through here.
We set the contract up.
Technology.
Technology.
Mm.
It's been going ongoing for eighteen months two years  change it  
Do you want some samples bringing down 
Tom Tom Tom knows what it's like cos last time I was up there  yesterday Tom was and Chris Turner was up there and we went past an heap and it and we said is that a lorry-load and Dennis said, well it was at  this morning.
I've got some original samples down here
what's changed is that they in in the early days we used to get the offcuts and they they were ideally they used to put those through a hogger which is a thing that breaks it down and it's these it's worktops 
Yeah.
Yeah.
that they break down.
So you end up with a particle if you look at that it's particles about two or three mills square.
And then what they used to put with that on each of the machines that have dust extract system.
So if they were where the machine was planing or moulding or whatever, the material'd be sucked away like ours is into bins and then that used to go with the material we used to get.
And that would be finer.
The way it looks now as if somebody else is getting the material that was the lumps  maybe that's going to  er what's his name  Technology and we're getting the crap, we're getting dust.
Was there a specification set at the beginning do you know on this  
Hardly there's hardly anything There's hardly anything written down at all about this.
Sorry.
I've got a deal in writing  this.
As far as the specification's concerned I mean obviously  I think it says something very simple like D I Y wood waste  
Yeah I d I think there's hardly anything in writing.
I did in December but it was not relative to any of the specifications it was simply to try and ascertain how long the contract was was still live, to find out  get this guy  
Well according to Barry  of  Technology it doesn't finish it's ongoing .
Arthur erm Arthur actually met with him as well on that particular day.
Mm.
But there was no talk at the time about .
I think what you and I ought to do is sit down we ought to list  the pros and cons and problems of and look at them afresh and then maybe talk to Tom anyway.
What vis a vis 
Well  Well if you take the site as a whole I mean there are numerous problems.
They've got a problem at the minute where the electrics aren't very good .
Yeah.
You've got the fact that you  we're paying Dennis but we don't employ Dennis you know he's he's so there there's the extra cost there  what you wouldn't have anywhere else.
Hello?
The things that they
Yes.
The implications that are onto that and we've got .
I'm just in a meeting at the minute.
And really  
coming over at dinner.
I mean tea break.
You've just got back.
I'll give you a ring when I've finished then.
Alright .
What's the difference between  I jotted down this morning.
We've got According to the information I've been given we've got seven thousand cubic metres of  which is useful
no this is processed D I Y.
Well according to Dennis he thinks it's eight thousand.
Alright, seven to eight thousand.
Yeah.
We've got nine thousand of raw material not processed.
Yeah.
The  takes it to twel it's a twelve week cycle isn't it?
Yeah.
So we have four, five six, seven, eight, nine  we haven't even got enough to see us  through the next twelve months.
But
Twelve weeks.
But out of this out of that seven thousand  some are s weeks plus.
Some  already been down four weeks, five weeks six weeks .
What of the eight thousand cubic metres.
Yeah now
I'm assuming that's twelve weeks is it?
Is that
Yeah.
Th the the eight the processed one are twelve weeks ready to go out the door.
That's twelve weeks.
Now I have I've asked Dennis and Chris  's insisted that he deals with it so Chris  has taken it over, and Dennis is getting back to Chris with the stockpiles of how much is ten weeks old, eleven you know so so you 
Right so the the nine thousand raw material not processed, in fact some of it's processed in various stages of 
Some wh is ready Yeah some is is on the road to being processed.
I had a word with Tom  yesterday, it was me who brought this up.
I was concerned, Dennis has never been given any schedule since he last spoke to erm Arthur which was get as much down as you can boy.
I mean it was like that.
He works like that.
Now I was concerned that nobody although they were looking at the water, they were looking at the borehole, they were looking at the electric, nobody was actually looking at production up there.
And where we stood.
So I said, Tom, like I says to Tom.
He then said, right you ring Dennis, get the stockpiles and wha Cos apparently Paul used to flag them.
Yes.
He started a system of flags didn't he.
Mm Yeah.
He puts the date that it's laid down and then he knows how many weeks you know, this is ready in three weeks time.
So then  Tom had a word with Chris  and Chris  insisted that he did it.
Because he's got a plan of the site so he wants to know with his little squares, what's what.
And Dennis is now going straight back to Chris  and he's going to give him
So he's probably got it now.
it's  D I Y really not a  function I don't think.
Not in terms of controlling what's down there and what's mulching.
They they all that we can do is to  
That needs to be more production yes.
specification if we know what it's meant to 
Which is  since we had him here last time but we just ain't had time to get it do by .
And also he's dropping in with unnecessary and you know, when I'm short staffed.
I think the think is though if you're not careful .
Well it is and I'm going concerned I mean it's I mean it's like now I mean th we've got leaking taps and plugs missing, I've got toilet rolls  
What you wanna do is I've just done a seven day report on the er on hazard spotting etcetera etcetera etcetera and all the different surveys we've had on the site over the past month.
Mm.
Plus risk management meetings, works committee meetings, work from.
I think we can keep 'em going another week anyway.
You've got another you've got another report coming  from .
Well I mean I yeah.
I think what you want to do now , write down a list of what you want him to do and let Steve do that for tomorrow if you can and then let's see if we can make him stick to that list cos otherwise he'll be here in 
another fortnight saying can I give another fortnight.
When we get this list typed up that Joanne's doing at the moment,
Yeah.
then you probably  have to take it from that and I think you'll find there's a weeks work on there.
I'll .
And now we're doing  down the pre-packs on the Saturday, apparently that's coming off my budget.
The hours are being .
Yeah.
George's hours are in the pre-pack.
Yeah because they they
They are not in your maintenance budget.
They're not on my budget.
No.
I left his hours in the pre-pack 
I think this is quite interesting  
The only one that's gone down to yours is Bill  last week for those four and a half hours doing that interceptor.
That's the only thing I've charged to you.
All the rest has been kept by myself .
So I've got something spare now.
piece of metal put up over the entrance to the compost plant please.
It's gonna be like Omen two one day.
bloody decapitated.
What do you mean, shut them big doors and lock 'em?
No just the piece of corrugated iron that's just about to drop off
No it's not dropping off.
Now be be sure that it's all in the pre-packs, it's been taken by the pre-pack department 
Yeah.
Yeah.
and it's not gone to yours.
Anyway who who do you think's gonna stand my pay while I'm ?
Yeah.
Eh you've got .
You've got it all now.
Er now that is another thing Peter about that hanging sheet.
But have you seen the state of the doorway what somebody's clobbered.
Can't blame me  
Have you seen it?
That bay three doorway.
No the big doors?
And they've clouted it from the outside going in.
Could that be a lorry reversing in to tip sand and grits in it?
Don't know.
sand and grit bay's this way not that way.
But er that I mean and then there's  that's another thing we ought to look round, there's the state of the shed outside 
on the r main road.
Yes yeah it's not very good.
It's not
It wasn't very good in nineteen eighty four.
Well somebody else has clobbered it now ain't they further down.
Have they?
Yeah.
But anyway that's all my moans and groans this morning.
you know there was something wrong I was sitting listening I mean I'm not been involved when you were talking about the stock take  somewhere along the line a few things have slipped because when you go back, in the days when I used to be morning stock takes, we used to before the event, you would nearly always have the counts done.
I'm thinking now, the areas I used to do, the prepacks.
I used to really go down there and all I did was sort of tick off what the lads had already done.
Cos  used to tell 'em when it was gonna be and they would have time before the event to get it all tidied up, it was all ready, he would in and say, there's such and such on that one, such and such on this one 
A four letter word Dick, time.
And he would you would really only have to verify because at the end of the day what you said about You you mentioned somewhere along there Ray about given the fact that they were inexperienced.
And that's a problem because you really want the blokes counting who are used to counting 
Precisely.
because otherwise you or I can only take your best estimate.
Oh aye  
If if if you have the people doing it who know what they're doing you've really only got to look at what they're counting.
in fairness, the people what did it 
Well yeah I mean bear in mind bear in mind you've got a week's notice to put one together.
Mm.
The most people that we could get together in a weeks notice, we have to put the actual amalgamation of the team  
Yeah I'm not I'm not 
over to someone else anyway.
And  Malcolm sorted that out as you know.
Yeah I'm not criticizing that.
What I'm saying is 
We did the best we could  
that maybe it shouldn't have been a we a weeks notice then.
Yeah.
Correct but even The one prior to that which was apparently wrong which I think a lot of things were reconciled 
Well we don't know whether it was wrong or not do we?
No exactly but I think prior to that, we did do what you're suggesting, we did go round all the areas, Dick, myself and Malcolm and Chris, walked round all the areas, told told the people what needed tidying up to go in the  it was before we had the racking up by the way so it was more messy 
Yeah yeah  
down there.
And we tidied those areas up and we went round and said right, the people with the problem areas, take 'em round and show them.
We designated the areas, we chalked 'em off, we did as much as we could pre-prep.
This time there wasn't time to go round and do that.
Mm.
Malcolm, myself and Chris went round I think it was two days before, looked for the  well it's a lot tidier that it was the previous time because of the new racking.
Mm.
It is easier to count, there's not so much in the aisles as there were.
The problem area's going to be the yard because we didn't have enough people to count the yard.
We wanted to split it into three,
Mm.
we had to split it into two.
I volunteered then to do one of the yards because you know, you're asking other people to do it, it was gonna be a nightmare.
And you did have the odd team of people like Don and Tina who o obviously hadn't done things before.
But most of the teams
That was hardly  
Sorry.
They  scribes, but even then if you've got somebody climbing up the top of a palette, shouting  
The people were They was only scribes  people I mean 
what's on a palette.
Yeah but we spent three hours, Lynne, Malcolm, myself sorting that list out and everybody what was on the stock take 
Who was 
worked in that area.
I mean it
It we we actually got the expertise and the people.
We we had problems because there wasn't an awful lot we had the good old ones back again.
We had Loretta and Wendy and Terry , they'll come and do it.
A lot of 'em you know  where's Mr .
But I mean you know, we didn't have much.
I've got a lot in reserve, you've got a  
I honestly had to bully Eric  to get a list.
I r You had a word with him didn't you?
Mm.
So I rang him a bit later, Now look, we've got a weeks notice, we know it's gonna take some time.
So I rang him up I said, Eric I haven't had time to ask anybody, I thought, well I'll bloody come down and ask you then.
We got that much cooperation from up there didn't we.
I mean Tina said,I I haven't done it before but if you need a scribe, I'll come in.
And we had people coming back after they'd actually done their run out there saying, Do you want any help with  I mean that's what we asked them for 
Yeah we had a lot of people offering help.
and they gave it.
So I mean a as a team it wasn't really a problem at the end of the day.
We ran short of numbers to do it if you like, from seven thirty to to twelve initially, in terms of the original count and the original people  when they'd finished their count.
But if that that was only I was gonna say the other thing, when you're talking about damage you know, at one time I would suggest that a good many years, you wouldn't see any damage out there.
No no.
And something's changed in the intervening time, I mean I know there's aggravation and times are hard, I know we've cut back on the hours and the rest, but there's a lot  of things that aren't good .
There's a lot more going out the gate for a start Stu.
Oh yeah yeah.
There's a lot hell of a lot more going out the gate
Yeah.
and it ain't coming in the gate.
Yeah but we've had we've had times before Peter when there's been huge  pressure.
Thanks Bryn I think you've proved the point really by the the length of these meetings.
O normally a meeting of this type should take twenty minutes.
Mm.
Because because there's so many there's so many things that are going on at the moment that it it does take time.
Primarily because it's that time of the year when things will start going bad.
We're just at the beginning of it and this is going to go on till the end of April or May now, it'll be like this.
Chaos.
Cos it's that sort of business.
Well no  
Well  I don't think it needs to be.
That I know we're flogging a dead horse, but that  half past ten, a phenomenal amount of time, it should never ever have taken a fraction of that if it had been done properly.
Well how many weeks Stuart have we been talking in here about bre You wouldn't know because you haven't been in here.
But we've been talking about it for three four months .
Every day.
There's water on the site, bloody, there's a borehole problem.
Mm.
He's gotta get a generator.
And it goes round and around and around and around.
Well it's true .
And the same things are spoken about every day.
Mm.
Yeah but you may spend that bloody  standing at end of a bloody airfield here thinking nothing's been done .
No no no Bryn I'm just saying  you know, the reason the meetings are going on 
But there is I mean I've assured him that things are being done.
But it takes time.
bring the same things up.
all these massive problems that  end result .
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.
But as I say  
I mean I  I accept what they say that you
That's right I mean the the I mean
It's part of  isn't it that's .
Hello.
Okay.
But I mean   
finish 
this idea pettiness you know, but you're just waiting while they get their load done, to come up with some suggestion.
I mean that might be er a solution to our water problem.
I've spoken to him  yesterday
You did?
Yeah, I've spoken to Tom, he wants me to get an outline price which I'll do today.
.
Okay Bryn let's get on.
Yeah that's alright.
Eric.
.
And that's about I think that's about w vaguely covered everything.
Apart from one thing, the the lads out at   taking this .
Apparently when they're not on the lines, there's .
And they're doing a pretty good out there for us and Ray went out there  
Cos they're restacking all the other stuff.
Re-palleting about ten thousand bales 
Re-palletizing it all.
So when it actually comes it's gonna be a lot cheaper cos we're not gonna send the lads up.
You  you do.
It is bless 'em.
I mean you know how much it costs don't you, for me to send those lads up there, we worked it out Steve.
Now hopefully, Dick said they're palletizing while they're waiting for the containers they're also palletizing the rest of that stuff.
So can we give 'em some bonus for their work up there.
Can we have some bonus.
How are you gonna work that out?
.
I might as well be  
It's what we used to do if we took them off a line and got them cleaning up, it's a token  tow pound ten a day.
Yeah.
Ten pound fifty the week.
Yeah.
Please.
Mm.
Thank you.
Is everything still alright up there Eric?
Yeah it's going fine sir, yeah.
Going fine.
And is there a chance we'll give a little bit extra for the hour to  cos he's organized it, he's taken 
Yeah 
he's not the charge hand, he's taken charge, he's taken responsibility.
Something like the line leader rate.
Which is about ten pence an hour extra.
Is he gonna on Friday  have have fax both to er  and to erm  s s s to fetch the elevator and the generator the generator away .
Yeah yeah.
I'll I'll ask Mark to stay there while while they're collecting it.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah that's okay.
He should be that lot  three anyway.
Yeah.
Well I could always ring  and ask them to get the container up here earlier on  Friday you see so
Well whatever time you say.
if I say if I say three  
Well you can make it three if you want.
We'll be finished with it at three.
Right then I'll tell them three.
Cos I mean, the generator's not a problem anyway.
Re Oh it is for the  
Yeah I was thinking of the lights and them  we hardly use the lights.
Saturday because Mark  Mark  
Three of us  
What about bringing your own lights  
make sure everything is safe for the containers to come in.
So that's already gone through..
Yeah well that what about your elevator  sort that out next week or is it
Are you leaving the elevator up here?
Well  no it doesn't  container  we don't want 
the other one back you see.
Yeah.
We shan't nee the other one  
Well so that one's got to go back to back to Cambridge then hasn't it.
Yeah I've arranged that but i if the lights if erm 
Well  caravan weren't we.
three months time.
Well you won't get 'em in in er
So three o'clock Friday then we ought to be  the lights before I suppose.
Yeah.
Can't we?
Oh yeah you can fetch the lights.
You can fetch the lights Friday morning, seven o'clock Friday morning .
How many more consignments are like that Steve?
Eh?
How many more lots like that?
How many more lots have come in?
Equivalent to what we've had.
Erm we've had
It'd be about.
What have we had, we've had twenty twenty footers in.
Yeah.
Twenty.
that's twenty five, twenty, fifty five.
Erm equivalent of fifty five twenty footers.
So two and a half times as much again.
It was about twenty five more 
Yeah two and half  two and half time.
So about another er two two and a half weeks then, maybe a bit less.
Maybe doing two weeks.
Well I think  Yeah we could put it up to three a day we'll got  cos there isn't quite so much messing about you know.
We could certainly go for three .
When you say you want ,will it do a forty footer?
No it'll go twenty foot.
.
Yeah but i yeah but I mean.
seven people here doing it .
No.
It'll go about fifteen foot into the .
It's just whether it's worth having the hire for that one doing forty foot.
Well I think the one we've got is actually longer than the one you've got.
I've never seen it fully extended actually so I
forty foot.
Yeah well it probably will be cos but it I mean they've never had to go to that extension have they?
You see, with it being twenty foot, so so I've never seen it fully extended.
Okay yeah.
Yeah I've just got When  
this by the way when you've finished.
Right, a few problems yesterday, a forklift and trailer keys not being signed in and I had  taking them home.
Yeah.
Pete says nobody's pointed a finger, can we get big fobs on like hotel keys so they don't take the damn things home or leave them in their pockets.
Or if you
Yeah you're right I mean
Can we have big fobs on them or something so as they don't put the bloody things in their pockets?
.
Can you put that on his list for next week?
Yeah er yeah it is a good idea.
Right, Ian  concerned that  are hauling in  grain into brig then loading six five thirty five.
Apparently according to we are supposed to grain free t certificates.
Yes.
we haven't seen one yet.
Yeah but it's in hand.
That's alright.
's slinging a bit of shit.
That's alright.
Just for a change.
Bless him.
Right, there's one for you.
got that sorted he was speaking to Guy yesterday and apparently if after two days we don't have certificates then I  
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah it'll be about five minutes and then he'll be down.
Alright .
Check with him  communicated that with Ian  
Some problem I think on line three.
Can you go down when we've finished.
Right we're going down in a minute, yeah.
Stu Ste erm Pete said the erm hopper nineteen, have any answers, anything been thought on that one?
Well he's supposed to be testing it.
left it with er
Well he's put it on here  give me an answer on what steps we should carry out on hopper nineteen.
Which is now empty or is it a sloop bed problem?
So you want them to do
No I'll see him .
Will you?
I thought they'd done it because Ray I asked a question the other morning in the Tardis, cos it was on the board.
You know they set out what  
Yeah.
And I says to Ray, aren't we using hopper nineteen?
He says, Yeah I've just used it, worked perfectly.
Apparently he did use it but with a different he didn't put nutrients in it did he.
I don't know I don't know  
No apparently there's no problem at all.
test with it It was all arranged I thought, testing  to see what weight they got  
Can you just please.
And oh  probably after this meeting, not now, apparently Peter  came and see me about samples procedure, I E marketing.
So you, me, Dick cos we're the ones that it's it's gonna be somebody they're gonna pull off aren't they, to do these samples.
Maybe Brian  but what they want is initial contact point  for somebody.
Samples for what?
Marketing samples.
Well they haven't got anybody marketing have they?
They pull on
Well  that's debatable I think they've got plenty of people up here to do it it's just that they don't want to do it .
What about the young girl they got up here?young girl's here.
Isn't she there one day a week?
I've no idea.
Probably  what what they'll be calling for is empty packaging, erm you know what it's like, pristine condition, samples for sales that go out you know, to customers.
I mean, the answer is that somebody's got to have a bit of experience to do it.
It's not .
What's that got to do with Peter  then?
Well it's go apparently there's got to be a procedure .
It to be  five seven five O.
Hello?
Sorry Phil?
It's only ten past ten.
Okay  thanks.
So again after this meeting cos I want to tie it up.
It's gonna
Yeah sometime.
Peter's whingeing that he wants
Peter?
.

Right, any comments, then on on this 
No, I thought it was alright.
Thank you.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yes, works quite well.
I thought it was quite funny as well.
Er, do you think the language is actually the language that  would use.
Yeah.
I I've used, in my script I've used a very loose language, like  er, very, er, well, non-standard English then, because they now,erm, you know,especially after having it banned.
my experience.
So do you think this is loose enough, though.
Yeah, this is fine.
you know, I think there's erm room for like, people being able to make up bits as well.
Yeah.
Not  like,you're not, it's not the way they s , like, phrase it,put a sentence together.
No.
As the way they're saying 
To be quite honest man, I've never really, never really did see a problem.
If they're gonna be that type of band, they're not gonna be, thinking as how they pronounce a sentence.
Is that  
How they've portrayed a excellent 
It's like in in in in in interviews as well, like you don't,som some people do but, if somebody asks you a question, you just try and answer it, you don't really think about, erm, the way you construct everything.
No.
Isn't this  
No.
A lot of these people  English.
Yeah but.
Isn't this  isn't this language a bit stereotypical of the band?
It doesn't really matter who that is.
I feel like
It's true but 
If they, if they can't speak properly, they haven't got much chance of writing a song.
I mean  some lyrics are pretty inane, aren't they.
Yeah.
It's
I think they're clever.
Well, they're clever in one respect, but they're not necessarily clever with words.
Yeah, well some of, some people can't really er, communicate, can't converse with er, people in normal conversation, but, er, when it comes to writing stuff down, you know, they can be very good.
Or they can converse in a sense that they can get a chord progression or a melody together that actually works, and says something, irregardless of the words.
Exactly.
The words are often the last thing that, or sometimes the last thing that people actually write.
And this, I mean, this isn't meant to be a good band anyway, is it?
Is that  
The fact that they can't communicate, or they don't speak, or whatever, is something to do with.
I suppose 
Yeah, but just because they're a rubbish band, doesn't mean that they can't communicate, and that's sort of the image that we're portraying here.
Or isn't that bit  s s stereotypical.
So, so what.
What's the matter with words 
I don't know, I just think, I just think 
What's the problem.
No, there's no problem, I'm just like, saying that, they sound really thick, they're rubbish  at being in a band, and it's just all so down-hill for them from the beginning, really, they didn't really have a chance, did they.
Exactly.
Exactly.
gotta have high hopes to start with.
Yeah.
But they don't that.
have high hopes.
Yeah, but they they just are are, they're just rubbish.
You know, they just, they they just not fated to be in a band, at all.
No.
Have you seen the Graham Taylor documentary?
He had to bring football into it didn't he?
Well, it's it's not exactly football it's just like a tragic downful slide, isn't it.
Er, I just think that th the the language is a bit too, sort of, proper, and that, you know, they have, you know.
He couldn't play the drums, he was too loud, that sounds too formal  you know, say, he was crap at the drums, couldn't they,
Yeah.
or,
what would they say these days about you know the drum.
I mean, in in, sort of colloquial language,wh what would they say.
I think, you'd be surprised  here, I do, with how the bands speak at like, especially on a rockumentary on T V.
Yeah.
you wouldn't think that they were a band like, you can tell they were on drugs, some of them.
Yeah.
The way they speak, you wouldn't.
So their language isn't  basic.
No, it just terrible, no.
You know, there's ever hardly ever any swearing 
They're probably not allowed to show it, are they.
Exactly, they're not, they wan they're being interviewed for television, they can't be probably their normal selves, can they.
Well, that's what this is, isn't it.
Exactly, same as 
All ages.
Yeah well of course.
Famous people, you'd be surprised, people just erm, switch into a different like, mode, when they're being  erm, filmed for, you know, cameras and everything.
Or recorded.
Exactly.
So the they got to erm, watch everything they say.
Do you reckon that er, word at the  top there,incon incompatibility
Is that is that the kind of word that you would use about er
That would be used by the interviewer.
Would there be an official reason.
What.
Are there usually official reasons 
Well, I heard a lot of peoples 
Got bored with being together.
Sorry.
They become bored with being together.
They just,if they,
if they don't get on,
give up 
Exactly, they're incompatible.
Mm.
Yeah.
This is, whether it's the word they'd use, or whether
Yeah, but they wouldn't use it, their manager or something like that, would say  
Their agent.
Their agent, yeah.
Not that  they'd have one  but
Yeah, well they might have one
So, so possibly that ough ought to say,the their agent described it as
Yeah.
the reason as being incompatibility.
That, you know,th that puts it more in the context, doesn't it.
Mm.
It's what we mean by the official reason, it it's the P R person.
Yeah, yeah, it's the reason we give to the paper, or whatever.
Yeah.
The local paper.
It was in the press release, you know.
That kind of thing.
Probably wouldn't have really mattered why they split up if they were  that rubbish to start with.
Yeah, well they're making a big deal out of it aren't they?
if their first gig was 
Hopeless, or rubbish as to put it, yeah.
Who would really, who would really mind.
Well, if you're doing a erm, a rockumentary about them, somebody must mind, mustn't they.
Yeah, you've got to have a reason for that.
But if you, if we're doing a rockumentary about the whole  got to cover for whole, whole  scene.
We've got to do, how they started, whatever.
You can't just leave it open at the end.
Some somebody must be interested, otherwise we wouldn't be doing this  theoretically.
I mean, sometimes a band can be so bad, but they're really interesting, cos they're so bad.
Does that make 
Yeah.
I mean, you look at the Sex Pistols, for example.
I mean they were  pretty awful weren't they in any sort of, musical sense, but they were so outrageous  outrageously bad in some respects as well.
a good guitar player though in the Sex Pistols.
Ah.
I know when he played, he used to play it with his fists, but erm,
Nice day.
It is a nice day, actually.
quite fresh.
Yeah.
So let's, let's just talk about, we've had a look at this one, basically we're we're sort of happy enough with this, aren't we.
Yeah.
Gonna see how,per haps perhaps fits in with the other  erm bits, so  who's starting off, you're starting off aren't you?
I'm starting off, yes.
So tell us, tell us what happens.
Well.
Just have a quick, sort of chat about  where we're going, whether it's you know, whether 
Well, in the beginning, erm, this is an interview before they start rehearsing one evening, or like, what they  each other play, and they're just talking about how they met and everything, cos they, the vocalist and the guitarist met in a chip shop, and knocked all the chips everywhere, and then he er, the guitarist talks about, erm, he met, I mean, he knows a drummer that's free and it turns out that it's the vo vocalist's vocalist's brother.
Although she didn't know he played the drums at all,
No.
she just like thought he was, being a carpenter or something, and this brother, erm, her brother didn't know that she sung at all, so it all turns out to be a big surprise.
Loads of coincidences.
Yes.
I think that's, that's pretty consistent, probably with how bands are formed, actually, isn't it, its friends of friends, and somebody knows somebody else, and somebody's looking round for a drummer, just happens that somebody mentions it to somebody else.
Tends to happen that way, doesn't it.
Yeah.
They just grabbed this bloke who's standing outside the music area, thinking he might be a musician and he isn't, but it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
That's it really, and they just tell them how they meet and everything.
And which character's that.
Or are they just a crowd.
Oh, that's the bassist
So is that, er, I mean, in the in the characterisation we've got, is is there particular personalities coming through here, because I think that's one of the other things we need to make sure in the script, that we've got a consistent view of certain personalities.
The thing is because, yeah, but because we're all doing different scripts 
That's right.
We're portra , we're doing our own personalities for 
Yeah.
each character, so 
I know.
they're bound to differ.
But they've got to have to be consistent,
Yeah.
cos that's how, that's why we've got to ultimately look at all the scripts, and sort of,
Yes.
change them, to make them all consistent.
Tie them all in.
Yeah, I mean, Joe's starting it off, so, have you got a particular  personalities for the characters.
Who's the sort of ringleader here?
I mean,
Yeah yeah well I think er,th the vocalist is one of, one of the main people, she's very su sure, you know, of her ability, you know, despite, you know, actual, or reality anyway
Yeah.
Erm, the gui the guitarist is very erm  erm, how can I put it, erm 
Arrogant?
Arrogant, yes, yes.
Did you just say 
Has got to be, like, the leader?
Yeah.
Well in this I've got her as the, dim twit.
Oh, no, that's, that's the drummer, that's the drummer.
Actual  of the band.
I've got her as.
Well, the drummer's pretty erm,
Yeah.
stupid really.
The drummer's th the very stupid one, and the bassist basically can't be bothered at all, you know .
As long as that's like, is the bassist James or
Yes.
Ken, Ken's the guitarist.
Ken's the cocky one.
Yeah.
The bassist just can't be bothered.
And the drummer takes everything personally, he's very er, but takes like fits and can't really see what's going on.
Well, this , would he take it all personally?
Erm, he well he 
He doesn't really understand, that's why 
He he doesn't understand, it's all going over his head.
Doesn't really care.
Okay, so that's the first scene, and then we move to  to
Number three.
three.
I think.
Demo isn't it.
No, it's the Rock Gala, isn't it.
Yeah, recording demo's number two.
Yeah, recording demo 
Recording demo.
Okay, let's see what, see what 
Right, we've got they go over to the studios and start recording.
Three of the group members turn up, but one was late.
Okay, and that one happens to be  Ethel Bethel.
That's yeah, that's consistent, I think, vocalists is are are always late.
Every every time.
Right, so she gets a phone call.
She wanders off to the studio,erm, a room in a house, her mum and dad's house, to answer the phone.
Yeah, cos she she could say she's doing her hair, she did coming, I mean, she's doing her hair, or something like that, or is that terribly sexist?
But it is erm, erm, if anybody wants, one of the other band members could be doing their hair.
Yeah, well that's true.
Yeah.
Yeah, anyway, she she's told to get a move on.
She gets moving, gets there  she arrives fifteen minutes late.
It's time, they get to start recording, but they're missing the lyrics, so she can't sing.
That's because Ken forgot to photo photocopy the lyrics and they're at his house, with some other stuff and they discussed what happened on T V last night, but Ethel starts to get really annoyed, seeing as she was the one turning up late,and like, she was on about, we're paying a lot of money for this studio, let's use it.
Yeah, that's true.
But she turned up late to start off with.
Yeah, then they'll all have a go at her.
What do you mean, you turned up fifteen minutes late.
Yeah, then have a big argument, then.
Stand up 
fall ou fall out, not getting anything done at all.
Well, that's basically it, there.
So are they all gonna fall out, at the end, and not get anything done.
No, it's it's going to the end of the interview.
can't we have some violence 
See the thing is, Ethel, she's gonna, get romantically involved with Ken
with 
Oh no.
I think, I think that's not the necessary one.
It's not the drummer 
Bit of a twist in the story line, isn't it.
Big, yes, a big twist.
Okay, so they've just done their demo, but then are they gonna take demo to 
Yeah,organising the rock gala.
To you, to you.
Rock gala, to me, yeah.
Which is a bloody good thing, really that I started off with the tape,hands
Cos I was originally gonna let them do an audition for you, but I thought, na.
No, I think  tape, tape sounds like a good idea.
Erm, erm, they go to see, they, first of all it starts with them looking at a notice board with the notice on it.
Then they continue, they hand you the tape, you ask them a few questions, like what the band's called, how long you've been working together, and bla bla bla, and then erm, I think I I'm actually doing it with Kent and James and they're not thick.
No, oh, no, they're not 
But, they're not, I don't have them down as thick, but they 
No, no.
is
Yeah.
Mm, right, okay, that's alright then.
And then erm, erm, I've lost my thread now 
Yeah James and 
Kent
Yeah.
Yeah, right, and then erm, Kent or one of them is talking to you giving them your address,an no, giving them their address.
Yeah.
And so that you could send them the information about it all, and then James is just talking into the camera, saying, oh I'm really glad that this is happening, the band's gonna be really happy, finally we're on our way, bla bla,and then it ends.
Yeah, but I was thinking of 
Oh no, then it goes to the rehearsals, that's the bit of the script I haven't done.
Yeah.
It shows a few rehearsals as well.
That's quite good.
Yes, yeah.
I think you'd have a er er scene of, you know, Jonathan listening to the demo in his office and 
That's an idea actually, yeah.
Yeah.
So that's afterwards, yeah,
That's afterwards, yeah
So so wouldn't one normally, if they were that bad, refuse them.
No.
No, you can just look into the camera and say, erm,
Yeah.
Give 'em a chance.
That's not fair, that's not fair.
Mm.
No names mentioned.
No, it's not  so, so, how do I get everything out then, if nothing is 
Aw, it's like you said  only got two other bands.
it's exactly what you need, though 
They can go on first  sort of warm up band and that'll put everybody else in context.
Exactly, make everybody else look good.
Right, so the then we got the the gig.
Yeah, which John was doing.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's talking about, he's doing a rockumentary type thing with clips of the gig, that sort of thing.
Should be interesting.
Erm  in fact we, can we have a rock gala this term, perhaps we can fill them, fill them with imaginary er, gig.
And who, who are these characters gonna be, anyway.
I mean, what have we, what have we done so far, and then think about actually creating this group.
Well, I'll be the drummer.
I'm gonna be the drummer, and
Right.
I'll be the director.
okay 
We did say, that that if possible we shouldn't be, actually in it.
But for the sake, I think we have to make an exception, perhaps in Joe's case, because he actually is  a musician as well.
Was there any scenes with all all the characters in, because that, I mean, you're  isn't it.
Mm.
really, the other three people can be filming it.
Exactly.
I mean, it would make it easier from the point of rehearsing.
Yeah, I mean  
Yeah well I know but it's nice.
Mm.
Yeah, but if we're in it, who's gonna film it?
Exactly.
it it does need 
I could have drummed in  from outside.
Right, to play 
Well, I dunno he could be erm,
Bass guitar.
He could be either the bass guitar, or the
Cos he plays a bit of guitar,
Yeah.
so we really want him not to play, case, of being not familiar with 
Well, exactly.
That would be quite good.
Yeah.
And then we need a guitarist.
Well,could be the guitarist 
John would look good as the guitarist.
Mm?
John would look good as a guitarist, wouldn't he.
Yeah, he does play a little bit.
Yeah, that'll do, yeah, that'll be alright, then.
And then we need, erm,
Ethel.
Ethel Bethel.
Yeah,can be it.
Yeah, but George can sing.
No I can't.
Yeah, but not this sort of stuff.
So, how's that gonna work then, if if we need people to film and things, cos I'm not gonna film it for you.
Well, I I I've well 
Well, not in every scene is there, all the characters anyway.
sort of take turns in doing it.
Exactly, apart from, apart from the   play, the actual play.
What the actual 
And then we've got  and   
Do we have  
Exactly.
recording
ask the questions?
Like on our, on our scenes.
Yeah.
But I'll be sitting there asking 
Yeah, of course, yeah probably.
whatever questions I'm gonna ask.
interviewer  
eventually get to be 
So what did you do  
Yeah.
try and get somebody else to ask, then we fill their own you know, scenes, cos then we get what we want.
But is there, is there a situation where there's one, where where you're all in it?
All.
On only in like the the rehearsals and, like the actual gig and 
But even then, I mean, if he wants to be the interviewer.
can't just like, putting people off.
yeah, have to have the whole group there.
No, not really.
They've all got to be sat down, but
No well 
chair over there 
I was thinking, erm, in like
got to have the whole group there, otherwise it's 
one line in my, in my interviews, in my interview 
always said, but they don't necessarily.
No, no, no, in my interviews, erm, I done, erm, two two people, and they just, that way they can talk about each other without erm, having a fight or anything.
Yeah.
I mean, all th this script
Mind you, it's the,
one person and the interviewer, all of it.
Yeah,mi mind you, though, if Pete does it with everyone, then it's a change to what's been going on usually, it would be nice for a change.
Yeah.
If you see what I mean, to have that, sort of, contrast.
Yeah.
While everyone's there.
So I mean, I'm not gonna point the questions at anyone in particular, I'm just like have them answered,but I might just say to  is this normal for her to be late.
Now one of them will pipe up, yeah, she bloody always late.
Yeah, well, whereas in that, if they they when the recording the demo they have to be together, don't they.
Yeah.
Ethel's not there anyway.
Not for hers to boot,
So if if, but if you're interviewing, that only leaves 
Yeah, but you know, he can
Yeah
hold the cameras as well 
Yeah.
Sorry?
He can hold the camera as well.
What and interview 
But, wait, but the thing is yeah, there's only a few scenes where everyone's in it, right, and where people, everyone is in it, then obviously I'm gonna have help from you or from Andy aren't I?
Well,
I think we can do it.
I know you're not convinced,
No, I'm not convinced because 
You're not convinced, but I think we can do it.
The idea is not that you're actors on this course, but that you're learning how to film 
objection aside, I don't want to be in this at all.
Not interviewer, nothing.
Is that all of us.
So I mean, we could, we could recruit people in to do it, but the problem there is they've got to be free at the times when this course runs.
See, the thing is, everyone's gonna get the chance to be behind the camera or do some directing, because it's not.
Yeah, well if that's, if that's, I mean, that's all I am concerned about, that everybody does 
Yeah,
that directing,
Yeah.
everybody does a bit of camera work and sound and things and everybody experiences those different roles that you have so far covered, you know, across the documentary, but not in every act.
Mm.
Yeah well yeah everybody'll get the chance, because erm 
Definitely.
Yeah, but why .
So so we're saying, we perhaps need an interviewer,
Yeah.
and we need a  we need 
Yeah,discuss this really.
So, can we also think who this interviewer would be, wouldn't it be, sort of a really trendy sort of person, with, you know, I don't know  yellow hair, or, you know, sort of 
Oh, I don't know.
documentary.
two people, you know.
Yeah.
Where they're quite, sort of, trendy looking, aren't they.
I think they'd just be normal.
Just be  I think they'd just be normal.
It's alright I was thinking about  you've seen
But they aren't normal, are they, I mean, you look at N M E and you look at the language they use, I mean, that's not normal.
No, I wa I was, er er I I was thinking anyway, that it wasn't exactly like that, it's more like a Forty Minutes type thing.
Oh.
B B C.
Yeah, very over normal,
Mm.
extremely normal, because erm, I don't think N M E  interviewers would bother to do something like this.
So you want some something out of cutting a complete contrast between the sort of person who's being interviewed, sort of 
Yeah, I think that would probably 
Yeah.
work better.
And er, laid back, perhaps  
How how many actual scenes are there.
Erm, five, well five  
Five.
Acts.
Five acts, and the people that took  
Sections.
But have you got the 
scenes.
No, no, no.
But  
Have you got, have you got a 
First one.
First last.
Yeah.
Yeah.
First one.
Second erm 
Yeah.
So we can have like commercial breaks sticking adverts in between.
Oh, oh.
good idea.
Oh.
break coming up, you say, right  
like zang, have little cliff-hangers.
Break it up a bit.
Little cliff-hangers in between.
You can have your adverts in there.
It's a shame that they're all about a drink but anyway.
This is like some  getting done with the ads.
Yeah, but  
, and everyone else in the group.
Oh yeah.
Cos I've been trying to organise it.
So why don't we do this other one, your your static 
Yeah.
I'm actually, no I'm seriously considering doing it.
Right.
But I I really like to work with that lot, because the advert would be so funny.
Yeah, the exact, the set that  would wait forever, wouldn't it.
That's true.
So perhaps we ought to realise the fact that we've never actually gonna get that one down.
True.
Unless I could do, two.
Yeah, well perhaps, well we'll need one down there 
Oh yeah.
do the one that you can do.
Okay, well.
What what we need to do, is make sure these scripts are done before half term really, don't we.
When's half term?
Next week, I think.
Next week 
We really ought to be rehearsing this stuff, well finalising the scripts after half term.
Yeah, and adapting and the modifying 
I think what we need to do.
need to be rehearsing pretty much straight away.
Yeah.
Once we've got all the scripts done, I think we should erm, allocate roles to certain people behind the scene, so we know exactly what we're doing.
In each  in each section 
Yeah  do  
Who's doing what, yes, okay.
Right, okay.
So  is, I mean, you're nearly finished with your script,
Yeah.
is there a chance that you could work on this before Friday, and have a script.
I think so, yeah.
What about you ?
Definitely, I've got three quarters of it done, already.
Right, so, so hopefully we'll have a look at all the scripts, then, on Friday.
We've got time  though, don't we.
Yeah, but somebody else set 
You know, I mean, they'll be some changes.
It's not essential, is it.
No.
There'll be some changes.
There's a couple of people who haven't got the essay titles from  from last Friday, erm, have you got your copy of it handy , and that they could 
No,I didn't copy it down 
You didn't copy it down either, have you no intention of doing it, or something.
I did,at the back.
Well, I've got it written down here, and at the end of the lesson you can get it.
Is there anybody not want spare scrap paper.
Got loads, yeah, got tons at home, mum 
No, because we're doing something else now.
Okay, we don't want the entire lesson held up while you did what you were supposed to have done on Friday, right.
Now, we're working on language, now, but because a question turns up every year on paper one, to do with education, we're going to be considering education, and we're going to consider education in the broadest possible way, and that is, how do we know things.
Or more specifically, start considering how you learn things.
Now you should all have a spare scrap of paper that's blank on one side, out of my recycled paper box, okay.
At the top of this I want you to write, either a skill or an area of knowledge that you have, that you possess, okay, that you're pretty proud of.
That you know, that if anybody asks you to do this, or asks you a question connected with this, you can do it.
Right.
It could be, when you go to Quasar you win every time.
It,
I wouldn't bet on it.
it could be that you're the world's expert on Michael Jackson's greatest hits, I don't care, okay, it can be anything, if you were in the scouts, maybe you can light a fire with two matches.
I don't know, whatever.
Or half a can of paraffin, if you're anything like most of the scouts I've met.
But you see what I mean.
It could just be that you're the person in your family who knows what's on all those video tapes that nobody's labelled up.
Oh, that's me.
You're not, okay.
Whatever, I want you to think about, your skill, what you're an expert at, and write it at the top of the bit of paper.
Just one?
Well, one'll do, okay..
Where did you get it from.
haven't done anything.
Well, you're the leader.
Yeah, but I can't exactly write that down, can I?
Like like telling people I take after somebody important.
What are you good at.
I don't know.
I know, I can cut a loaf of bread on a machine.
Yeah, so can I.
I can work a till.
medium slice.
Medium or thick slice, par bake, yeah, we can do thick slice too.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
We know.
Oh, that's bad, that is.
I know.
I've experience of cooking sixty to seventy sausage rolls, every Saturday.
.
I can work a till.
fifty pounds, it's a real bugger.
spend any money.
spend fifty pounds worth of bread, do you?
No true.
I can work a till?
Oh, right.
Yeah, and I know what to do with cheques and credit cards.
I'm a professional pick-pocket.
I'm a professional stamp collector.
I don't know, I still can't write anything down.
spend money really well.
I can work a till and I know what to do with cheques and credit cards.
Yeah.
I think I'll put that as well  Mind you like everybody else  put that down, but
Well it's a skill I have.
I have, I did have experience with cheques and credit cards, but that was when I was working at the chemist, but now we don't take cheques.
Right.
Don't take cheques.
Where do you work?
I'm putting that to.
Have we all got something, sh, sh, sh, have we all got something.
Yeah.
Right, now, and here's the tricky bit.
I've looked over the shoulder at a few of these and they are obviously not the sort of thing, that you came sliding out of your mother's womb knowing how to do.
Okay.
Er, so some how or another you've learned them, right.
Right, could you manage to remember how you got that skill, or that knowledge, okay.
Er, you might also want to consider, er any gains that you have got from having this skill or knowledge.
Gains?
Gains.
Gains.
Gains.
does it just make you feel good, or, has it helped you to do something else that you wanted to do.
.
If somebody's written it about somebody else's biography, okay,it's auto if it's, you know.
Okay, now, what you should have in front of you, is a recipe for successful learning, because what you've got at the top, right, what you've got at the top is something that you've learnt, and you think you're pretty good at it, and what you've got in the middle is, how you got to be good at it, and what you've got at the end, is what you gain from having it.
Really, if we can make every single one your A levels follow that pattern, for you, we'd have excellent results at the end of the day, okay.
But, let's just see, if there is a pattern, or if everybody's different.
Okay, so what we'll do, is we'll combine.
First of all, perhaps if you could all let everybody else know what we're talking about, what your particular skill is.
Do we start over here with Martin.
And go round.
It's not exactly a skill, but, I've got good erm, at work I've got a good memory, like a knowledge of all the different items an the counter.
so yours is work related.
Yeah.
Good memory, for all the items on the counter, you have learned and classified a variety of material.
Cheeses and things like that, you know.
Cheeses, okay.
Right, okay, Jo?
Good at making quiche.
Quiche.
Good at making quiche.
Fine, er a number of skills involved there.
Right.
Oh, yes.
I mean, perhaps sometime after the lesson, you can tell me how you stop the pastry on the bottom going soggy.
Okay, Vicky.
Good at making scones.
Scones.
That's mine, yes.
That's the one I always use for this exercise is scones, great.
Lynn.
Playing the clarinet.
Playing the clarinet.
We've got a diversity here, haven't we.
What about the next table.
Knowing what's on T V every night.
Knowing what's on T V every night.
Knowing what's on television every night.
Okay, so the portable Radio Times.
Okay.
Star signs and that.
Yes, you're good on astrology, is it?
Astrology?
Yes.
Okay.
Really cool.
Darren?
Erm, eighties music.
Eighties music.
Right, well again, classification of a wide l lot of material well all three of those, yeah.
David?
I like sport .
Sport.
Yeah.
Any one in particular?
Boxing, football, athletics.
Boxing, football, athletics.
Okay, in boxing, have you got a particular move, a particular tactic, a particular punch, that they've
Yeah.
Which is.
No, just go mad, no.
It's all tactics.
So it's, you're good on the tactics.
Suppose so.
Okay, right.
Assa?
cricket.
Cricket?
Mm.
Yes.
Fine.
Knowledge of, or skill at playing or  
Skill and knowledge.
Skill and knowledge.
phworgh.
okay.
Hannah?
Erm, I can remember or orders and prices at work  that I have to do.
Again, it's memory and classification of material.
,
yes?
I can work a till and I know what to do with cheques and credit cards when people pay.
Right.
S so th th there's a variety of different skills involved in there, the the mechanical  the till and the  knowing what to do with cheques, credit cards, er, have you got a sense of when you've got to check up on a card, or something like that.
Yeah, I've caught two bad ones.
There you are you see, that is a very definite skill, which she, you're using an awful lot of that one, it would be interesting to know how you developed that that skill.
Stephen?
Ozzy Osborn 
Ozzy Osborn Again, material, classification, memory.
Red Dwarf.
Red Dwarf, again, the same, the material, the knowledge.
Erm, working on a till  knowing what to do at work.
Right, another work related one.
The same as well.
And the same with you.
Okay, isn't it interesting, isn't depressing, that absolutely none of these things was taught you at school, except possibly the sport?
No.
I mean, I knew what was going to happen when I started the exercise, but if you contemplate it from a teacher's point of view, if I go out and commit suicide or break down you'll know why, won't you.
None of you have said, my deep and abiding love of Shakespeare, my knowledge of relevant quotations in Hamlet, have you, er,
No.
You know.
Tony Morrison and American slavery, that's my area, that's  none of you, okay.
So,
let's think about what this means for education, let's er, work out how you learn , okay.
Now I might forget some of them but, er, what about er, you, seeing as how your skill is one that I haven't been able to acquire yet, Jo how did you get to make the perfect quiche.
Just trial and error.
Trial and error, I don't know, I think I've done enough of that.
Never mind , okay.
How many of the rest of you would say that you got where you are today, in your area of expertise, with trial and error.
David definitely.
My scone maker here.
Anybody else?
When you first started work, didn't you make any mistakes, Rowena?
Yeah.
But they're horrible about it so you don't do it again.
right.
Maybe I could learn how to be really horrible.
Okay, so trial and error and involved with trial and error is something that I'm almost certain that Assa and David are going to er,
come up with, and that's practice.
Yeah, a lot of practising.
Yeah.
Yeah, because you can't have trial and error without a lot of practice.
Erm, you too, Lynn.
Mm.
Yeah, there you go.
Trial and error, and   practice, lots and lots of practice, okay.
Anything else, er, er, Lynn did your clarinet teacher ever play the clarinet and let you see her playing it well.
No.
No.
Don't get taught like that, no.
You don't get taugh do it like that.
Did you ever see anybody else makes scones before you started.
Erm, my mum.
Erm, right, precisely the same way I learnt the same skill, watching somebody else do it right.
Did you ever watch people at work before you've gone into it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sport, erm, I remember when I learned badminton, that the teacher would show us the high smash shot down, until we saw it being done properly, if he told us the theory of it without showing us what it looked like when it was done properly, we wouldn't have known what we were aiming at.
Does this ring a bell in any of the rest of you, that learned a skill.
Yeah.
You saw it done properly, okay.
Now, there are lots of you, have got skills involving just memorising or learning of, doing research on a particular subject, whether, obviously, your Red Dwarf, how to you go about it.
Well I bought lots of videos and then watch them  a lot.
Aha.
Well, again, it's time, the commitment here   Okay.
Is it the same with you with Ozzy Osborn ?
Yeah.
And you spent a lot of time reading, a lot of time finding out.
Erm, do you get together with other people who share 
Sometimes.
Sometimes.
What about  and the Red Dwarf.
kind of.
Kind of.
Right, so also  this, the commitment  is shared, we'll talk about it, okay.
And I expect that same thing happens with the work related one, that because you're never at work on your own, or hardly ever at work on your own, and the same thing when you started, you weren't ever on your own, you could say to people, am I doing it right.
What's the best way to do this, okay.
So you're learning from other people as well.
Right, okay.
Now the question is why, well it's pretty obvious with some, it's pretty obvious why Rachel wants to know everything on television in her life, I suppose.
Planning a time  yeah? right?
Er, it's fairly obvious why you want to bake a quiche or a a flan, it's fairly obvious, is it, why you want to play the clarinet?
Why?
For pleasure 
For pleasure.
And the work one, there's a definite incentive of work.
Now  why are you doing A Level English?might want to talk that through.
biology.
And an answer has come up, with no, because they wouldn't let me do biology, you see.
You could tell each other about this, you don't have to tell me.
I'm pretty aware of it.
I was under the impression that we could choose our books.
.
Okay, have you had long enough to 
Eh?
So you've got an idea
Yeah.
about why erm,
The reasons will vary.
Some of you, I'm quite sure chose to do A Level English, because you were good at it at G C S E,
Mm.
and you thought you would carry on being good at it at A level.
What?
Erm, some of you chose to do it because you like reading, you like reading books, and you thought, it would be a chance to get an A Level doing something that you enjoy doing.
A lot of you are doing it because you want to go onto further or higher education, and you needed a third A Level to add to your other two.
Right.
Now, could we just consider this, because  you're all about seventeen which means that you'll be starting taking driving lessons some of you, quite shortly.
Have you ever met anybody who took driving lessons, without wanting to drive a car at the end of it.
Yeah.
Yes.
No.
Have you?
People have said, I'm taking driving lessons, but I never ever want to drive a car again in my life, afterwards.
Yeah.
It's just in case they ever needed to.
They  
Well, in case.
But they didn't say they didn't ever want to ever drive a car again.
They didn't want to drive, but they did, they learnt to drive, but they they said they never really wanted to do it, but only if they really really had to do it.
Had to.
A kind of a safety thing.
Yeah.
Most of you, when you take driving lessons, what end are you gonna have in view?
Bus driver.
Right, yeah.
yes, you are taking, going to take driving lessons in order that you can drive.
But you're taking English lessons so as you can go and get a degree in sociology or physiotherapy
doing A Levels, okay.
Er, it's it's  you don't have to be frightened of letting me know this, because, it it stands to reason, that it's going to happen, okay.
Now, so we haven't got the reason for you gaining this skill that you had in the case of making scones, playing the clarinet.
You learnt to play the clarinet, so she can play the clarinet.
So  orchestra.
You don't learn to play the clarinet so that you can erm, be a physiotherapist.
Okay?
and fair enough, but you can be doing A Level English because you want to be a physiotherapist, and you need that other A Level, is that not true?
Yeah, er, I mean, I'm not picking, I'm I'm, I mean Rachel's in my tutor group, so I know that there is another A Level subject that she's really very good at.
And er, gets more excited about than she does English, you see.
So erm,
This is, you know, this is how it happens.
When we're in the class full of people, and we don't have the incentive, that we don't want to do A Level English for it's own sake, but for another goal which is one further removed.
What can we do about learning it.
Do you think there are some of the skills that we got from here  Now there's one rather important, that I didn't put up.
It was involved with your trial and error and practice, but it was certainly involved with Vicky and that is  watching, or learning from  okay.
Now, can we get some of these into our English, the trial and error, yes.
If you avoid writing because you make mistakes, then when you are forced to write an exam, you'll still make the mistakes.
If you write a fair amount, and read your work critically and let other people criticise it, you will get better.
Think about people who learn really really important skills, how did they learn them?
Teachers learn in part, by sitting in classrooms, watching other teachers teach.
Did you know that?
Er, how do surgeons learn to do complicated operations.
Yeah, yeah, they learn their basic moves on corpses, so it doesn't do any harm.
Just as you learn  you learn your basic modes of essay writing in essays that I'm not going mark for A Level exams, okay, erm, but there is another way.
They have to attend enormous numbers of operations and watch experts doing it.
Alright.
Sorry.
So there you go.
How can we relate this to learning English.
Trial and error, yeah, do every bit of work that's set.
Practise writing even although you think you're rotten at it.
Yes.
It's sometimes not obvious what mistakes you've made in  English, it's pretty obvious to Vicky and myself when we make duff scones.
How can we tell?
Tastes horrible 
Yeah.
Erm, and you know when you've gone wrong in the clarinet.
Right.
Do you know when you've gone wrong in the clarinet, and you know when you've gone wrong with the till.
And, if you remember the layout of the cheese counter  you find out pretty quickly that the,
I didn't find out 
Sorry,
any of the counters.
Er, any of the counters.
Yeah?
Okay.
Well what happens if you go to the wrong place?
If they ask for some cheese, you won't get it on the meat counter will you?
Yeah, quite.
So you find out right away.
Okay, and this is difficult when you hand essays in, isn't it.
Very difficult.
Time commitment.
Do we have to talk about that word, really.
I mean, how much time do you put into the Red Dwarf?
More than you put into an A Level subject?
Full time.
Yeah, probably.
Yeah!and not only that, not only that, but Dan talks about it to other fans, right.
Now 
sharing it.
Well, we have talking English lessons, and we hope that you don't stray off the topic too much.
Sharing  okay.
How often do you talk about what you've done in English with somebody else?
Think about it.
I won't listen, honest, you can  just discuss that with yourselves.
Are you good at origami?
Origami?
Yeah.
You should have put that down.
I'm gonna, I can make you a paper star, if you'd like.
Yes go on.
Only if you make me an isosceles triangle, first.
Isosceles triangle.
I mean, no no, an equilateral triangle, please.
An equilateral triangle.
Okay?
Now.
Now, one of the ways that you will get better, is talking about it to people, okay.
Now, you may be a little embarrassed to discuss how you work with people other than in this classroom, although, as the course goes on, you'll find more and more people doing Hamlet in other classes, and you might find, especially when you're in the upper sixth, when someone in the lower sixth comes to you and says, what does this mean  that you can talk about it with them, okay.
Er, but, you can talk about other aspects of English  very, very easily with other people  and that is what you read in newspapers, okay.
I read this very interesting article on  corruption in government.
What was in it  somebody asks you.
Could you tell them?
Probably if you thought that, okay, I read this fascinating article about, what's his name Richard  th th you know one, the one who plays Spock.
Nimoy
Nimoy, that, Nimoy, right, I think 
I read this fascinating article about him, now you can see how interested I am in Star Trek, can't you.
Not at all.
Yes, but, Dan if Dan has read an extremely interesting article about this actor who plays in Star Trek, and he meets his friend who is also a Star Trek fan.
He'd tell him what was in the article, probably won't ya.
Mm, yeah, probably.
Probably, yeah, yes, you will.
Er, certainly I'm sure Rachel shares her information, even if it's only to say, you can't watch that because something else is on Channel Four at the same time.
Right?
Mm.
You share the information you got, but you talk about it, and you hear what other people have got to say.
Right, and you can do this with newspaper articles.
Erm, you are going to be practising at least one A Level skill when you do that, and that's precis.
Because when they say, what did the article say, and you tell them, you're summarising it, right?
So you can all do a summary, every single one of you, okay.
So keep practising that summary.
The other thing you can learn is style.
What is an appropriate style for an appropriate situation, because you all read outside English lessons, and you all know that, well, what about this one, what sort of style is that in.
Mm.
What would that be useful for, what's the audience?
Language 
college.
What do you think that style is.
How does it get its information across.
By writing 
A list, a very simple statement.
And you've worked out the audience.
What about this one.
Do the same for this one.
Yeah, it's good isn't it, yeah.
And then for these.
You recognise these styles, that's what you're supposed to do.
You recognise this style?
Well, alright, then, yeah.
And this one.
Now  have you all read examples of those styles, before?
Have you?
Have you read the, have you read articles or any pieces of writing that were like that before?
You read examples of styles like that before?
Yes.
Have you read examples in styles like that before?
Yeah.
That's an encyclopedia, yes.
And you've read bookmarks giving information.
Right.
You've all read these styles before, is that true?
You might not have read those actual pages before, but you can recognise the style, where it comes from.
You could recognise the style of a weather report, an Agony Aunt  all sorts of different types of writing, er, you could probably, if your reading is as wide as it ought to be, recognise the style of a leader from er, pretty heavy newspaper, Guardian, Independent, Observer, that sort of thing, could you?
Could you tell the difference between that and the leading article from the Sun?
Yeah.
Yeah, mhm, you could, you wouldn't get those two muddled up.
Er, you could tell the difference between er, newspaper on crime and the chief constable's report.
Right?
Or, er, an article in the Times about crime prevention, or problems with youth, you could tell the difference, couldn't you.
You don't seem so sure about that, could you?
Yes, of course you could, and not just because there's pretty coloured pictures in one and not in the other  although that's part of it, that's part of the presentation.
Now, if I asked you, right, to present information about this A Level, cos it's something you all know about, okay.
In the form of  a very brief list of what we want to know about A Level, could you do it?
Could you make a book mark out of it.
Ju just  no,
a book mark of the information you need to know about English A Levels.
Probably, yeah.
Could you write an article for somebody in the top year of your last school, about English A Level, and what they should be able to, what they should expect?
Yes
Yes, definitely.
Yeah, you could do that.
Would they look the same?
Don't know.
Don't know.
Could you write an encyclopedia entry on  Beloved?
No.
No?
No.
Depends how well you know the book.
Sorry?
Depends how well you know the book.
Well, you ought to know it well enough to write five or six lines about it, which is all you need for a book.
Right  and you would know what style to use, wouldn't you, or would you?
Oh, no.
What's the difference between the encyclopedia style and the other styles, then.
Can you work that out.
It just comes straight to the point 
Yes, it's concise, so is the book mark, it's informative, it comes straight, but, it  it's very factual, isn't it.
It doesn't say, some people think A Levels are a good thing and some people think A Levels are a bad thing, it wouldn't say something like that, it wouldn't be vague like that, it would say, A Levels are the qualification issued in most sixth forms in England and Wales, right, erm  they generally need a two year course of study.
They are recognised by all British Universities.
It'd say something like that, wouldn't it.
Mm.
The facts about A Levels.
Right.
Next stage up from G C S E, the stage before er, a degree.
You're happy about that.
Now, we're going to work on summary skills this week, and you have summary skills already.
If I said to you I missed Neighbours on Friday, what happened, a lot of you could tell me, couldn't you?
Right.
Yeah, I, yes, but a lot of people could tell me, right.
Er, and if I said it about any television programme you had watched.
If I sa said to you, tell me, could you describe to me briefly the layout of where is it you work?
Safeway.
Safeway.
You could do it, couldn't you.
Easily.
Easily, yeah.
Right, if I say  could you summarise the plot of Revenge of Khan could you do it?
Who.
Shows you how stupid I am about, now which is the Revenge of Khan then?
Star Trek.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, I bet, sorry?
There you are, you see.
There you are  and again you get the problem, you see, that I'm just not interested, so I don't learn these things.
Erm, and it's probably the problem that a lot of you have with Hamlet, you see.
Okay, Red Dwarf, oh dear, character study of  whatever the Liverpudlian's called  I've forgotten  yes.
You can do that, yeah, of course you could.
Right.
Could I just have your attention, it's just the end, for practice, for summary, you need to be very aware of why certain pieces of writing are written the way they are.
Mm.
Which audience demands which style, okay, we're going to be practising that over the next week, and the other skills to do with summary.
for the benefit of those who've forgotten.
You were going to look at ways of classifying the short stories you've been looking at, when y , sort of, to look at similarities between short stories, like which ones deal with husband and wife relationships, which ones are about loneliness, I mean, use your paper, it's it's only there for scrap paper, you haven't got to produce something that's gonna be pinned up on the wall.
Erm, and there is some more paper over on the the easel over there, if you want another sheet.
But just use it first to brain-storm some ideas about, you know, what sort of things are the stories about, what ideas, what themes are they dealing with, and which stories deal with those themes.
Alright, and I'll talk about, well, the lesson finishes at twelve, so if you have about a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes on that, then what I want  each group to have someone who will report back on what the group's been talking about in the next twenty minutes or so.
Alright.
Any questions on that?
That's fine,things that you haven't thought of, that's coming from what they've done, okay?
So erm, spokesperson for this group.
Shall I hold it up for you, and erm, or somebody'll hold it up for you.
If you'd like to turn round, turn round and address the attentive multitude.
You might not be able to see all of this  somebody will talk you through it.
Go for it.
Right, we sub-divided the whole book into four main areas, we divided into, husband and wife, male and female, loneliness and death.
Most of the stories  into categories,one or two.
For a husband and wife list we've got , the Black Madonna,the Stone Trees, and the Weekend.
And for male and female, we've got all of the ones above and , Summer Picnic, The Different Nights, A Love Match, Miss  Love Letters, The Man .
For loneliness we've got Miss  Love Letters, Annie, No Survivor  Stone Trees, Mannequin,The Visitor,The Picnic, Summer Picnic, Different Nights, Love Match, and New People.
For death, we've got Passages of  The Different Nights, No Survivor and The Visitor.
Yes, any questions.
Any comments.
It's better than ours.
Better than yours.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well that's a good lead into yours, then.
Would you like to talk about yours, thank you.
this was Isabel's idea of 
Shut up!
No.
Erm.
Isabel's going to work  paper.
Do you want again, talk about this one, first, or gonna 
No, no, no.
as you can see.
Well, what we were going to sort of do, is similar to what you lot did, but it kinda came out wrong.
Yeah.
In the sense that, we wanted to categorise them, under things like, sex, race, religion whatever, and  colour code.
we're gonna be thinking about it beforehand, so, we can scrap that.
Right,decided to do away with that, because what's happening here, is what I don't want you to do really, cos we've been, we've been through the stories, separately,
Yeah.
Right, so I I actually don't want it, don't want you to do that again, we've looked at each story to see what it's about, so it's actually better to take the idea and erm, get get the stories and to write the idea.
Now actually, they do themselves down, because this is where they started, you see, can you talk about this one?
Erm, we started off with   was that, erm, we would just write down any word that came up to our head, in terms of relating it to the story  i.e. we thought about memories, and  memories  Erm, this is gonna match up with your  isn't it.
Yeah.
tell us what some of the ideas of, could you just quickly go through  the areas that you identified.
The areas?
Well people might like to write them down, if they haven't thought of them.
Well, sex seem to 
quite large  
sex written three times up there.
Erm, we've got sex and memories, women versus loneliness,, erm race, class, relationships, religion  erm 
couples, motherhood, incest, marriage, sadness, relations, grief   that's what we think covers quite a few of the stories, don't we.
Yes, well, they haven't got round to it.
Let's, what you, Oh
Classified.
under those headings,
Yeah.
Okay.
We did try.
Yeah, we did try, I think that's quite pretty.
Okay.
Having failed, just try again, you know, the spider syndrome.
Right.
Have I got so many sheets of paper then, I need about six hundred people to erm,
Yeah, we went through these stories, and tried to link all different things they go under, got attitudes, weight, sex, exploitation, memories, mother and child relationships, old fashioned settings, aspirations, working women, ageism, husband and wife, loneliness, change, working in middle upper classes, racism and grief, and then, we started again, through the stories giving numbers, and putting them under the headings we thought they came under, but the thing is, we've got a lot of them under all, well not all the headings, but a couple of the headings.
A couple of the themes.
Yeah, we haven't got rea like they've done, you know, just four.
Mm.
But we're probably beginning to make ours smaller now.
Mm.
Yeah, erm, I mean, I think, what you've, what you've actually done is identified quite a lot more areas than they, they had four, which which they did in in some detail, and they got the stories  classified, erm, what you've actually thought of, is is far more areas, which I think's good, erm, and maybe other areas to consider as well.
Erm, what would be more useful if you could identify the stories, that are to to do with memories.
A  count-down.
They aren't chapters though, are they.
Erm,
It's Miss  Letters is the best one, erm, The New People, Summer Picnic.
How did you get  to work though, did you just like.
We had to  
We all did it as part of an English lesson.
But 
Erm, what else have we got  The Man Who Kept  Bus Station, and The Lone Survivor  memories.
Alright.
What have we got then as a mother, mother and child.
July Ghost erm, Summer Picnic.
You know, sandwiches or whatever she just have, like, but it was kind of 
She did have a mother.
Oh shit.
And then to, right, let's start doing that one.
Yes.
Fall from grace.
This erm, old fashioned whatever it was, is is quite an interesting area I thought, erm, whether, it sounded old fashioned to start with, an old fashioned what.
Whether it was attitudes or setting or  relevance to modern life, you know, to what extent are some of the stories  relevant to their time and place, and not to our time and place, so that might be an interesting area to explore.
Erm, and to look at the stories which are of a different time  but are still relevant to our time and place, they have a, have a message for us, even though they were set a hundred years ago, they've still got something to say us, so I think that's an area we need to to explore.
I certainly think that this is good in terms of, it gives you a a lot of areas, even if they don't necessarily identify the stories, so, if you're, sort of taking notes about which areas.
Yeah,
that's the abbreviation obviously, but if you're looking at the areas, I mean there is, er,
I think you've identified a lot, obviously the husband and wife relationship, and obviously the men women which is, one you looked at.
Change, is an im er, as an important one, how, how different writers present change.
So, if you've got, sort of, three or four stories that you know, that you could deal with, the type of question you might get is, discuss how erm, different writers deal with the subject of change, with reference to probably about three stories.
Er, loneliness, I mean, a lot, so many of them deal with loneliness, you'd think that was a preoccupation of women short story writers, I think.
I can't see what's here, working oh, class, the class thing comes out.
Grief.
I suppose grief, loneliness, loss  they're all interconnected, aren't they, so any one of those could come into it.
Morals, attitudes, again, there's a bit of a cross over there.
Sex, exploitation.
I think between you, I should think you've covered quite a lot of erm, of the areas there.
I mean, some and some of the issues are, perhaps not the main issue of the story, but er, are sort of peripheral, if I can use that word, on the, on the edge, like  identified weight as a problem, which a lot of middle aged women seem to encounter and get obsessed by it, but actually, the weight thing there, but the central thing is the relationship between the husband and wife, and the weight issue is sort of, I don't know, tied up with it, but it it wasn't the main issue.
Right, so that's a brief gallop the the various issues in the short stories, does anyone want to er, speak now, or for a long time, hold your peace.
Does anyone want to say anything  on the subject.
Not gonna say anything for the microphone.
Okay, then, erm, can I collect the pens up then, and erm, Wednesday, you're all going to write your assigned essay don't forget.
Julie?
Have you got time to  somebody.
Essay on Wednesday?
Right, the apostrophe.
Are you ready?
The apostrophe.
Right, the examiners at A Level  expect, an A Level student to be able to use the apostrophe reliably and correctly, so let's just erm, go back to basics, with the apostrophe, as it seems to cause more confusion than, practically anything else.
When an apostrophe comes just before an s at the end of a word, it shows that something belongs to that word.
So you write the car's windscreen, The Sue's bike, and the King's head, it's it's an owner, plus possession, and the owner has the apostrophe of the thing that comes immediately afterwards.
Alright?
So if a word, the word, the cars, occur at the end of a sentence as in erm, I went to the showroom and saw the cars  full stop.
There would be absolutely no u need to use an apostrophe because there's no possession to follow it, it's always got to be in that pattern of owner and possession, and if it's one, then it's before the s and if it's more than one, it's after the s.
So that covers the next point about plurals.
You don't add another s obviously, cats' cradles, rabbits' feets, divers' suits, are examples.
The exception, because there's always an exception to every rule.
If the plural word doesn't end in an s, you use the apostrophe and then you add an s, and these, I think, are the only, there are three, er, is men, women and children, because the singular form is man, changes to men, so is apostrophe s, the women the same, the children the same.
So that's the only place, I think, where you're going to find, where the word is a plural, the apostrophe comes before the s, is where the plural didn't end in an s.
Write the apostrophe and then the s  and that's the only reason for putting an apostrophe before an s, or after an s at the, at the end of a word.
Now that's not every word, this is what happens when you start doing the apostrophe, that, there'll then be a spate of whenever you see a word ending in s, ah, word ending in s, use an apostrophe, regardless of whether you should use one or not, now you are a lovely  think about it.
If it's not in the owner possession pattern, then you don't use an apostrophe.
There are lots of words that end in s, and you don't need to use an apostrophe on them unless it's an owner.
Which, as a straightforward plural, is a straightforward plural and the cardinal sin is putting an apostrophe on a word which is a verb, which shows really you're not thinking about it.
You know, she sits by the window.
Well, what logic is gonna put an apostrophe on sits.
It's it's a verb.
You're only ever going to get an apostrophe on a noun.
You can't possibly have it on a verb, and that's another little rule you might like to think of, that you're only going to get the apostrophe on a noun, and you will never get an apostrophe on a pronoun.
So that why it's possessive.
Never has an apostrophe, it's only on a noun that you're going to do it, so, you could pick up sort of, just little, clues there as to , how to remember what you're doing.
Right, a little exercise for you.
Exercise one, put in apostrophes where they are needed in these sentences.
Okay,sentences.
Think about it, though, don't just blindly put them on any word that ends in s, make sure you know why you're putting it there.
Okay.
One minute  We're welcome to collaborate with the person next to you, you don't have to do it in splendid isolation.
How are you doing, have you finished 
No.
No.
the first group of four.
No 
The sheep's intestines are causing people a lot of difficulty.
in number one, what have you erm put the apostrophe on.
Erm, on athletes.
Where?
Between the e and the s at the end.
Correct.
And in between the t and the s on assistants.
And that's the verdict of you all, is it?
No.
No.
Should be an apostrophe over umpires as well.
There should be an apostrophe on umpires as well.
So there should be one on assistants too.
Yes.
Yeah.
Because it's the umpire's assistant,
and it's the assistant's chair.
and the assistant's chair.
So it's the umpire's,
assistant's chair.
So I should think both of them were apostrophe before the  so you got
Three.
How many of you got the three right in that one?
Is that all?
Right, erm, Martin, number two.
Erm, well I just put one on friends, between the d and the s.
You put one between the d and the s of friends.
Yeah.
Father's  
It's father's as well.
Certainly I think fathers, as in my father's friend, yeah, and my father's friend's aunts, yes, so one, r and s of father's, in between the d and the s of friend's.
And councils.
And councils.
And you'd like one on, yes.
Where would you put in on councils.
Between l and s.
Between the l and the s.
Tell me, has anyone got an apostrophe on aunts?
No.
No.
Shoot yourself.
I have.
Shoot yourself.
Between the t and the s.
On aunts?
Come on  get your brain going,
After the s.
what what's the possession that comes after aunts.
After the s.
?
There ain't one aunt, is there?
No, there ain't one aunt.
There ain't one
I know there ain't.
Right.
Okay, so it's on father's friend's, and council's and on nothing else in that sentence.
I'm not doing well.
Erm, Ella.
Number three.
Erm, I put the apostrophes between n and s in stations.
Yeah, between the n and the s of stations.
Mm, I put one after s in laboratorys.
You put one af after the s of laboratorys?
Mm.
No.
Between the y and the s.
Because if it was laboratories, it would be I E S. 
I E S, yes.
If laboratories is plural, it would be I E S and you would have the apostrophe after the s then, but it's obviously singular, cos it ends in y so you put it after the y and the s.
And erm, Charlie!
The sausage skins 
Oh yeah.
I put one between 
Pardon?
I haven't done that one.
You haven't done that one.
No.
Well, would you like to have a go?
No.
Put one between p and s on sheeps.
You'd like one between the p and the s of sheeps, yes, I would agree with you there.
Erm  erm, the n and the s on skins.
No.
No.
No.
Skin's what?
No.
Skin's what, what's the word that follows it Charlie?
Are,
Skins are  
It's not  you can't have it on skins.
Mallards, then.
Yes, we'll have one on mallards, between the d and the s.
Don't have to, though.
Pardon.
It looks like, it could be a name, because Mallards could be the name of a company.
like.
Well 
No, it's not.
I mean, if the company was Mallard, then  
In a Mallard , but Mallards, you don't know, though, you start 
At the end.
I think you should like, forget that one for a while, because that  
But you can't  Mr Mallards, can you?
Well, I did, I don't know,I've crossed mine out, so I wasn't  you see,
Oh, right.
and you can see the crossing out there.
We should have an enquiry, whether it's Mallard 
I don't think we need to type an enquiry, I think that the people who realise that, the fact that you had got there  is meant to indicate to you that name of the firm was Mallard, and therefore by using by using Mallards, sausage skins, they're expecting you to use apostrophe s.
Yeah.
Erm, and so that's all you need,
Between the d and the s of Mallards, and the p and the s of sheeps.
Did anyone put, did anyone put apostrophe after the s of sheeps.
No.
Cos it's one of these words where the plural doesn't end in an s.
Sh.
Right, put your hands up  if you got all of those right 
Okay.
I would have got them all right except for 
Fine, right.
Now try the next s set of four then, and erm, see if you can er, improve your score.
I like the  second one, next one.
That's right .
It's they, if it's the same  
Would you, would you like to do a group collaboration on this one, because erm, can you come up with a version that your group agrees on?
Yeah, that's true, Wendy 

Erm,
It's Culture Beat and Cherry Lips, which is our out-tro music
Erm,
but unfortunately, something's wrong with the equipment, or something 
Oh, I see 
so it jumped to this different track, with different timing, and it came up, I like you, so I thought, oh, let it roll.
Is that an early Christmas present, that sweater?
Do you know how old this sweater is?
No
What do you think, what do you think?
Pam Dixon's here, the bearded wonder has taken himself off for the weekend 
Yes, er  
I thought you were calling me the bearded wonder then.
Dominic's changed dramatically,
I know, I know
Dominic you do look strange since
Yes, I know
And this is
The nicest looking edition of Dominic I've ever seen
A much better Dominic, you've improved dramatically 
Thank you very much 
Yes
This is, you're not gonna believe this  
no go on tell, tell me
Right, like it, it is about fourteen years old
Is it really?
It looks, it looks as good as 
Is it nice?
Yes Christmas red you see 
And still, still still fits you, you haven't put a weig you haven't put any weight on at all.
Anyway
It's running up the stairs that does it.
Pam's rather impatient to get on
Is she?
Oh why?
Yes, she absolutely is so, we'll have to erm, find out from you what they've been talking about.
Well, we had our Friday debate
Mhm.
and the Friday debate was, Christmas has lost its meaning because of commercialization, it was er the old chestnut, you know.
Well, ninety percent, nine O percent agreed.
Erm
Ten percent disagreed, and I was not surprised.
it starts a lot earlier, doesn't it, ever earlier.
It does, end of November, we've got another two weeks to go, oh it's, Christmas should be Christmas shouldn't it?
You know, one of the effects are a little bit tranquil but anyway, the other thing which erm, everyone really enjoyed, er, cos I know you would remember this er, Dougie, is your first kiss 
Oh, I don't think I can, it's so long ago.
Oh come on Douglas, come on
No, no it's so long ago, no, no, no, no.
Can I ask you, when was your first kiss, Pam?
It was erm, I shouldn't think, I shouldn't say this on the air, it was f on a cellar steps, at a teenage party.
Disgraceful, that!
I had to go and look at somebody's chandelier, that was hanging in the cellar
Really
erm
Oh dear, Dougie's getting a bit, I see Dougie's getting a bit er, yeah, erm 
A bit hot under the collar.
Anyway, one lady said,
Go on,
one lady said she was put off for life after her first kiss, and never kissed another man.
She's now in her seventies.
Yes, it's the effect you have on women 
Someone had a kiss in a broom cupboard.
I don't know what that was like 
a broom cupboard 
lovely,
a kiss after Postman's Knock,
yes.
and one lady was told by someone who kissed her first, first kiss, said to her, she was just a natural
Right
I thought , so I'll leave it at that 
as the song says, a kiss on the hand is quite, continental, diamonds are a girl's best friend.
Right, and on that happy note, we'll start with the news, Dave thank you very much indeed.
Well er there's some happy news.
Three British hostages are on their way home from Iraq, after being freed from a jail in Baghdad.
The release of Paul , Michael  and Simon  follows a mercy mission by former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath.
Iraq is denying that the move is a bid to have sanctions lifted.
Well it's one of the talking points this morning, if you'd like to give me a call.
Has a deal been struck do you think, what's in it for Saddam, what's in it for Britain?
I'll be talking to our diplomatic correspondent, David Spannier, later in the programme.
In fact, after the seven o'clock news, but if you'd like to get ahead with er one of your comments, then it's .
Labour has broken off parliamentary relations with the government, the move which will end the system of pairing for Commons' votes, is in protest of plans to rush controversial legislation through the Commons.
And, health and safety watchdogs say they're not convinced the Channel Tunnel has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers.
The tunnel is due to open next May, but the Health and Safety Executive say procedures still haven't been tested.
On that talking point perhaps, would you go through the Channel Tunnel, knowing what you know about it at the moment?
Anyway, Pam Dixon has sat very, very patiently through all this claptrap with laddie, now here's the sport.
and Michael and Stefan Edberg meet in the semi-finals of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich.
The winner is set to be some half a million pounds better off.
And you might be better off if you put a tipple on the old racing today.
It's at Doncaster and Cheltenham.
Well, Derek  had another winner, he's had a very good week Pam, by his standards.
He's had three winners in four days, and he had  at Fakenham yesterday, at fifteen to eight, so not too bad a day for  again yesterday.
Fingers crossed.
Right, see you in the six o'clock news er spot.
Okay.
Okay, right, time to check on the first travel report of the morning.
Rob  morning   Twenty one minutes to six the time, if you'd like to give me an early ring, then it's .
Well, quite a few talking points this morning.
First of all, the main story in our news at five thirty, and I think unless anything more dramatic happens, it will be the main story right through the news bulletins of this programme.
Three British hostages on their way home from Iraq after being freed from jail in Baghdad, Paul , Michael  and Simon .
They're released, and all this follows a mercy mission by Sir Edward Heath.
Well, I wonder if you feel that er, there's something more to this than meets the eye.
Saddam has never been known for doing something for the benefit of others.
It's obviously for the benefit of Saddam, and I wonder what you think that benefit might be?
Do you think some deal has been struck?
Saddam certainly has done his best to milk the whole occasion.
I think it was er fairly evident that he had given permission for the three British hostages to be released after Sir Edward Heath's meeting with Tariq .
But er no, Sir Edward had to go through the full rigmarole of a meeting with the great man, I put that in inverted commas, but er I suppose he thinks he is, the great man himself, Saddam Hussein.
So, I wonder if you feel there is a deal.
I wonder if you feel that even if there was a deal, the British government, the Foreign Office, represented as they were, so admirably really, by Sir Edward Heath, he seems to have done a very good job, I wonder if he had to work very hard, or do you think perhaps, anybody could carry that out?
Sir Edward, of course, has had experience in getting hostages freed before.
So er, perhaps he was the man for the job.
There's a lot to discuss here, and er I just wonder if you'd like to throw in your two penn'orth before I talk to our diplomatic correspondent, David Spannier on this subject, after the seven o'clock news.
is the number to ring.
Now, another story that is er an interesting one this morning, and I'd like to hear your view on, families with two television sets could soon be paying twenty pounds extra for their licence, to lessen the burden on hard-up viewers.
Well, a lot of people might think that is very fair, the new charge would mainly hit households where the children are allowed their own sets.
But of course, a lot of er family homes now have er more than one set, perhaps more than two.
There's generally one in the main parents' bedroom, perhaps there's one in one in er one of the youngsters' bedrooms, there could even be one in the kitchen these days.
So er, I just wonder if you feel it is fair that er you should pay twenty pounds extra for another set.
I wonder if you should pay twenty pounds more again if you have a third set and again if you have a fourth set.
Give me your views on this.
Other changes, this is the Commons' Heritage Committee of MPs who er were sitting yesterday, under their er leader Gerald Kaufman, the former Labour politician, well he still is a Labour politician, but er he's not so high profile now in politics, but he seems to be creating a bit of a stir here.
Other changes include high, higher charges for hotels, a new fee for car radios, and an increase in specialist programmes, funded by subscription.
But I think the twenty pounds extra for another telly is the one that er you might like to comment on this morning.
. Health and safety watchdogs say they're not convinced the Channel Tunnel has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers, and after that incident a few weeks ago, which was er certainly played down by the authorities, I wonder just how safe the Tunnel is.
Well, it doesn't open till May, but the Health and Safety Executive say that safety procedures still haven't been tested, and even if they had, would you go through the Tunnel?
I was at a dinner other night, er where er French Railways were the hosts, and of course they were doing their best to er tell everybody to travel through the Tunnel naturally enough, because that's what their trains will be doing come May, and er one or two people, it must be said, were just a touch sceptical.
I wonder, if you'd been at that dinner, would you have joined them in their scepticism.
. Now, at around twenty five minutes to seven, I'll be talking about a fascinating report in She magazine, and it's entitled How to Survive House Guests from Hell, and it's a seasonal item, and of course we all know that er we, a lot of people er go to stay with friends and relatives over the Christmas period.
Frequently they stay for some days.
And it will be some days this time, because Christmas day is on Saturday, so it's a very long, long weekend and holiday period.
So if you have house guests for the festive period it could be that they might be staying four or five days.
I wonder if you're looking forward to it, perhaps many of you are?
I wonder how many of you are dreading it, it's the duty visits, it's the duty receiving isn't it really?
There's a Danish proverb, you know, that states that fish and guests smell after three days and er we all know the visits which have begun so successfully from friends and relatives, it needn't be Christmas, it could be at any time of the year, which are often ruined by people lingering on well past their sell-by date.
So, we'll be looking at er, some of the categories of people who come to stay.
And we'll be looking, more importantly, at how you can perhaps get rid of them when you want, or even better, er put them off altogether.
That's er a little bit of fun in that, but er we might have a little bit of advice for you if you are preparing to receive guests you'd rather not see over Christmas.
If er you've had dreadful experiences with er guests staying at your place, give me a ring on  and share your horrid experiences with me.
And of course the tragic death, far too early really, for Danny Blanchflower cut down by disease, and er one of the greatest footballers, I suppose, not only of his generation, but of anyone's generation and er, how sad it is, that we should lose two of our greatest footballers in this one year.
Both the old style wing-halves, I suppose they'd call them mid-field players now, Bobby Moore and now Danny Blanchflower.
Danny graced the Spurs team of course, er completed the double with them, when he was captain, and I know a lot of Spurs supporters will remember those days.
Perhaps you'd like to reminisce and say was he one of the greatest players ever to put on a Spurs jersey.
I suspect he was, or come to that a Northern Ireland jersey.
It's fourteen minutes to six.
A quick reminder, many people will know, but a quick reminder and er, if you've perhaps just come back from holiday yourself, or you're one of our new listeners, you may not know so I'll tell you, Douglas Cameron's Breakfast Call, this very programme, will be breaking new ground at the end of next month.
We'll be travelling down under to Australia, and coming live to you for a whole week from Sydney.
And, this is the exciting bit as far as you're concerned.
You could be travelling with me.
We're looking for two couples to make the trip with the programme.
It'll be a working holiday, but my goodness it'll be the experience of a lifetime and to find out how you can join us stay tuned for the Dougie Down Under competition thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Eleven minutes to six is the time, and if you'd like to give me a ring on any of the subjects I've mentioned, then it's .
People are joining us all the time, so I'm very briefly er just in a word or two, going to go over the subjects, and then if you want to give me a ring, please do so.
. The main story of the morning as far as our news bulletins are concerned.
The three British hostages, released from jail in Baghdad, now on their way home from Iraq.
Sir Edward Heath has done an admirable job, do you think that the die was cast anyway?
That er any er public figure worth his salt could have achieved what Sir Edward has done, or do you think he's brought something special to the negotiations, and why has Saddam done it?
Not for the benefit of others, he never does anything for the benefit of others, one can only feel that he sees some advantage in releasing these British people.
What is it?
Has a deal been struck? and if a deal has been struck, what do you feel it might be? and do you really mind, as long as these people have been released?
And let's not forget there are one or two more in there as well.
They may not be British, but er there are more hostages in there, because hostages really are what they are.
Twenty pounds more for any extra television set that you may have in your house.
Do you feel that's fair?
Another twenty quid if you have a second television set on your licence, I wonder?
And, how to survive house guests over Christmas.
If you've had a horrifying experience with some visitors that you've invited, then let me know.
. Nine minutes to six, the time.
Frances has joined me from Harrow.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I would just going to talk about the television licences.
Please do
Erm, well if we have to pay twenty pounds extra for erm, an extra television, what about the shops that sell them?
Mhm.
Will they have to pay twenty pounds for each television that they have?
Because I assume they pay er, just for one licence now?
Do you feel it's a good idea?
No, I don't.
I mean, some people erm, are elderly and they're confined to their homes, they may have one downstairs, and one in their bedrooms.
Mhm
I mean, I only have one er, I would like two, but my husband doesn't want another one, but 
Is, is that because you can't afford it?
Oh no, well erm, I assume we could afford it, he just doesn't like one in the bedroom so we have one downstairs.
Fair enough.
Mhm.
But other people erm, I, I think it's a lot of money.
It's enough that you have to pay for the licence, which is erm, what is it eighty pounds 
Er over eighty quid isn't it?
Yes, that's right
Eighty three pounds I think.
Well, it's erm, every other station on, on erm, has erm, advertising, why can't the B B C now have advertising?
Ah, well now that's a different erm barrel of worms isn't it really?
Well, if that's going to help them with the money, then they won't charge for extra televisions.
Right, so you reckon that er they shouldn't charge twenty quid more for another television set, they should take some advertising?
That's right
What on B B C One?
On all of them, why not I mean, erm, on B B C One and B B C Two.
Every other station has, you even have advertising on radio, why can't you have it now on B B C One and Two and cut down the eighty pounds ?
Well yes you don't have advertising on B B C radio of course do you?
I mean the B B C er television and radio is er still what we call er, state controlled, isn't it really?
Not, not a commercial sector at all.
Yes, but if erm, they want to put their licences, er they're the only ones that have the revenue from the television anyway,
Mm.
why can't they now decrease that, and er start doing advertising?
Okay Frances, well, er, we'll get some comment on that after the six o'clock news, I'll be bound.
Never mind paying twenty pounds extra for a second television set, and another twenty pounds if you have a third set in your house.
Why don't the B B C, both radio and television, take advertising, and then we not only would not need to pay an extra twenty quid, we probably wouldn't need to pay the eighty odd pounds that we're paying already for a colour television licence.
And now throw something else in.
How about a special purchase tax on televisions, what do you feel about that?
Ring me, and we'll take your calls after the six o'clock news.
The number, as ever,.
It's six and a half minutes to six.
Judy Flowers here to have a look at our stars.
Good morning.
Good morning, Doug
Well, it's a bit of a sandwich this weekend, isn't it really?
It is .
We t we sometimes talk about sandwich days don't we, sort of you know the morning, the evening and the middle of the day?
Yes, we do, we do.
Well, this is very much a sandwich three days, because we've got today and Sunday looking quite good, but a rather difficult and tense Saturday sort of tucked in between.
B er, both today and Sunday look very good for socializing and generally enjoying life, but on Saturday I think it's going to be very important to keep things in perspective.
Why is that, why has Saturday got in there?
Among the bad ones?
Well, we've got, er, we've got a difficult aspect, a rather tense aspect.
It's got nice flowing aspects today and Sunday, and these rather tense ones coming up on Saturday, so that's why it is.
Mm.
And, this is particularly so, this er keeping things in perspective, for you Sagittarians tomorrow.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Monday's not gonna be wonderful for me, I've got to go into hospital for a little operation er b but seriously, I'll be out on Tuesday, but I'll, I'll be away for the week er, because the Doc said don't come back to, to work till a week on Monday, so I'll, I'll try and listen if I can, but what have you got for us?
The aspects on Monday are very good, Douglas, so don't worry.
Are they?
Good, good.
Yes, there's a new moon and a lovely aspect between Mars and Saturn, which is all about disciplined and constructive action.
Have a very good weekend everyone, Douglas, have a, like I said, a good week, get well soon, come back and see us soon.
I'll be back with Jeff Clark on Monday.
Yes, indeed, Jeff here on Monday.
I'll be back, er, hopefully a week on Monday.
Hope so anyway.
Right, erm, the travel before the six o'clock news.
Thought we'd play a little er different version this morning, just to er change things round a bit, but the message is the same.
At the end of January, Douglas Cameron's Breakfast Call will be broadcasting live from Sydney, and in the next few minutes, I'll be telling you how you can win the chance to travel with me, all expenses paid.
Stay tuned for the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Nine minutes past six, and it's the morning of Friday, December the tenth, if you've just joined us, as many people do after the six o'clock news, or even before the six o'clock news, welcome along to the programme.
Now some of the main talking points this morning, certainly the big story as far as the bulletin is concerned this morning, or one of them anyway, one of the top two.
The three British hostages, who are on their way home from Iraq, after being freed from jail in Baghdad.
The release of Paul , Michael , and Simon , follows a mercy mission by Sir Edward Heath.
Iraq is denying the move in a bid to have the sanctions lifted, but er I just wonder.
Er, we heard yesterday from some of your phone calls, and indeed we heard, and some of us may have seen on the television news on Wednesday evening, the desperate plight that many Iraqi civilians are now in.
The sanctions really are beginning to bite and I wonder if Saddam feels that er he may be able to ask a favour or two from the West, in return for the release of these three British men.
He never does things er for the good of er the people concerned.
It's generally for the good of himself, and I wonder what's at the back of his mind with the release of Paul , Michael  and Simon .
Do you feel some deal has been struck with the British government?
If it has, do you worry about what deal it is, as long as these three men are released, or do you say we shouldn't do deals with people like Saddam?
Did it send a feeling of revulsion down you er when you saw Sir Edward Heath shaking hands with Saddam Hussein yesterday?
Or did you feel, well, he's done an admirable job.
Do you feel that anybody could have done that job?
Or did it have to be somebody like Sir Edward?
A lot of things to answer, and er I'd like your replies please on  on that particular story.
Now, already we've had calls on the next story.
Families with two television sets.
How do you fancy paying twenty pounds extra for the second set?
Well I know you don't fancy it, but do you think it's fair?
Well, this has been suggested by MPs on the Commons' Heritage Committee, and this is part of their proposals to spread the burden of the B B C's one point six billion pound costs.
It would, they say, lessen the burden on hard-up viewers who can't afford the eighty odd pounds, I think it's eighty three pounds isn't it for a television li a colour television licence now?
Anyway let's call it that, it's around that.
Eighty three pounds.
It would er reduce the burden on those who can't pay.
So I wonder what you feel?
And I wonder if you feel that er if you have three television sets, then you should pay twenty pounds for the second and another twenty pounds for the third.
Now, er some people are ringing up this morning saying well why, why the devil should we pay.
Why if the B B C want to make more money, first of all, can't they get after the licence dodgers?
Well, I think they are making great inroads now into catching a lot of people who er simply refuse to pay er their television licence, but of course there are a lot more who er are still escaping the net.
But er, if they got a few more of those it might help.
But the main thrust of your argument this morning, is that the B B C, both television and radio, should take advertising.
Well, I wonder if you feel that's a good idea.
I know people who will say it's not a good idea, and that's the people in commercial television and commercial radio, who, if the B B C started to take advertising, would see their slice of the cake get just a touch less.
So, er we here may not think that the B B C should take advertising, but er let's hear your views on .
The Channel Tunnel in the news again this morning.
Health and safety watchdogs say they're not convinced that it has sufficient safety measures in place to protect passengers.
The Tunnel is due to open next May, not very long really you know, but the Health and Safety Executive, say safety procedures still haven't been tested.
Well, we had that incident didn't we, several weeks ago in the tunnel, which the authorities er tried their best to play down?
I wonder, bearing in mind that incident, however serious, or minor it was, would you be one of the first to go through the Channel Tunnel?
Er, would you be perhaps, er, willing to see how it went, and then maybe go through it next summer or next winter, or would you never, ever go through it ever?
. At twenty five to seven, just after the six thirty news sequence, we're gonna be talking about a report in the latest issue of She magazine.
Everyone, I think, is vulnerable to the guest, or guests that descend upon you from time to time.
Generally relatives from Scotland in my case, and decide to stay, having invited themselves, and you can't really turn them away, er, decide to stay for two or three days.
Well, some of them you greet with more affection than others, it must be said.
And er, a lot of people of course, will be looking forward, or perhaps dreading Christmas, and the guests that are coming to stay at their house.
If er, you've got guests coming, are you looking forward to it, or are you not, and er I'd love to hear some horror stories of er past Christmases, when you've had er perhaps unwelcome guests, or guests who've overstayed their welcome.
Well, we may have a few helpful hints.
I'll be talking er, to the writer of the article in She magazine in about twenty minutes' time, and er we'll discuss with her, how you make the best of these unwelcome guests.
They fall into some categories don't they, like the lazy slob, who never does anything, never washes a dish or ne never helps at all around the house, so even though they stay there for about a week.
So, er, I'm sure we all know them, how to stop them coming, or get rid of them as soon as possible.
That's what we'll be attempting to find out in twenty minutes' time.
And Spurs fans especially, but football fans in general, I'd like to hear your tribute please, to Danny Blanchflower who died so tragically at the age of sixty seven yesterday, from Alzheimer's Disease.
I suppose er, he must be in the top ten of all-time great British footballers, wouldn't you say?
One of the greatest players ever to put on a Spurs' jersey I would think.
A man who led Spurs to the League and Cup double, some thirty or so years ago.
You must have some memories of Danny Blanchflower, playing for Spurs and Northern Ireland, if you'd like to share them with me, it's .
It's sixteen minutes past six.
Seventeen minutes past six is the time, and we still have some trouble on the travel front because we've got delays on the Northern Line of the underground.
When I say we've got some trouble, we do, but it's not like the trouble we had half an hour ago, when in fact there were three lines, sections of which there were no trains on at all.
But, er, that's been resolved fortunately, we've still got some delays on the Northern Line, and er, obviously do allow yourself a little extra time if you're a Northern Line traveller.
If you're one of that unhappy breed.
Maybe I'm doing them a dis-service, but I don't think so.
Right the cancellations on British Rail.
Right, we'll take some calls after this, starting with Humphrey from Kew, David from Pinner and Bob from Edgeware.
And that by now familiar music to many of you means that in five minutes it will be the Dougie Down Under competition thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
As many of you will know, we are going at the end of January, with the programme, to Australia, to be broadcasting live from Sydney for a whole week to mark Australia Day.
And we're looking for two couples, er it needn't be husband and wife particularly, although it'll be er very nice if it is, but it can be mother and daughter, father and son, any combination you like really.
Two couples to come to Australia with us, and to act as roving reporters, travelling round the country, reporting on what they see to me, on the telephone, live on the programme, all expenses paid, thought I'd just er let you know that er very important fact.
And of course, the fact that you are going to be roving reporters will mean that you will have to, if you become a finalist, be able to do an audition live on air.
You must of course, have a valid passport, and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January.
So, in five minutes, I'll be asking you the fifth and final question, which could result in you're going out next month with Dougie Down Under, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Twenty and a half minutes past six is the time.
Humphrey has rung me from Kew.
Good morning.
Good morning Douglas.
Erm, I want to talk to you about erm, em,hosp hospitality over Christmas.
Right.
Erm, to, to, as, as, this,part of it, part of each other,Th Th Thursday, one horrific er erm, guest that my mother had in, in our house down in Gloucestershire, erm, she has a lot of clients, er erm, she's an artist, erm, erm, this woman, erm, er,w er, went up to her bedroom, and erm, and was standing b b by the electric fire and  fire, and erm, very nearly scorched her nightdress.
In er incredible, and erm, she asked to come away, and erm, erm, she, my mother was, was up, up half the night with it.
What
Oh, That's all you need isn't it, really?
Yes.
Yes, absolutely, set the house on fire
Oh, my goodness me, Humphrey that's a horrifying experience.
Yes, yes.
And I wonder if anybody can match that, I don't mean match that, when she nearly set off her nightdress on fire 
Quite  but I  no 
it's a Freudian slip isn't it really?
But, er what a horrifying experience.
Of course, these things can happen really, er especially if er, one of two of the guests, I'm not suggesting your mother's guests er over-imbibed, but one or two of the guests do have a few jars over Christmas and they get up to all sorts of things in the house don't they?
Douglas, I've got two very, very, very, quick, quick, quick very funny stories,
Yes
erm,f from the erm, erm, former Bishop of Gloucester, erm, what is erm, and what is your erm,def definition of hospitality?
What is my definition of hospitality?
I don't know Humphrey, what is your definition of hospitality?
Making people feel at home when you really wish they were.
And another one,
Yes?
erm, what is your definition of happiness?
Definition of happiness, what is it?
Eating with nice people,drinking with nice people, and sleeping with a clear conscience.
Humphrey, thank you for that.
Twenty two minutes past six is the time.
David has rung me from Pinner.
David good morning.
Er, good morning Douglas.
I'd like to well, number one I'm an Arsenal fan, but I'd like to speak up on er on the tragic loss yesterday.
Of Danny Blanchflower?
Because to me Danny Blanchflower, we lost England's number one, now we've lost Ireland's number one, and it looks like we could even lose John , before long, of a similar type of er illness.
Yes, I, I was actually just saying to my wife last night, erm, who would have ever thought that in the same year, we could have lost two of the greatest wing-halves, as they were in those days, but I suppose mid-field players they'd be known as today, who'd 
Yes.
have ever thought in the same year, we'd have lost two of the greatest players that this country has ever seen.
Yes, but er, the other thing, Douglas, the sad thing about it was, Danny Blanchflower was great er, on and off the field, and it was the old heavy ball, and the longer you played with it, the heavier it got, and then you had that lace in the centre, difficult to er, head a ball, then you had the studs, well, as you know yourself, it's nails.
Half of them were badly worn, everybody was open to erm, serious leg injuries
Yes.
and erm, that finished er, er, Derek er, er  of Sheffield Wednesday.
Derek 
Derek , sorry.
Derek .
That's right, yes.
But er, finally about er, our great er Tottenham er player.
I don't think the guy was ever booked.
No, I shouldn't think he probably was, David, thank you very much indeed.
Anyhow, I hope all goes well for you next week.
Don't worry, it's not too bad Douglas.
Bye.
Oh, you've had one have you?
Yes, they're referring to the fact I'm just going for a, it's a hernia operation actually, so er everybody says, oh you, no problem at all.
Hope they're all right.
Bob from Edgeware.
Good morning Bob.
Good morning.
I haven't recovered from Humphrey yet.
Erm,
He's a card, isn't he?
erm, right, Julie erm .
I'm glad her husband and all the others are coming home.
Yes.
But I'm very annoyed with er, the incessant canting about the John Major government.
Does she really think that Edward Heath would have got the connivance of the Foreign Office or the government, without it being sorted out beforehand?
All it needed was for the envelope to be stuck down.
You, you don't think then, that Sir Edward Heath did anything special to get the release of these men?
Not really, and to use your words, was there anything about any revulsion of watching them shake hands with Sa that animal, Saddam Hussein.
Well, I wonder.
You see, see.
I, I, I, I just wonder how many people would say oh, that's awful.
I never thought I'd see the day when a British politician shook hands with Saddam Hussein.
W w what was your own particular feeling Bob, on that?
Well, I don't, I'll be fair.
I don't like Edward Heath at any time, so I'm slightly prejudiced.
He went there, he shook hands, he'd shake hands with a vulture if he thought he could get him up the pedestal, but that's neither here, something was done.
A deal was done.
I don't think there was a promise, you will get.
The promise was probably vague, we'll see it, we may use our good offices to the United Nations to some sort of embargoes or, that's all ca they're likely to be promised because we're not in a position to promise anything.
Okay Bob, well Bob thinks that a deal was perhaps done.
We'll be talking about this to our diplomatic correspondent, David Spannier after the seven o'clock news.
It's now six twenty six.
Right time for the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Two couples must win an all expenses paid trip to Australia with me, when the Breakfast Call comes live from Sydney at the end of January.
We've had four questions already this week, if you missed any of them, we will be repeating them next week, but now here is the final question.
What is a baby kangaroo called?
What's a baby kangaroo called?
Now, as soon as you have the five answers, and do remember that if you er, didn't hear any of the other ones, they will be repeated next week, so you'll have a chance to write all the five answers down.
I want you to send them in to me, and here's where er it becomes a little bit different from other competitions, I want you to send them in to me on a Christmas card please.
We want to get really festive about this, so answers on a Christmas card only please, to the following address.
. Answers, the five of them, on a Christmas card, to  and your cards to be in please, by first post, next Friday, the seventeenth.
Six twenty seven.
Right, after the six thirty news sequence which is coming up directly, we'll be talking about a fascinating report in the January edition of She magazine, about house guests who may well be coming to you for Christmas, and who may well outstay their welcome.
We've all had them, haven't we?
in the January edition of She magazine, but although it's the January edition, it er does pertain to Christmas, because it's all about the guests you invite to your home over the festive period, some of whom you could well do without.
Well Christmas coming on apace, it's twenty two minutes to seven by the way, and it's coming far too fast for er many people I know.
It's er gonna be with us a fortnight tomorrow isn't it really, and I wonder if you've got people coming to stay over the festive season, and I wonder if you're looking forward to it?
Undoubtedly, some of you will be, but there must be one or two people who are actually dreading Christmas er bearing in mind that they've had to ask somebody whom they don't really want in their house, or perhaps that person or people have asked themselves, and it's very difficult to know how to refuse isn't it really?
Especially when they come from a long way, away.
Well, how to deal with such guests, and er what sort of categories do they fall into.
There's a fascinating article in the January edition of She magazine, it was written by Madeline Rice and she's on the line to me now.
Madeline a very good morning to you.
Good morning to you.
Right the problem is of course, that a lot of these visits start off quite well, but they wear a bit thin after the er third or fourth day, don't they?
Yes, there's a er favourite proverb of mine, a Danish proverb, that says er fish and guests smell after three days, and I think
I think that's probably quite true.
I think after three days they've er worn out their welcome.
They, they've seen all the sights, and they've eaten the best of the food and er, erm, it's time to go really, before you know they get, they outstay their welcome, and go past their sell-by date.
Nice way of putting it .
Some people never quite know when to go, don't they?
Oh, some people just, you know, I've a, a friend who's erm, who was with someone at college and he er, said he was gonna stay for a week, and you know, months later, he was still there.
I mean, so that guest, that is absolute peril.
Yes,an and one never likes, er, the minute they're in the door, to say, when are you actually going?
It sounds so discourteous 
but of course, er three or four days later, you're very sorry you didn't pose that question the minute they er put their foot on er 
Yes 
your hall carpet.
Erm, there must several categories.
In fact, I know there are, because I've had a look at your most amusing, and relevant article.
There are certain categories that these guests fall into, aren't there?
Yes, erm, the, the most archetypal one is, is the miser of course, who, who turns up with a stale box of chocolates and an ingratiating smile, and proceeds to eat you out of house and home, and then when you're at the supermarket, disappears mysteriously at the checkout, and returns when you've paid with a, a bumper bag a crisps that he keeps in his bedroom when, in case he gets peckish at night.
You know, he may take you for a meal after he's stayed a, a fortnight, and it'll, he might lose his wallet, or, take you to the sausage and chips place round the corner, so he, he's a nightmare.
And then there's the, the over-amorous couple who er,
it's always nice to know your friends are in love, but erm,
Yes.
it's a little bit disconcerting when they forget you're there, and erm
Especially if you've got thin walls.
Yes, so you have to, if, you know, with your weekends, where you know there's a lot of banging of spoons, animated chat, to, to cover up what is so audibly going on upstairs.
I can well remember, I can well remember when our children, when our children were quite young, and er we had such a couple staying with us.
And er, without putting too fine a point on it, er there, there were quite a few moans coming from the bedroom, from the lady, and er, my son said, er, er, I don't think she's very well daddy.
I think she's, she's ill, don't you think you should go in and see what's happening, I said, no, I, I don't think so, I think, I think her husband will take care of that.
Anyway, the over-amorous couple, yes, they're a bit of an embarrassment, aren't they?
Anybody else?
Well erm, children, people with children who don't know how to behave, or, or at least use your house as a sort of running ground, erm, not living in London, er, er, I have lots of guests that come from London, sort of using it as, as much as one would exercise dogs, and, and let their children r run,like round the house, and then er, I'm sort of saying things like, oh you're, you're very, very sensible not to have decorated until after your son's older.
You know, so that, that's a bit of a nightmare and they erm, sort of never tell their children off, so you know, you're s some ghastly little child can be floating your CDs in the bath
Yes.
or scrawling on your tiles
We're all laughing, but, I mean, it, it, it's absolutely er, enraging, isn't it?
If it happens to you, yeah.
Oh, absolutely 
And the c couple that, that never, never stop arguing.
They, they probably come in a foul mood, and er, they, they keep up that er bickering over the whole of their stay.
That's right, they've probably had a row half way there or something, and it just carries on, you know.
Yes.
And then they try and enlist your support.
They get you in individually, and sort of reveal embarrassing personal stories, and there's, I mean it just becomes a battleground, your house for, for the weekend.
Madeline, is there anything that can be done?
I think you have to sort of, lay your ground rules, I mean state your case, quite early on and it, I mean, you know, if, if you're not good first thing in the morning, you know, you could tell someone you need three cups of coffee before you're safe to approach or if erm, there's a lazy slob who sort of lies on the sofa all day, you could throw the dishcloth at him, or  erm, and also, I mean if it, if there are sort of badly behaved pets and, and children, erm, you know, just, just don't invite them, and if that means your guest list is, is somewhat shorter then all to the good.
I mean you could always go away on holiday, if you'd like.
I mean that's, at this time of year, when  it's coming to the time when people coming round with bargain barrels of biscuits
It is difficult, isn't it, not only at Christmas, and, and we suffer from this, probably you do as well, friends from London.
Er, we originally, my wife and I, come from Scotland, and when you get people ringing up from er Scotland saying, well we're just passing through en route to Paris, or Amsterdam, or somewhere, can we stay with you for a couple of days, it's very difficult not to say, er, well, I'm busy isn't it really, and you, you've got to accept them really?
Yes.
You have to, because, how can you be busy for that entire period of time?
It's too hard to think on, you know, on the hop, you know, it's not a, it's impossible.
They have to, they have to come.
Yes, yeah.
Well, Madeline, thank you very much indeed.
There's a lot in this er, article.
Thanks 
It's very amusing, and you've explained it amusingly to us, but er, there's a lot of truth, I think in er, what you say and er how can we, er make the best of these unwelcome guests who insist on turning up at the most inopportune times, when we're trying to enjoy ourselves.
Anyway, I'm sure you'll have horror stories, of guests who've invited themselves.
Guests whom you've had to invite, although you really dread it.
Er, perhaps, er, something like that is gonna happen to you in a fortnight's time, this Christmas.
I'm sure that over the years, you'll have er, gone through some of the experiences that Madeline and I have been talking about over the last five minutes.
I'd love to hear your horror stories please, with guests in your home.
Not necessarily at Christmas, any time really.
is the number.
Five, no it's not, quarter to seven is the time.
And, er after the break, it'll be Anne from Hither Green, getting us off on our section of phone calls.
Most people, I think know by now, certainly regular listeners will know, that at the end of next month, the end of January, this programme, Douglas Cameron's Breakfast Call, will be coming to you live, from Sydney, Australia, to mark Australia Day.
And we're looking for two couples, four people, two couples, to travel with us, and to find out er, how you will be able to travel, and what you have to do when you get there, stay tuned for the Dougie Down Under Competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
I can tell you it's all expenses paid, it's a fabulous trip, and er, we'll tell you how perhaps, you can be on that plane to Sydney with us, later in the programme.
Anne from Hither Green.
Good morning Anne.
Good morning Douglas, nice to speak to you again.
Thank you.
Erm, you brought back memories you know, when you were talking about unwanted Christmas guests.
Yes.
When we were children, about two days before Christmas, my mother used to face us all defiantly, and say your Aunty May's coming for Christmas, and we all used to scream no, no, not Aunty May please.
Yes, she has nowhere to go, she was like a damp sponge.
Yes.
She used to enter the house, squelching misery behind her
Oh dear!
face us all, and the whole Christmas used to be, we used to tease my brother cos he was the young one, you know, and she'd say, no, no, don't tease the little , oh, no don't say that, and the whole of Christmas, was Aunty May sitting on a sofa, being fed brown ale in never ending glasses, not adding one single thing to the whole of Christmas at all.
was not a word she knew.
Did she come and stay with your family every Christmas?
Yes, and every week she'd appear just like the weather.
Oh, she was, she was fairly local was she?
Yes, and in the end it taught me tolerance and love, because I really learned to love her.
I loved her, even though she was miserable, because she was kind,
Yes.
underneath that exterior, and it made me realize, that you know, you don't have to like your relatives, I'm afraid, you have to put up with them, and love them.
That's right, you can pick your friends, but you can never pick your relatives unfortunately.
Anne, what a lovely story, although it wasn't very lovely, was it, when Aunty May came round for Christmas, and inflicted herself upon the whole family, with her own particular brand of misery?
But, er, I wonder how many Aunty Mays there are coming to your house this Christmas?
Peggy of Surbiton, good morning.
Morning, Douglas.
I've got a very funny story.
Erm, a few, a very few years ago, I met a, a daughter of a friend on, on a bus, er going into London.
I hadn't seen this, this, I call a child, which she was,excuse me, for about erm, twenty five years.
Anyhow, she's living on her own in London, she's not married, so my husband said, oh ask her over, perhaps she'd like to come for Christmas.
So we go up and pick her up in Kensington, bring her back, she unpacks her bag and plonks herself down, she eats everything that's put in front of her, and second helpings,
you can laugh, she never lifted a fork or a plate off the table.
No.
We waited on her hand and foot
Yes
and do you know, she had the most enormous Christmas er lunch, about six o'clock she said, could I have a bowl of soup?
Oh no.
Yes, and Boxing night, she came up with the, er, the same e enormous breakfast, enormous lunch, do you think I might have two lightly boiled eggs wi with er soldiers?
Oh, lovely
Yes, forty five years of age.
We packed her off the, the following day.
How did you manage it?
Well, my husband just, just, just said that we were going out, we got to go out, and we couldn't, that was it.
Oh.
So he took her back, to make certain she kn she was there
Yes.
but, er, it never st we waited on hand, she never even made her bed 
Yes, well this is, this is one of the er, categories that we've been talking about.
I think she would fall into the lazy slob category, Peggy?
I called her a slut.
Well yes, er
Bit, bit, bit more vicious, because, I think it's dreadful.
We waited on her
Some people are like that, Peggy, some people are like that.
They expect to be waited on hand and foot, they've got no consideration for others.
Oh, yes, there's a lot of them about you know.
Terry from Camberwell, good morning Terry.
Morning, Douglas.
Er, you know, Ken, Kenneth Clarke is absolutely right to er protest about the hundred billion for a job creation scheme in Europe.
He knows that most of that money will come from just three member states, Britain, France and Germany.
All the others will get a handout from any funds set up for whatever reason, Douglas.
Mhm.
Each British tax payer at the moment, is paying about eight pounds a week for the E E C, and most of those tacp tax payers were dragged by the hair, screaming into Europe, erm, I don't think there's any doubt about that.
This government is actually cutting back on everything here just so that the French farmers and the mafia can live in the manner to which they've become accustomed, Douglas.
Terry, thank you very much indeed.
Er, we're getting quite a few calls on that subject now, John from Erith, good morning to you John.
Morning, Douglas, I think that's totally unjustified, myself, yes, I, I think 
You do?
Aha, right what is your view of things?
Well, erm, we were worrying about erm, the government being weak in representation in Europe over the two pin plugs,
Yes we were,
well you can guarantee they're gonna fight tooth and nail over this job creation scheme, to stop it.
Mhm.
Why do they do it, Douglas?
When it's really important, biggest evil in this country, is the unemployment.
About five million, million unemployed, when you take the true figures into account.
Well, do you think it's as high as that?
I do, yeah, personally, yeah, well, you know it's a lot higher than it actually is with the erm, anomalies 
Yes, yes.
that are em, accidentally cut off the erm, figures,
Yes.
by this government, but er, this is so important to them, it's gonna actually cost them some money, this government, er, they don't invest in anything that's important, it's the biggest drain on us erm, budget deficit.
Or it's the biggest cause of the budget deficit erm, in this country, is unemployment and social security etcetera, and we get a, a brilliant plan for erm, job creation, and what do they do?
Black it.
Well, indeed, that is what they're gonna do.
John, thank you very much indeed, two contrasting views there.
And indeed, at the summit today in Brussels, John Major is going to fight plans by the European Commission for a one hundred billion pound job creation programme across the Community.
As I say, contrasting views on that story, and er if you'd like to give me a ring with your view, then it's very, very welcome.
We'll take calls on that and indeed any other subject in the news after the seven o'clock news.
It's now six minutes to seven.
The time now, on the Breakfast Call, with me Douglas Cameron, is three minutes to seven.
Let's move on to the birthdays and the anniversaries.
We'll do today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
Those are the birthdays and anniversaries.
If you'd a dedication mentioned on the day, and it's er, very important isn't it really?
If you er, send one in, to get it mentioned on the day, well we certainly do our best, er, sometimes, er, the er, anniversaries and the birthdays, not very often, are crowded out by er, any news stories that we may have to bring you, became first and foremost this is a news programme, er reflecting the stories of the day, but generally speaking we manage to get a full list of your dedications in.
Can you let us have a birthday or an anniversary message in writing please, a week before the actual date, don't forget to tell us who it's for, who it's from, and the date.
Commonsense you may think, but it's amazing how many people leave out one or more of those essential details.
So we'll do our best to get your dedication in on the day, if you will do the rest.
The seven o'clock news coming now, right here.
Well, that by now familiar music will tell you that at the end of January, Douglas Cameron's Breakfast Call will be broadcasting live from Sydney, and in the next few minutes, I'll be telling you how you can join us down under, for the Dougie Down Under Competition, stay tuned for that, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
The time now is nine and a half minutes past seven.
I want to concentrate, er for the next five minutes or so, on one of the main stories of the morning.
As you may have heard in the seven o'clock news, three British hostages are now on their way home from Iraq, after being freed from jail in Baghdad.
The release of Paul , Michael , and Simon , follows the mercy mission by former prime minister, Sir Edward Heath.
On the line to me now, is our diplomatic correspondent, David Spannier.
David, a very good morning to you.
Good morning, Douglas.
Why at this point in time, has Saddam Hussein decided to release these three men?
Let's say first of all that Ted has done jolly well in getting them out, and everyone deserves er, er you know, he deserves a tremendous vote of thanks from everyone.
But Saddam's motives are not at all altruistic, as er, everyone, everyone can guess.
It's simply that he wants to create a better atmosphere, and show that after all he's a reasonable man, and we shouldn't be too hard on him in these days.
And he gets a lot of publicity out of this by er, being photographed with Ted Heath, by announcing that he's showing clemency to people who are convicted by the Iraqi courts, and that really people shouldn't hold too much against him.
Well, he's certainly made a lot of it, didn't he?
Milked the occasion for all it was worth.
I would have thought, that after Sir Edward's meeting, or Ted, I kno I don't like to call him Ted, I know you know him intimately, David, so you can call him Ted, I'll call him Sir Edward, but after Sir Edward's meeting with Tariq Aziz, surely that was enough, wasn't it?
But Saddam had to just play the whole game, and er, he must have got a lot of propaganda out of this, mustn't he?
The, the old handshake, with er, Sir Edward?
Well, he does, and he doesn't, Douglas.
I mean, if we take this as a game, as you rightly describe it, he only takes these people from th in the first place, to have hostages that he can use as bargaining chips later.
I mean, these three men, may or may not have strayed across the border, but they certainly did nothing wrong,
Erm
and they're just jailed for long periods of time, because he wants to assert, Saddam wants to assert, er his authority and show how erm, tough he is.
But really these people, and there're about thirty other nationalities, by the way, being held, he just wants to show how tough he is, and it's useful in the future, as now, when he wants to make a gesture.
The publicity is fairly short-lived, of course it has tremendous effect on the British media, and we're all very, very happy for the families of these people
Yes.
but it doesn't actually change British policy, or alter the fact that sanctions are going to be maintained against Saddam.
But for his part, er, it looks good, er he gets lots of promotion in the erm, Iraqi press, which he controls anyway, and Iraqi television, and he comes across as a kind of, er, father of the people, who can on one hand show great severity with executions and so forth, on the other hand, dispense er justice and human feelings, and show that he really loves people in general .
But David, he's not proving a very good father is he, because er, I'm sure many, many people will have seen pictures on television on Wednesday night, of how these sanctions are really hurting the Iraqi people.
The ordinary people in the street.
Yes, and that is Saddam's dilemma, I mean,yo the point about him is this, one mustn't think of him as being a rational er politician who does sensible things, for sensible reasons.
That is the wrong way to look at Saddam.
He's a very, very emotional, unstable dictator, who's just been determined somehow to exploit his position geographically, in the Middle East, to try and emerge as a sort of mini superpower, and to that end, he's done a lot of terrible things, of which the invasion of Kuwait was really only one.
But in the course of that, he's so angered the international community that sanctions as we know, economic sanctions have been levelled against Iraq, and they have bit, and they have hurt the Iraqi people, but in general, Saddam is not responsive to that kind of pressure.
After all, even if his people as a whole are suffering privations and losses, and can't buy all the things they want, it doesn't affect him and his ruling clique.
He has the perfectly healthy, happy life.
Have you seen pictures of him?
Yes.
See how sleek he looks, and how dark and well  and such,yes, he does, he does 
He looks very healthy, doesn't he, very, very fit?
Erm 
er, but there is a point at which, you know, he's always trying to evade sanctions, and usually, and it's a genuine case, he asks that er, essential supplies, like medicines and such, should be allowed through, and er, in the general, the United Nations have responded by saying, Okay, we'll give you that, but you've still got to observe the rules of the international law, which I'm afraid, again and again, he flouts.
So, there's no real sign on his part, of a change of heart.
No, I mean, there's nothing to stop him arresting more British people, or er, any nationality, come to that, and saying well, they did stray into our territory, I'm sorry about this, but er, we can't have that sort of thing, you'll have to er, come and see if I want to release them in a few months.
Nothing to stop him er, doing the whole all over again, is there?
Well, he's doing it now, as I say, there're about thirty other nationalities held in Iraqi prisons.
But this isn't the worst of Saddam, I mean, this is er, a human tragedy for all the families involved and it concerns individual lives, and for that we're always very upset.
But er, he does much, much worse things to his own people, and in particular, the people in the south, called the Marsh Arabs, or, or the Shea Arabs.
He's continually er, persecuting them, and there's many, many indications that he uses er, poisoned gas, or chemical weapons, and er lays waste their whole villages, and he's seeking to do this because he wants to dominate his own country, and not allow any minorities a chance to look after themselves, and the same applies of course to the Kurds in the north, whom we have a direct responsibility, the international community, to protect.
Now this action against whole groups of people is so awful Douglas
Erm
that I fear, that sooner or later, we'll probably have to go to war with Saddam again
You, you, do you really feel that?
I do feel it.
I'll tell you why.
I mean, there are many, many cases of injustice around the world and, the West, the British government, can't be responsible for all of them, but there's, there's one particular case of Iraq, where we've already gone to war, to, in the cause of democracy and freedom, and I don't believe that when Saddam offends again as he does day by day, we can turn a blind eye.
We can turn a blind eye to some of it, but the point is always reached when he goes too far, and intervention is required, usually only in the form of American attacks by aircraft on his offences in the em, areas where he's not supposed to penetrate.
Yes, would it be a possibility, perhaps, that Sir Edward Heath, might try to get the other European hostages out?
His success rate with er, British hostages is outstanding isn't it?
Well Ted is a very, er, experienced operator.
He's always had his heart in, in diplomacy and he's got the kind of authority you need for this.
That is, he's an ex-prime minister, who can face er, Saddam across the table, you know, on equal terms.
At the same time he has no political authority, er, representing as it were the British government, he's just an individual of stature, and he's got the time and the energy to do it.
I don't think that he could look after other countries, although the same sort of precedent could no doubt apply for example, the former French prime minister, there's probably quite a few of them around, could be found to go to 
Yes 
Iraq, and do the same kind of negotiation.
The danger is that er, Saddam exploits this er, more and more, and seeks to try and get sanctions overturned.
Well, that won't happen.
But I think that from, er, Sir Edward's point of view, he has done jolly well, and er, the families have already expressed their great gratitude to him.
Well if I may, er, coin one of your phrases, well done Ted.
Thank you David, very much indeed.
David Spannier, our diplomatic correspondent, giving us an expert's eye view of the whys and wherefores of the release of the three British hostages, who happily will be home very, very shortly.
Seventeen minutes past seven.
I thought for a minute, he said down to Mr Blobby didn't you?
Well, he keeps calling me Mr Robbie, because, for some reason, he thinks I resemble this silly character.
Yes  I can't understand why.
You are, you are, perhaps you are, you, you're a little, two or three pounds over your fighting weight for a man of your height, but still,
I know, I should be eight foot six, but, I'm working on it
We had enough of Blobby yesterday, without any mention of him on the programme again.
Right, it's twenty minutes past seven.
We can't afford modern technology now, we've got one of these old wind-up gramophones.
Right, nevertheless, not withstanding, etcetera.
In five minutes, it'll be the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
I'm sure most people know by know, that er this show will be coming to you live from Sydney, Australia, for a whole week to mark Australia Day at the end of January, and er the interesting thing from your point of view, is that we are looking for two couples, can be a husband and wife, er mother and daughter, father and son, any combination really, just a couple of friends.
We're looking for two couples to come to Australia with us and to act as roving reporters.
What you do, is er, travel around the country, to selected spots, phone into me, on the programme live, and tell me what you've been doing, what you've been seeing.
All expenses paid, I need hardly add, and of course, this will mean that should you er, get through to the final, you will need to do an audition, live on air, in the day or two before Christmas.
More of that later, you must also have a valid passport, and you must be free to travel in the last two weeks of January.
Okay.
So in five minutes, I'll ask you a question, and that could result in you're going next month with Dougie Down Under, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Seven twenty two.
Leslie of Finsbury.
Good morning Leslie.
Er, Good morning, Douglas.
Em, much earlier you was on about this erm, erm, television licences, er, be it,an another extra twenty pound being added to any, another set over the top of what you've got.
Yes I just want to explain very quickly for people who don't know what we're talking about, Leslie, because a lot of people join us by the minute, er, MPs on the Commons' Heritage Committee, have said, they think it's a very good idea, that if you have more than one telly, you should pay twenty pounds for the second one, and who knows, twenty pounds for the third, and twenty pounds extra for the fourth.
What do you feel?
Well, this is what I'm, what I'm on about, this proposal.
I, I assume it's just a proposal at the moment?
But,i is it 
Yes, it is 
gonna a be across the board?
Or er, just affecting households or is there a special dispensation for hotels, hospitals, commercials, er, commercial establishments, Crown property, Buckingham Palace, and any of the Royal homes, go right through, you can go right through the card?
Well, I think the idea is, that certainly large hotels could afford to pay a bigger collective bill than they're paying at the moment.
And er, er a lot of people I think, would agree with that.
Wouldn't you?
Well, they appear to have, er, er I mean they have televisions in every room, and, and, and they, and they, and they put their prices up accordingly, er en suite, and all this business, but er with the television,
Erm
I mean, they're, they're, actually, they're creaming it off at the moment.
Yeah, I mean, have you got more than one telly?
Sorry?
Have you got more than one?
No, I live on my own, I got, I've got one little television in my own sort of bedsitter.
So, er, would you think it's a good idea maybe to er, to, to charge people twenty pounds extra for each telly?
Well, er, it's all according to whether they can afford it in the first instance, secondly, is it gonna be across the board?
Yes.
I mean, you can't just hammer households, and leave them, I mean, even, even, even like er ju ju the judiciary, the courts, they've all got televisions in their pl I mean surely, and that's Crown property, by the way.
I understand that they don't pay any television licences at all.
Okay Leslie, thank you, a lot of calls coming through on this one.
Inge, from Wembley.
Good morning Inge.
Morning, Dougie.
Er, first of all, good luck for next week
Oh, thank you.
and er, do you know, I've got so many things to say, erm, first of all to do with er, erm, guests at Christmas.
You know, one must remember there are so many lonely people, and Christmas is the worst time of the year.
Yes.
The other thing is television licence.
Now, I must say that I see there is a point of charging for every television set, erm, I don't have any er, er objection to that, but one rider, that senior citizens should be helped.
Yes, I think this is probably the idea behind the thinking, really.
That those who are not really able to pay, who are genuinely hit very hard by the current eighty three pounds, isn't it for a colour television licence, I think?
Er, they would be helped, I think, by this and er, I think if that were to be the case, then I'd be wholeheartedly behind it.
Yes, I think that, I think that would be fair, but er for instance, hotels, establishments, they should of course , pay much more.
Inge, thank you very much indeed.
A lot of calls coming through on this.
We'll take as many as we can er, during the programme.
It's now seven twenty six.
Well here go, with the Dougie Down Under competition, thanks to QUANTAS, Australia's national airline.
Two couples must win the all expenses paid trip to Australia with me, when the Breakfast Call comes live from Sydney, at the end of January.
Now, we've had four questions already this week, if you missed any of them, we will be repeating them next week, so you won't miss out.
But now, here's the final question 

Does anybody else want a biscuit?
Yes please.
might as well.
Anyway can we after, they, they wanted a few predictions.
What was the next thing they also want?
They want  a spread of expenditure for the contract works  So what we agreed with them is that we will forthwith start sending them client reports  and  I've asked them if they will report back to us whether the client reports are in the form they want them.
Because we feel that the client repor Some within the management team feel that the client reports, as we are proposing to issue them are heavy.
In other words there's too much information in them.
So they've agreed to cooperate with us in er putting together a client report or, or, or, or devising client reports which have a minimum of information but the information that they require.
Not the information that we think they require.
An and I'd like that team briefing as well.
Cos it's quite disappointing that we actually er agreed that we'd start issuing client reports about two months, and as far as I'm aware nobody started issuing them.
Leeds North Wes 
gonna have to wait for the erm 
No.
That's done.
That's all done?
A a apart from Chris and Bill, I've sat down with all the M S fours an and been through the changes to the appointment contract, and how they now erm form the basis of the er interim client report.
Th the, the, the interim client report is ready I mean you could use it today.
Erm if that's what people .
Er if you like when I go through it with Chris and Bill, I'll you know invite you in and we'll we'll, we'll, we'll .
you say.
Well so in other words you haven't done the bridge office?
That's right.
Yeah.
Because they weren't available when
Yeah.
when I did everybody else and erm I, I  
Oh yeah.
I'd like to be in on that.
Yeah.
Er but  but the report, er the database has now been rationalized in accordance with the paper I've put to you.
Yeah.
The appointment contracts and variations have been changed in accordance with the paper I've put to you.
The sort of Toytown Railway example is now up and running.
The interim client report which I showed as, again as an example which I provided you a copy with, is now available.
So effectively you've had that information all you've actually got to do is to make sure that the text within the general notes of the 
Mm.
database is relevant and then on all open projects your clerks can produce these reports for your project coordinators to sign off.
The only problem is that the first time you do it for each project if it's a ne if it's a an old project, then we are going to have to put something in  the field which summarizes the total remit for the whole of the group to date.
Er a and that's a one off exercise 
I, I think we should let old projects run the, run the course frankly.
Well  you can't do that with bridge projects Jim.
Y you can in 
Well no.
No.
your office but you can't do it 
We'll put in large ones but I mean I've got a you know 
No.
No.
No.
No.
a hundred projects that will disappear in three months.
That's right.
A a and we just let those disappear and evaporate.
Yeah.
Yes.
I, I'm not for a minute suggesting that er th that for the small projects that we do that.
But most of Roger's projects 
w would need tha that remit.
A and really the remit is nothing other than something like undertake erm er survey work, design, detailed drawings or the reconstruction or repairs to blah blah blah blah including pre-imposed contract work.
End of story.
Unless we vary and  it i i i we just need to put that in.
A and I can get er Ken  and my clerks to ferret through the old contracts, and all the variations that we've had to date, and come up with a suggested erm latest remit for the project coordinator to approve.
If that's what it wants.
I mean er that's a service I'm quite happy to offer.
Erm so really you tell me which jobs you're gonna send reports out on,a and erm that you would like that particular field sorting out, and I will get Ken and Amanda and Kerry to er t to get something in there, so that when you pull it off erm you're happy with it or we can then edit it.
It then g sets the thing right for the next variation as well, cos you use that variation er use that er latest remit within the subsequent variations to the appointment contract.
I've just looked through my notes o of the meeting.
They wanted from us an assurance that we would continue to provide the level of service that we have done in the past.
Because they were concerned about rumours they'd heard of staff shortages within the C E D G.
Perhaps we should be a bit more careful about whingeing about losing staff to Regional Railways and 
other people.
Er a and just get on and bite the bullet and do something about it.
And get on and, that's right.
And get work done.
But they're pinching them.
ridiculous it's their department that's 
taking them all .
Yes.
But if we don't 
But Terry they're the client 
There's a fact of life isn't it?
the client.
Well you didn't have to, yeah.
But we didn't have to, what I mean the point is that we didn't have to tell, have to tell them, they already knew.
They knew that Ian  had taken er or was about to take some  and they knew that er
Yeah.
But you've got, you haven't got a problem with  
that old Brian  's gone.
but I, I, as I understand it you haven't got a problem with workload.
In fac I, from what I understand is that you've got a problem with shortage of workload.
Yeah.
Well I can't stop their perception of the fact that the staff that are disappearing out of the office come from the P T section.
Yeah.
But .
You can't stop it but you can influence it.
I mean if, if our, if, if we're going around whingeing that  a 
But we're not.
shortage of staff, but that was their perception Terry.
Their perception was that we, we had a desperate shortage of staff
Yeah.
and we weren't gonna provide them with the level of service that  
They got the 
They got the feeling that we were on the ropes and I, I mean if
even if we are we should we should be managing that internally.
No.
No.
What I,w w what we've done is we've assured them that we will provide the level of service that they've had previously and if need be 
we will buy staff in,
Yeah.
agency staff or whatever,
Yeah.
to continue to provide them with that service.
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah.
Aye actually you do need 
That's an assurance that we've given them.
Yes.
A actually that rumour though hasn't come from us so the comment about whingeing was wrong.
I'm not bothered about where it comes from.
No.
But it wasn't but you see it's the fact that Ian  's gone.
R Bob  's gone.
Brian  's gone.
Robert  's gone.
All within the past about eighteen months and they were all from P T fro from Regional Railways P T type jobs.
Tha that's what's happened.
Fine.
They've picked up their own vibes.
Don't take it negatively.
Mm.
The, the, the positive message is that 
Yeah.
we've given them assurance that we will provide the level of service 
.
Good.
and we need to do it.
Mm.
The second thing is that erm with regard to future pro projects, Regional Railways have decreed, that we will only get work through competitive tender.
No.
Regional Railways North East Investment have decreed that we will only get work
Yeah.
on competitive tender.
Okay.
I understood it was Regional Railways 
It was those  
Headquarters who'd decreed that we would only get work by  
Yeah.
I can't see
It's  it's
I 
I 
Right.
Okay.
I I I'll I'll check that 
Can you?
with Richard  then and see 
Yeah.
whether or not we're gonna be in the same situation on erm
on maintenance jobs.
Yeah.
I see this as a positive element because here for once the client's gonna have to sit down and produce a specification 
Put down  remit.
and a remit.
Right.
I don't think they've realized  
And then we will go into bat on a fixed price and we'll charge him that, whatever.
And if there's a variation order we will issue a variation order  
And we will become 
variation.
we will become more professional 
Correct.
on those jobs.
And it will cost him more money administrating.
Er that 
doesn't matter i it, it, it, it will 
be a good exercise for us t to take advantage over this er 
I've warned them   .?
Yeah.
I I, what I would say cos we will be competing against Birmingham and Glasgow.
Right?
We retain the work that we've already got with them.
Okay?
And th then we've got a lot of work at the moment which we'll retain.
The future projects we're gonna have to obtain competitively.
So we're te we're team briefing that as well?
Yes.
Yes.
Are we team briefing it North East, or the whole of Regional Railways?
Let's say that we have been, we've been 
Stick with North East  
advised by the New Works Manager of Regional Railways North East that work from him
Mm.
Will be 
w will be o only obtained via competitive 
We'll have to compete for .
tender.
Now the relevant point about briefing this is a you've mentioned Glasgow and Birmingham that I already knew about, that we're tendering against.
But there is was some intimation that it would go externally as well.
Right .
Right.
I, I can't comment on that Terry that is not something 
Well 
that Keith's
right.
Okay.
But he certainly didn't suggest that.
No.
A a a and that's gonna cause him all sorts of admin type er
Specification problems.
Yes.
well specification and training I mean what's he gonna do about getting people 
P P T S 
on the track?
That, that's not my understanding 
I don't think that's 
at the moment.
No.
Okay.
Now I think as a management team we need to think about what our strategy, our tactics are gonna be with regard to this.
Erm because if we look at our experiences with Crossrail, if you d w what do we do?
Do we go in low?
No.
And then, and then, then try and get money on the  
If I was tender if, if 
go in?
But .
No.
But if, if our fee bids, that have been going in so far, are there or thereabouts and having monitored  reports for quite a while, tendencies and yes some are under and some are a bit over but in general they're not th they're not that far out.
Then we've gotta, we've gotta continue to tender on that same footing.
We can't buy every job.
But a w a word 
a word of er caution 
here is it's, it's er, er 
a bad scene that it's only gonna be on certain jobs.
If I can just quote our experience er on this, erm 
we, I was able to compare our costs for design at Hounslow just er in the, just er south of Rug Rugby.
Mhm.
Birmingham quoted six thousand.
We actually did the job for just under five.
Er that wasn't er on competition though,th that was er an Intercity job which Birmingham said they could do it for that figure.
Mm.
Where we've been doing comparable work on er the Kings Cross Project, we wer we told by the old project team that we were very much cheaper than Birmingham.
And better but that was another story.
When we actually went to competitive tender, which was for a route improvement down near Leicester, they undercut us.
The w we put in what we thought was a completely fair er, er quotation for what we were doing.
Bearing in mind we have the more difficult travelling but they undercut us.
And my suspicion is they put in a selectively low bid on that particular job.
Erm we also lost out on permanent way standard drawings against the Glasgow office who were desperate for work.
Mm.
They put in th er a cheap price.
They got the entire work.
They ran out of money, and they've had to be supplemented since to get the job finished.
S so they were
That's why it's precisely 
they were 
.
Thank you for that .
But on that Leic th th the Leicester job that you l erm
The  line?
Yeah.
You'd adopted the same philosophy of pricing that.
You ha because you suddenly realized you were 
price sensibly.
in competitive tender you didn't change your philosophy?
Yeah.
I think you've got to price sensibly.
I, I, I did not.
Er, er w we costed out the 
job how we were going to do it our normal procedure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm.
The only thing I didn't have control of w were the rates we're charging.
I mean
Mm.
purely departmentally I 
Mm.
could have t have knocked about twenty percent off my rates and still got them even.
Which incidentally would have been enough to get the job.
Yeah.
Er 
Yeah.
but erm beware.
It it's a bad scene when it's i if, if it's universal, if they, if they're put in  bids eventually they'll bankrupt themselves.
But when it's selective 
and they've got a whole market to go 
Mm.
back on, erm
They're in a .
my experience is they, they, they put in artificially low bids.
Be because they're owned by Regional Railways and Re i if they lose money Regional Railways will .
But why aren't Intercity asking Birmingham to tender against us for Intercity jobs?
Don't even think about it.
L let, let it
Yeah.
We don't want to work hard.
th that I've thought about very seriously but, but Terry, think about this.
What proportion of their work is Intercity?
Compared with what proportion of our work is Regional Railways?
Tt I wouldn't know.
Anyway that looks like the only tribute problem for this financial year isn't it?
Because next financial 
Mm.
year if we're still within B R we certainly won't 
be part of erm
Intercity?
Intercity or Regional Railways.
That's right.
So Birmingham won't be part of Regional Railways.
I mean we'll be back to the scenario that we were fighting for three years ago.
That's right.
Mm.
So that we can perhaps get 
Well perhaps  
some method of 
Mm.
cooperation within 
Mm.
the other .
Aye.
Yeah.
I 
The last thing we want to do is to start infighting on the S A Us 
Fighting them on the .
because
Mm.
we'll 
Ee 
just do what the, what the industry outside has done and spiral down into producing lower and lower quality of services 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hear hear.
and not 
Yeah.
serving anybody.
Well I've not  
We did make we did make this point to Keith  actually very very clearly,
Yeah.
that we w that we are concerned that what will happen is that everybody will start putting silly low 
prices in and t a and one of two things will happen.
Either th the quality of service will go down, or he will have all the hassle of er not knowing, not knowing what his design 
Sorting out what he shouldn't be sorting out 
costs are gonna be.
Well I just thi 
Because he'll be getting clobbered with claims all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So they're difficult times.
I think our strategy should be that we pare our prices down, to the absolute minimum that we think we can do the work for, take a little bit more off that and hope to get some money back on variations.
Because if you don't get a job you don't even have the chance of doing the work.
Mm.
I don't, mm I  I'm not too happy with that 
Yeah.
Well 
philosophy
well
Well I'm not happy with it 
th th that 
but I, I just think it's a matter of
I'll, I'll go along with that Rog er Hugh, provided that we 
Forty five percent of our work is taking a bit off when we don't  money gonna make any 
money.
Perhaps i i it'll encourage us to look for a shorter route through to the, the, the solution.
But th the problem is all the shortcuts are g gonna reduce the quality of service we give to the client.
Like at the moment if there's anything goes wrong with possessions, it really ought to be the project manager sorting it out.
Yes.
Exactly.
Quite.
But we don't do that.
We sort that out for him.
Well 
Well 
perhaps we shouldn't 
it shouldn't 
Yeah.
Yeah but that 
perhaps, perhaps that'll fall  
Right.
to
Right.
But, but you see the point I'm getting at?
It's the same with Lookouts as well.
If there's a problem with Lookouts we do it and we  
for him we also 
Mm.
look after all his safety issues.
The, the problem is if it it's alright to out-price and then reducing your service, but that soon switches the client off.
Yes it does.
I'll go along
But Terry one 
A and that's just as dangerous
once he's 
as overpricing it.
once he starts to  
Isn't it?
If he starts getting, go on.
once he starts to specify in a contract document, what we are pricing for, then we've got an immediate, okay, we've done this for you and this is
Yeah.
we've done this on a 
time rate and it's, it's extra.
But the, the vibes are bad.
But please pay us.
The vibes are bad
No because
it would be  
because a all consultants are gonna do that.
The vibes are bad.
.
Who sorted out the problems with all the possessions and supervision for Leeds North West?
Yeah.
Me and Roger.
Not the bloody project manager.
Terry the vibes are wrong 
all the way round.
Yeah.
Whatever we do it is 
a risky situation.
Well I
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let us  
I'm happy to pare the job down Hugh but I'm not happy 
to start taking money off.
No.
There's a big difference between us and consultants isn't there?
Because if you 
Yeah.
Yeah.
were outside, and you were running jobs really tight, flexitime 
Yeah.
would go out of the window, staff would be working what hours, whatever hours were necessary to 
get it inside 
the job.
Yeah.
Not only that staff 
be silly expense claims and all this 
staff salaries staff salaries wou let's be fair.
Outside 
Go out the window.
staff salaries have gone down over the last eighteen months 
Too .
I was speaking to a lad who left my office 
to go to a consultant.
And he's been there now about three years and they're just surviving, and he's says, I'm earning roughly what I was here but I'm working literally twice the hours.
And he says, and if I don't, I don't have a job.
That's the reality of the situation.
Correct.
And I, I, I think we've, we've  
.
He has to get the job done for a price.
We've got to be very careful we're not tying our hands behind our backs.
No.
We can't play that game.
.
Yes we can.
B but Terry let us  look at the 
Oh yes we can.
other thing.
If, if we don't
We haven't decided that.
if we don't work on the strategy that I've been suggesting
putting it on the table If you don't do that, I can guarantee that Bill , Bill  is gonna play silly buggers.
That I am certain of and Bill is gonna put in silly prices.
But it won't do any good though will it?
But it won't do us any good either cos we won't have any work to do.
It depends who gets in first doesn't it?
Really?
What do you mean?
What?
Mm?
What do you mean by get in first?
Well in first 
is getting the bloody job.
Well no.
If we  have a  if we have a  
There's no w what are you?
Let's, let's 
done in that way to 
Yeah.
start with and let him .
But you've already said forty five percent of our business
Is with
is with Regional Railways if we're 
I know.
gonna take forty five percent of our business at less than the cost to do the job, that don't make good business sense.
No.
No.
No.
What we're saying is that, that we're gonna have we we're gonna put a bid in 
put a bid in at a certain price.
and then we're gonna, we're gonna  work down 
We're gonna w 
to that price.
Or 
Or recover it.
Or recover it.
Or recover it.
By identifying gaps in their documentation in the same way as .
But then you get back to what Terry said about,bloody York 
you'll really switch off him.
you know.
They look for everything.
Yeah.
Right
Erm
Roger.
Yeah.
you don't get the work.
You don't get the work but then you 
But what do you want?
No.
But you 
you don't need to work for anything do you?
want the hassle of getting the money?
No.
or do you?
No.
I think that  
o o or  that I would want the hassle and not get the work.
I think I think what we ought to do is we ought to  point out 
these problems at a
Oh we've covered that.
We've covered that.
We've pointed that out, to Keith.
It's, I mean what you've gotta be is, is realistic.
Keith's 
A and realize that K Keith, it's not Keith's decision.
It's not in Keith's  
if Keith had the, the decision to make he would continue working with us.
There's no doubt about it.
It's outside of Keith, I think it's outside of David .
And I believe it's with Richard  
Yeah.
Well 
.
going to miss us a great opportunity to learn how to do it right  
it's a great opportunity.
Yeah.
it is.
It's an opportunity we're gonna have now which in two years time
Yeah.
But, but don't 
we will not have 
Can we just put it 
because .
Absolutely.
put it in perspective though?
But don't knock any money off.
All I say is, if we're gonna pare it down, let's pare it down before we start the job and put in the price it will cost.
Right.
Can I, can I, can I, can I re 
Including knocking off photographs  if they say they're gonna want photographs.
Right?
Correct.
So they don't get them.
So they don't get them.
Don't  the cost 
.
No.
You see what this, I'll tell you what this says 
the staff costs it's the staff costs you've got to control 
Yes.
If the staff can't to 
do it at within the cost, outside,
Mm.
then staff simply work for nothing.
It's as simple as that.
They have to work for nothing to get the job done.
Yeah.
Mm.
That's a reality, and I don't see why this office should not consider the fact that they may have to get involved in that.
We may very well 
Well  
have to do that.
but until he shows national agreements to them you'll never get that agreed will ?
Well some of them 
?
are not national agreements.
What, what erm makes you think  
they are and you can't 
Bill   
People work overtime and they get paid for it.
by what he's done so far in .
Full stop.
more payment.
Yeah.
Right.
Bill Bill has 
Standard conditions.
Bill has worked  very hard to preserve Glasgow's position
Mm.
in terms of, I mean Bill was the one who drafted up the 
th the rules of er distribution of work between 
Mhm.
organizations.
It was his idea.
He got it written er if you remember the rules of the game are that all Regional Railways work will go to a Regional Railways office and they will decide if it goes out.
If it goes out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ditto for Intercity erm  intentionally I've played a very low profile game on this.
And if you like ignored those because we had more to lose.
Yeah.
But that's the only reason why.
If I'd been in Bill's position I, or if we'd had been in Bill's position, we'd have done the same as well.
And said, bloody hell.
Glasgow are doing all this Intercity work.
If they were.
We should be doing that.
So erm  t they're fighting to survive, we're fighting to survive.
And, and they're not gonna, they're not gonna behave as er real gentlemen Roger.
I can promise you.
They're gon gonna be interested in that 
Oh n no.
work.
You can commit suicide as well if you're daft can't you?
Yeah.
Erm 
J just to put it in perspective 
you know.
erm Hugh said that er it doesn't apply to jobs that we've already got.
And
At the moment
