= = = Boston accent = = =
The Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English. It is spoken specifically in the city of Boston, its suburbs, and much of eastern Massachusetts. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire and Maine. The accent originated with the Puritans who came to the area from East Anglia in the 17th century. It was also influenced by 19th and 20th century immigrants from Ireland. This resulted in the distinct r-dropping (locally called "wicked natural") dialect found in modern costal Massachusetts.
Non-rhoticity.
The traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers tend to use more of a rhotic accent than older speakers from the Boston region. The Boston accent is pronounced with a “broad A”. The letter "r" is dropped only in certain words like 'car' and 'hard'. For example, a person might “pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.”
Lexicon.
Some words used in the Boston area are:

City ordinance 176874, adopted September 4, 2002, sets the design and what it means. Green stands for "the forests and our green City"; yellow for "agriculture and commerce"; blue for "our rivers". Portland is on the Willamette River near its joining with the Columbia River. City Ordinance 186794, adopted September 3, 2014, updated the proportions and the Pantone color specifications: White, PMS 279 (Blue); PMS 349 (Green); and PMS 1235 (Yellow).
The flag was designed in 1969 by a longtime Portland resident, graphic designer R. Douglas Lynch (1913–2009). The version of the flag adopted at that time included, over Lynch's objections, a dark blue canton containing the city seal in yellow and white; in 2002 Lynch and fellow members of the Portland Flag Association persuaded the city council to simplify the design to better reflect his original intent.

= = = Flash Airlines Flight 604 = = =
Flash Airlines Flight 604, a Boeing 737-300, was a flight from Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to Paris, France, via Cairo. On January 3, 2004 the plane crashed into the Red Sea just moments after take-off at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. All 135 passengers and 13 crew members on-board the plane died. The cause of the crash remains disputed, but it was suggested to be spatial disorientation by the Captain.
The crash remains Egypt's deadliest air-disaster, until the bombing of Kogalymavia Flight 9268, with 224 deaths. The crash is also the worst crash of a Boeing 737-300.
The flight took off at 04:44 Eastern European Time (0244 GMT) from runway 22R at the Egyptian resort en route to Paris via Cairo. After taking off, the aircraft should have climbed and initiated a left turn to follow the air corridor to Cairo designated by the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. The captain appeared surprised when the autopilot was engaged, which he immediately switched off again. The copilot warned the captain that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right, the captain said "OK come out".
The ailerons were briefly returned to neutral before being commanded to increase the bank to the right, likely by the captain in a state of surprise. The aircraft reached an altitude of 5,460 feet (1,660 m) with a 50-degree bank when the copilot exclaimed "Overbank" repeatedly when the bank angle kept increasing. The bank angle was 111 degrees right, while the pitch attitude was 43 degrees nose down at an altitude of 3,470 feet (1,060 m).
The observer on the flight deck, also a pilot, but a trainee on this 737 variant, shouted "Retard power, retard power, retard power", to get the captain to pull the throttles back so that the aircraft stopped gaining speed. Both throttles were moved to idle; the captain appeared to regain control of the airplane. However the speed increased, activating the overspeed warning.
At 04:45, the aircraft impacted the water about 8.2 nautical miles (15.2 km) south of the airport. The impact occurred while the aircraft was in a 24 degree right bank, 24 degree nose-down attitude, travelling at 416 knots (770 km/h, 478 mph,) and pulling 3.9g (38 m/22). All 148 passengers and crew were lost.
Most of the passengers aboard the flight were French tourists from the Paris metropolitan area. A provisional passenger list, dated January 5 January 2004, stated that twelve entire French families had boarded the flight.

= = = Jacques I, Prince of Monaco = = =
Jacques Goÿon, Count of Matignon ("Jacques François Léonor"; 21 November 1689 – 23 April 1751) was Count of Thorigny and Matignon. He was also the Prince of Monaco as Jacques I after his marriage to Princess Louis Hippolyte of Monaco. He also built the Hôtel Matignon.
Life.
Jacques was born in Normandy. His father was the Count of Matignon. Jacques became the Count of Matignon in 1675 when his father died. Jacques married Princess Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi of Monaco.
Issue.
The children of the couple were technically given the surname of "Goyon" after their father however they were sometimes also known under the surname of Grimaldi too.

Stefán Karl Stefánsson (; ; 10 July 1975 – 21 August 2018) was an Icelandic actor and singer. He was best known for playing antagonist Robbie Rotten on the children's television series "LazyTown".
Career.
Stefán Karl's career started in 1994. At the age of 19, he worked as a puppeteer for television. During his years as a puppeteer, he had also been studying at the Drama Academy of Iceland. However, he was not satisfied with how Iceland views their drama standards. He remembered that his principal at his high school said that "acting is not about making faces and changing your face". He did not agree with his high school principal.
Later, Stefán Karl had been invited by Magnús Scheving, an Icelandic gymnast, to portray one of the characters in the second "LazyTown" play. Scheving created the plays because he was concerned that Iceland's younger generation is not doing enough exercise. Stefán Karl explained that "[Scheving] wanted the kids to get healthier, so he created this musical called "LazyTown". He played Sportacus, the fitness fanatic, and I was Robbie Rotten, the guy who liked to stay indoors and sleep". After initial success with the musical, Nickelodeon eventually made a deal with the creators of "LazyTown" to air the first 40 episodes of "LazyTown" along with a special studio built in Iceland. During the first few years of "LazyTown" in the early 2000s, Stefán Karl initially knew no English, but soon became fluent.

On the same month, GoFundMe campaign was subsequently created by "LazyTown" head writer Mark Valenti to pay his living costs when he became too ill to work. The campaign was popularized by various YouTube users uploading parodies of Stefán Karl's work. This eventually made the songs "We Are Number One" and "The Mine Song" from "LazyTown" become Internet memes. In August 2017, Stefán Karl stated he was in remission. He clarified on his GoFundMe campaign that while his metastases had been removed after successful liver surgery in June 2017, he still had the disease and had refused further adjuvant therapy.
In March 2018, Stefán Karl was diagnosed with inoperable bile duct cancer, and said that he was undergoing chemotherapy to increase the length of his life. In April 2018, he announced that he personally chose to stop his chemotherapy, and then began to shut down all his social media accounts.

= = = Guiana Shield = = =
The Guiana Shield is a geographic region found in northeast South America. It is one of the three cratons of the South American Plate. It is a 1.7 billion-year-old Precambrian geological formation that forms part of the South American northern coast.
The higher elevations on the region are called the Guiana Highlands, which is where there are mesas or "table" mountains called "tepuis".
Names.
"Guiana" and "The Guianas" are often used as collective names for Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, and sometimes even includes the portions of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil which are on the Guiana Shield.
Geography.
The Guiana Shield is In six countries; they are, from west to east:
The Guiana Shield is roughly bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Orinoco river to the north and west, the Negro river (an important tributary of the Amazon river) to the southwest, and the Amazon river to the south.
Mountains.
The Guiana Highlands is formed by small plateaus and mountain ranges. The western part of the Highlands, mainly in Venezuela, is where are the higher mountains. From west to east, the mountains ranges and plateaus are:
The highest point in the Guiana Shield is Pico da Neblina () in Brazil at . Pico da Neblina is the highest summit of the larger "Serra do Imeri", a plateau on the Venezuela-Brazil border; it is also the highest mountain in Brazil.
Rivers and waterfalls.
Many rivers start on the Guiana Highlands and most of them flow to the north, into the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them are:
In the region there are some notable waterfalls such as the Angel Falls, high, in Venezuela, and the Kaieteur Falls, high, on the Potaro River in the Pacaraima Mountains of Guyana.
Climate.
As a whole, the Guiana Shield region has a tropical climate characterized by a relatively high mean annual temperature over at sea level. Because of the Guiana Shield is just north of the equator, its climate varies primarily according to elevation and the effects of the trade winds. The trade winds blow from the east and northeast, off of the Atlantic Ocean onto northeastern South America.
The heaviest rains usually occur between May and August, whereas the rainy season from December to January is shorter and less intense, with rains mostly along the coast. In areas where there is only one rainy season, the driest part of the year is January to March; in areas where there are two rainy seasons the driest months are March and October. However, even during most dry seasons, frequent storms provide adequate moisture to allow evergreen tropical moist forests to persist in most low elevation parts of the region.
The climate data for Santa Elena de Uairén weather station () in La Gran Sabana at an altitude of are:.
Plant and animal life.
Since the individual peaks in the Guiana Highlands have been isolated from each other for millions of years, many plants and animals have evolved in a different way on each mountain.
Many of the mountains are covered in permanent clouds and mist washing all the soil away, and leaving barren rock and water. Because of this many plants are carnivorous and feed on insects and small animals.
So far over 2,000 species of plants been found, and more than 50% are endemic to this region, meaning they are found only here, and many are only found on one peak.

Care should be taken, because the hornets may sting without warning. The pain from the sting may persist for a few days with swelling.

= = = Hotepsekhemwy = = =
Hotepsekhemwy was an early Egyptian king, the first ruler of the Second Dynasty. It is not known how long he ruled. The Turin King List has him ruling for 95 years. The Ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of "Boëthôs" lasted for 38 years. Egyptologists now believe Hotepsekhemwy ruled for either 25 or 29 years.
Name sources.
Hotepsekhemwy's name has been found at Saqqara, Giza, Badari and Abydos, on clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.
The Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy may give clues to the politics of the time. The Egyptian word "Hotep" means "peaceful", "to be pleased", and also "conciliation" or "to be reconciled". So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as "the two powers are reconciled" or "pleasing in powers". This suggests a significant political meaning. "The two powers" could be Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.
From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the nebty name in the same way. The Horus name has a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also show, that the Horus name was used when becoming king.
Family.
The name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. There could be a son, Perneb, who had the titles “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu”. The clay seals with Perneb's name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which belonged to two kings equally, Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb. It is not possible to know which was his father.
Identity.
Hotepsekhemwy is known from lists made at the time of Ramesses II. The name "Bedjau" is found on the Abydos king list, "Bedjatau" from Giza, "Netjer-Bau" from the Sakkara king list and the name "Bau-hetepju" is on the Turin King List. A similar name, "Bedjatau", is on a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. "Bedjatau" means "the foundryman". This is thought to be a misreading of the name "Hotepsekhemwy". The hieroglyphic signs used to write "Hotep" are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two "Sekhem"sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this Old Kingdom name form of “Bedjatau”. The names "Netjerbau" and "Bau-hetepju" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.
Reign.
Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Evidence shows he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife. During this time there were several kings who only ruled for a very short time, such as Horus "Bird" and Sneferka. Sneferka could be a name used by king Qaa for a short time. The tomb of king Qaa was robbed at the end of First dynasty, and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The robbing of the cemetery and the conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. The kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were left out of later king lists, perhaps because their struggles for the Egyptian throne led to the collapse of the first dynasty.
A new royal residence called "Horus the shining star" built for Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the god "Netjer-Achty" and founded the "Chapel of the White Crown". The white crown, the hedjet, is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is a clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, and shows a likely source of political power. There is no mention of a Sed festival,which shows that Hotepsekhemwy cannot have ruled longer than 30 years. The Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary for a reign of 30 years.
The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reported that during his reign, "a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two thousand years later – the story may be based on fact, as the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.
Tomb.
The location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Some Egyptologists believe it could be the giant underground "Gallery Tomb B" beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Others think that "Gallery Tomb B" is the burial site of king Raneb. Several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there.

= = = Bullet cluster = = =
The Bullet cluster (1E 0657-558) consists of two colliding clusters of galaxies. Strictly speaking, the name "Bullet cluster" refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 x 109 parsecs (3.7 billion light-years).
Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. However, this interpretation of the gravitational lensing results is disputed. Observations of other galaxy cluster collisions, such as MACS J0025.4-1222, are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter.
Mordehai Milgrom, the original proposer of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), has posted on-line a rebuttal of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Milgrom claims that MOND correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters, and even in clusters such as the Bullet Cluster it removes the need for most dark matter, leaving only a factor of two which Milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter (non-luminous baryonic matter) rather than cold dark matter. Without MOND, or some similar theory, the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10, i.e. MOND reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2.

= = = Skyros = = =
Skyros is an island of the east coast of Greece. It is the southernmost island of the Sporades, an archipelago in the Aegean Sea. Around the 2nd millennium BC and slightly later, the island was known as "The Island of the Magnetes". Later it was called "Pelasgia" and "Dolopia". Finally it got the name Skyros. At it is the largest of the Sporades. The island has a population of about 3,000 (in 2011). The Hellenic Air Force has a major base in Skyros, because of the island's strategic location in the middle of the Aegean. It is a popular tourist location. Skyros is the resting place of Rupert Brooke, the British poet.
In Skyros lives a small horse whose height is about 90 to 110 centimeters. This horse is a rare breed and does not exist anywhere else in the world. This fact makes it a valuable animal species and is of great scientific interest. It is a petite and fine-boned animal. His head is somewhat thick, but with large intelligent eyes and large nostrils. The neck is very strong and thick in proportion to the shoulder blades and sternum, which are narrow and sharp. The head looks like a single piece, with the very muscular neck, thick and triangular where it meets the head. His mane is long and rich with a color always darker than the skin and mixed with silver hairs. 

= = = Garden of the Sanhedrin Tombs = = =
The Tombs of the Sanhedrin is a series of tombs in Jerusalem, Israel. The tombs are cut into the rock underground. It was named after the Sanhedrin - courts of judges that were chosen in every city of ancient Israel.
History.
The cave was cleared in 1903 by the American archaeologist G. A. Burton. In 1950, archaeologist Yotam Julius Rothschild finished excavating the cave (clearing it out completely, so he could see what was inside). In the cave was a coffin with the name "Isaac" written on it. The coffin was taken to France, and today it is in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
Many burial caves were found in the Sanhedrin caves. The whole area is part of the necropolis, a very big, underground cemetery used during the Second Temple period in Jerusalem. There are a few reasons why this area in Jerusalem has so many burial caves. First, the area was used for stone quarrying - taking huge pieces of stone out of the ground to use them to build things. This left large caves. Also, at the time, rich people in Jerusalem liked the idea of burial caves. This made the idea of a necropolis easier and popular.

= = = The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise = = =
"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise" is a comedy routine. It was first shown during episode 22 of the first season of "Saturday Night Live" on May 29, 1976. The routine is twelve minutes long. It was written by Michael O'Donoghue consulting with actor John Belushi. They included a realistic model of the "USS Enterprise" bridge from the TV show "Star Trek". Dress rehearsal was hard. The writer was not sure if Belushi would be able to do a good parody of William Shatner's performance as Captain Kirk. The routine was a success. O'Donoghue immediately congratulated Belushi after his performance.
The sketch became an instant classic hit among "Star Trek" fans and science fiction fans. The 1977 book "Saturday Night Live" included a copy of a note from "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry where he called the comedic bit "delicious". The routine was released on a 1985 "Saturday Night Live" videotape that combined "The Best of John Belushi". It was released again with the same title in DVD format in 2011.
Reviews.
In his book "Metapop", author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit one of the most famous scenes from "Saturday Night Live". The "Chicago Sun-Times" called it a really intelligent parody of "Star Trek". "Huffpost TV" called it one of "the most famous parodies" of "Star Trek". "The A.V. Club" said the sketch was really well-done comedy.
"The New Yorker" movie critic Anthony Lane wrote that Belushi did a perfect acting job. "The Hollywood Reporter" interviewed Tom Hanks and Elliott Gould in 2015. Gould called the sketch a favorite. Hanks said it was one of the top five best of all time. "Rolling Stone" ranked every "Saturday Night Live" cast member by talent in 2015, and John Belushi was placed at number one. "Rolling Stone" said the Captain Kirk parody was one of Belushi's best.
