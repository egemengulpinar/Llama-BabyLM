The Addams Family (1991) is an American movie based on the cartoon by Charles Addams and the TV series by David Levy. It was the first movie directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. A sequel was released in 1993.
Plot.
Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) misses his brother Fester (Christopher Lloyd), who left 25 years earlier after they had a big fight. Gomez's lawyer, Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), owes money to Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson), and notices that her adopted son, Gordon looks like Fester. Tully tells Gordon to pretend to be Fester to get close to the Addams family and find their riches. Tully and his wife, Margaret (Dana Ivey), join Grandmama to try to talk to Fester's ghost. Gordon arrives, pretending to be Fester, and Abigail tells the family Fester has been in the Bermuda Triangle.
Gomez takes him to the family vault to watch home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns that Gomez was jealous of Fester, and he dated the Amor twins to get even with Fester. Gomez starts to think that this is not the real Fester. Gordon tries to return to the vault, but can't get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife, Morticia (Anjelica Huston), threatens the fake Fester, saying how much the Addamses love family, and don't trust outsiders.
Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), and he teaches them about swords for a school play. Fake Fester goes to the play, even though Abigail told him not to do so. After the play, Abigail says fake Fester must go away again, so the Addamses throw a large party. Wednesday hears Abigail and Gordon talking about plans to break into the vault. Tully learns that Fester, as the biggest brother, owns all of the Addams property. The Addamses' neighbor, Judge George Womack (Paul Benedict), helps the bad guys kick the Addamses out of their house.
Abigail, Gordon and Tully try and fail many times to get past the booby trap blocking the vault. The Addams family must move to a motel and get jobs. Morticia tries being a preschool teacher, Wednesday and Pugsley sell poisoned lemonade, and Thing (Christopher Hart)—the family's living hand—becomes a "delivery hand." Gomez is too sad to work.
Morticia returns to the Addams home and Abigail and Tully catcher her and punish her, trying to learn how to get in the vault. Thing sees them and tells Gomez. The Addamses rush to save Morticia. Abigail threatens to kill Morticia unless they give her their money. Gordon stops Abigail. He uses a magic book to make a storm hit the house. Lightening strikes his head and launches Tully and Abigail out a window and into graves Wednesday and Pugsley had dug.
Gordon's memory returns after the lightening strike, and he remembers that he was the real Fester all along. Morticia tells Gomez that she is pregnant.

An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump began on September 24, 2019, when Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced in a televised speech the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. 
It began after President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani repeatedly wanted the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, in what was seen as an attempt to hurt Biden's candidacy for president and for Trump to gain advantages in the 2020 election.
In July prior to the phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump stopped military aid to Ukraine; he released the hold in September.
Further revelations have been revealed, including; President Trump claiming to Russian officials in 2017 that he was unconcerned with Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participating in the phone call to the Ukrainian President despite not being present in the released memo from the Trump Administration, as well as President Trump also pressuring Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a phone call to investigate the origins of the Mueller Report in an attempt to discredit it. 
On October 28, 2019, Speaker Pelosi announced she would hold a floor vote on a resolution to formally establish the procedures for the impeachment hearings. On October 31, 2019, the House voted 232–196 to create procedures for public hearings.
The inquiry ended on December 3. On December 5, Nancy Pelosi asked the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump. On December 16, the House Judiciary Committee released a report specifying criminal bribery and wire fraud charges as part of the abuse of power charge. The house voted to impeach Trump on December 18, 2019. On February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both count. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count.

= = = First impeachment of Donald Trump = = =
The first impeachment of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, began on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that Trump had pressured foreign leaders. The scandal was about Trump telling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and his father Joe Biden, a former vice-president and a candidate for the 2020 presidential election. It ended on February 5, 2020.
House trial.
The inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019. In October 2019, three Congressional committees (Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs) deposed witnesses.
In November 2019, the House Intelligence Committee held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly. On December 3, the House Intelligence Committee voted 13–9 along party lines to adopt a final report.
A set of impeachment hearings before the Judiciary Committee began on December 4, 2019. On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Judiciary Committee also released a report on the articles of impeachment on December 16.
The first hearing, held on December 4, 2019, was an academic discussion on the definition of an impeachable offense. The witnesses invited by Democrats were law professors Noah Feldman from Harvard, Pamela S. Karlan from Stanford, and Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina. Republicans invited Jonathan Turley, a constitutional scholar at George Washington University.
On December 18, the full House approved the articles of impeachment, making Trump the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
Senate trial.
On January 10, 2020, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had "asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate".
At the end of the January 21 session, the Senate voted along party lines to pass Mitch McConnell's proposed trial rules and reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats. The prosecution's opening arguments and presentation of evidence took place between January 22–24. Trump's defense presentation began on January 25. The primary arguments were a lack of direct evidence of wrongdoing, and that Democrats were attempting to use the impeachment to steal the 2020 election. Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict the president.
Verdict.
On February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both count. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count.

Different responses to the treaty were a reason why there was conflict between whites and Indians. This led to the Colorado War of 1864, including the Sand Creek Massacre.
Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851).
The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho says that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were supposed to have a very big amount of territory in the area between the North Platte River and Arkansas River and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. This area included present-day southeastern Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska, most of eastern Colorado, and the westernmost parts of Kansas. However, in November 1858, people found gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado (then part of the western Kansas Territory). This created a gold rush. A lot of white people went across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. Colorado territory officials asked federal authorities to change the size of Indians lands in the treaty. In Fall 1860, A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, came to Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to make a new treaty.
Treaty of Fort Wise (1861).
On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States. This was at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers. This was near what is now Lamar, Colorado. Lamar had been recently leased by the U.S. Government, and the name changed to Fort Wise. The Native Americans gave most of the lands given to them by the Fort Laramie treaty to the United States.

It was operated by Golden Eagle Aviation.
It was one of two aircraft carrying the Wichita State University football team to Logan, Utah. They were going to Utah for a game against Utah State University. The other plane flew a normal route and arrived safely in Utah. Pilot errors, including bad in-flight choices and bad pre-flight planning, were officially reported as what caused the crash.

= = = Windshield = = =
The windshield (American English) or windscreen (Commonwealth English) is the front window of a vehicle. It lets drivers see out while at the same time protecting passengers and the driver from weather. Aircraft, cars, buses, motorbikes or trams can all have windshields. 
Windshields on cars and aircraft are designed to protect the vehicle against wind and flying debris (such as dust, rocks, and insects). Windshields on motorbikes are designed to shield the driver from wind, though it doesn't protect as much as other vehicle windshields do.
Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass. The laminated safety glass used for vehicles is made of two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer between them. This laminated safety glass is then joined into the window frame. 
Motorbike windshields are different to the ones found on cars or aircraft. Motorbike windshields are often made of high-impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic.
History.
Before laminated safety glass, vehicles used ordinary window glass as a windshield. However, ordinary window glass can shatter if the vehicle had a massive physical impact, which would produce flying sharp pieces of glass that can injure people. On 1917, Henry Ford developed the laminated safety glass from the French, which would help prevent broken glass from shattering. Modern windshields were developed from Ford's developments.

= = = Archaic period (North America) = = =
In the classification of the , the Archaic period or "Meso-Indian period" in North America, starts from about 8000 BC, and it ends at about 1000 BC. In the sequence of North American pre-Columbian cultural stages, is a period defined by the "archaic stage" of cultural development. 
The Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies. These economies were supported through the use of nuts, seeds, and shellfish. Because it ended when people started using sedentary farming, this date can be different by a lot across the Americas.
The rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period.
Classifications.
This classification system was first proposed by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in the widely accepted 1958 book "Method and Theory in American Archaeology".
In the organization of the system, the Archaic period is after the Lithic stage. The Archaic period is before the Formative stage.

= = = Thatching = = =
Thatching is building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw, reeds, sedge ("Cladium mariscus"), rushes, heather, or palm branches. The vegetation is put on top of each other so as to make sure water stays away from the inner roof.
Thatch can occasionally catch fire. This is one reason for its replacement by slates in modern buildings. Ceramic slates for roofing can be made by industry, and have replaced natural slates in modern housing. Thatched rooves were once a source of fires, but slates are fireproof. That explains the gradual decline in thatched rooves.

KHD was a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had bought parts of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.
In March 1991, AGCO bought the Hesston Corporation.&lt;ref name="AGCO-Jul-1996-S-4/A"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, they gained hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost. Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO bought the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company. In 1993, AGCO bought the rest of White-New Idea, gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a big manufacturing plant in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.
In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers. 
In 2017, AGCO acquired Precision Planting, LLC, a planting equipment and technology business.

The 1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game was a college football game between the Central Missouri State Mules and the Southwestern Moundbuilders. It was played on September 14, 1951. The game was played at Sonner Stadium in Winfield, Kansas. The game is known for a team rejecting a touchdown awarded by the game officials.
Central Missouri's head coach Tate C. Page called it "the finest act of sportsmanship" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signaled a touchdown. The crowd of 2,000 cheered.
Southwestern's head coach Harold Hunt ran out on the field to shout, "Southwestern rejects the touchdown!" He then told the officials that Johnson had stepped out of bounds. This would undo the touchdown. None of the referees had seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the place where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed Coach Hunt was correct. It was published in the Winfield Daily Courier.
Referee W. P. Astle noted that there had been only three officials at the game instead of the regulation four. He later said, "If the fourth official had been present to cover what was impossible for me to cover ... I would never have discovered the ‘biggest’ man I ever met."
Southwestern's Coach Hunt was nominated for "Football's Man of the Year" by This Week magazine. This was because he showed so much sportsmanship.

The 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game was a college football game between Fairmount College (now called Wichita State University) and the Washburn Ichabods. It was played on December 25, 1905, in Wichita, Kansas. It was the first experiment with the forward pass. It was also the first experiment with the ten-yard requirement for first downs. It is unclear if the game was considered "regular season", "post season", or "exhibition" in classification.
Game play.
Fairmount college was coached by Willis Bates. The head coach for Washburn that season was John H. Outland. However, since he was officiating, it is likely that the coaching job was given to assistant coach (and next year's head coach) Garfield Weede. The game ended in a 0–0 tie.
The weather for the game were good, but neither side was able to get close to the other team's goal except by a punt. Only seven first downs were made the entire game—four by Washburn and three by Fairmount. Most of the game was played in the middle of the field. The fans were upset.
New rule test.
Safer but not "conducive".
Both teams had played a previous game that same season. What made this second game different was that it was a test of a different way to play. During the game, each team's offense was required to gain ten yards in three downs instead of four to earn a new first down.
The experiment was considered a failure. Football legend John H. Outland officiated the game and said, "It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes." The "Los Angeles Times" said that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not "conducive to the sport."
Impact.
Three days later, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of that meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created. Several other rule changes were made to make the game safer for players, including the addition of the forward pass.
First forward pass.
In his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson said that "the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas." Nelson says that Washburn did three passes, and Fairmount did two. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who did a pass to Art Solter.

= = = AGA cooker = = =
The AGA cooker is a heat storage stove and cooker. The heavy frame is made of cast iron and absorbs heat from a low-intensity source. Originally, AGAs burnt coke or anthracite. Later versions used gas as the heat source.
The heat is used for cooking. It was invented and initially produced in Sweden. From 1957 all production has been in the United Kingdom.
The cast-iron parts were cast at the Coalbrookdale foundry in the 1940s. They were still made there by the Aga Rangemaster Group until November 2017 when the company closed the site.
Owners often talk about how the AGA actually makes their homes more energy efficient. The AGA does a number of jobs: it replaces several radiators, a tumble dryer, electric kettle and toaster. It is not just a cooker.
The company which makes AGAs also makes other stoves, such as the Rayburn range. It is the Aga Rangemaster Group, which was taken over by the US company Middleton Corporation in 2015.

It was the most progressive of the four proposed constitutions. Important parts of this Constitution were a Bill of Rights that referred to ""all men" (making no distinction between the rights of white men and black men), making slavery in the state illegal, and a basic framework for the rights of women.
The constitutional convention that wrote the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February 1858, while the Lecompton Constitution was being debated in Congress. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858. It was also chosen by the people at an election on May 18, 1858.
The Leavenworth Constitution did not have a big impact on the history of Kansas since the US Senate did not approve of the laws in the document. The other proposed state constitutions were the Topeka Constitution (1855), the Lecompton Constitution (1857) and the Wyandotte Constitution (1859).

= = = Baseball color line = = =
The color line, also known as the color barrier, in American baseball stopped players of black African descent from playing Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen's agreement. This means an understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. There was minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league. It sent a powerful message that eventually led to blacks not being allowed to play at all.
African Americans created the Negro leagues starting in 1887. In these leagues, African American baseball teams played against each other. 
The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season.
Origins.
The beginning of segregation followed the baseball season of 1867. On October 16, the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball in Harrisburg denied admission to the "colored" Pythian Baseball Club.

= = = Barn raising = = =
A barn raising, also historically called a raising bee or rearing in the U.K., is a collective action of a community, in which a barn for one of the members is built or rebuilt by members of the community. Barn raising was common in 18th- and 19th-century rural North America. A barn was a necessary building for any farmer. Yet a barn was also a big and expensive building. Building a farm needed many people than a typical family could provide. Barn raising addressed the need by getting members of the community, unpaid, to help in the building of their neighbors' barns. Because each member was entitled to recruit others for help, the favor would eventually return to each participant.
One or more people with experience or with specific skills are chosen to lead the project. Young people helping for the first time have watched many barn raisings and know what is expected of them.

= = = County seat war = = =
A county seat war is an American phenomenon that happened mostly in the Old West as it was being settled. Although, there were similar events elsewhere, such as in southeastern Ohio. As new towns were created and county lines were drawn, there was intense competition for the status and tax benefits received by becoming a county seat. These "wars" often involved nothing more than lining up at the ballot box. However, sometimes people from a particular town would use voter fraud, intimidation or violence. 

= = = Transcontinental railroad = = =
A transcontinental railroad is a network of railroad trackage that crosses a continental land mass. It must be continuous. It has terminals at different oceans or continental borders. Such networks can be via the tracks of either a single railroad, or over those owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route.

= = = Pacific Railroad Acts = = =
The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 were a series of acts of Congress that supported the construction of a "transcontinental railroad" (the Pacific Railroad) in the United States. This happened through authorizing issuing government bonds and the grants of land to railroad companies. The War Department under then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was authorized by the Congress in 1853 to do surveys of five different potential transcontinental routes from the Mississippi. These surveys ranging from north to south and submitted a massive twelve volume report to Congress with the results in early 1855. However, no route or bill could be agreed upon and passed authorizing the Government's financial support and land grants. This change when the secession of the southern states in 1861 ended their opposition to a central route. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 () was the original act. Some of its provisions were changed, expanded, or repealed by four more amending Acts: The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1865 (), and Pacific Railroad Act of 1866 ().
The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 started federal government land grants directly to corporations; before that act, the land grants were made to the states, for the benefit of corporations.

= = = Pee Wee Gaskins = = =
Donald Henry "Pee Wee" Gaskins Jr. (March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American serial killer. He was executed by electrocution by South Carolina in 1991.
Gaskins was born in South Carolina, the last in a string of illegitimate children. Due to his smallness, he was nicknamed "Pee Wee". His youth was characterized by considerable neglect; for instance, when he was one year old, he drank a bottle of kerosene. He grew to 5 foot 2 inch and 130 pounds.
Gaskins' serial crime began before the concept was even realized, as a juvenile, which included along with a group of other youths: robberies, assaults and a gang rape. In prison, he was regularly raped. He escaped from prison in 1955 by sitting in the back of a garbage truck and fled to Florida; he was re-arrested, remanded and paroled in August 1961.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gaskins murdered several teenaged girls and young women. He was later found guilty of eight counts of murder and sentenced to death by South Carolina. While on death row, Gaskins murdered a fellow death row inmate, earning him the title "Meanest Man in America". Gaskins was put to death in the electric chair by South Carolina on September 6, 1991.

= = = Fuzhou dialect = = =
The Fuzhou dialect (, FR: ), also Foochow, Hokchew, Hok-chiu, or Fuzhounese, is the prestige variety of the Eastern Min branch of Min Chinese spoken mainly in the Mindong region of Eastern Fujian Province.
Fuzhou dialect history.
Fuzhou dialect is also a dialect of Mindong. Unlike Minnan dialect, Fuzhou dialects say that there are fewer people. This is mainly because the social development model of Fuzhou and Minnan is different. Therefore, the two languages spread differently. The eastern part of the country is dominated by agriculture, while southern Fujian has a large number of fisheries.
Fuzhou dialect is popular in the seven counties of Fuzhou in the eastern part of Fujian, Ningde City and Nanping City, as well as Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore. In addition, Fuzhou dialect is also popular in many Chinese communities in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.
Fuzhou dialect is derived from ancient Chinese and medieval Chinese. Due to the large-scale immigration of Han, Jin and Tang Dynasty, these ancient languages merged into the current Fuzhou dialect. Fuzhou dialect has experienced slow and obvious changes in pronunciation and vocabulary in the last 200 years.
In ancient times, Yue people lived along the banks of the Li River. Since the kingdom of Chu destroyed the country, the descendants of the king led some of the subjects to migrate to Fujian and merged with the Yue people into the Yue ethnic group. In 110 BC, the Yue dynasty against Han and was settled by Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty, after which most of the Yue people were moved to the Jianghuai area. During the Western Han Dynasty, the Central Plains Han people entered the shackles for the first time, and merged with the Yue and Yue people. Fuzhou dialect was integrated into the Central Plains dialect.
During the Jin Dynasty, the Central Plains people entered the country for the second time. The Han people and the Yue people further merged. The Han people became the main residents of Fuzhou, and the Central Plains dialect was once again integrated into the Fuzhou dialect.
At the end of the Tang Dynasty, the Han people of the Central Plains entered the country for the third time. Wang tried to establish the Shu Kingdom and strengthened the integration of the Central Plains dialect and the Gan dialect. Fuzhou dialect was basically formed in the Tang Dynasty and is gradually developing.
The Mandarin language movement in recent decades has led to fewer and fewer people in Fuzhou. Recently, the government and civil society have realized this problem and have taken many measures to promote it. According to statistics, half of Fuzhou young people now speak Fuzhou dialect.
The first book on the pronunciation of Fuzhou is the 'Yulin Sounds', which was published in the 17th century and provides a standard for Fuzhou dialect.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, Western scholars studied Fuzhou dialect, compiled a dictionary, and translated the Bible into Fuzhou dialect. Japanese scholars published a series of books on Fuzhou dialect in the 1940s. The efforts of Western scholars have developed the use of the Latin alphabet to write Fuzhou dialect, which was standardized in 1890. This set of standards is mainly used in churches.

On October 16, 1933 in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. All died from blows to the head. The killings, which were reported by the media as the work of an "axe-murdering marijuana addict", were used as prima facie evidence that there was a link between recreational drugs, such as cannabis, and crime. This led to the killings being used in 1930s anti-drug campaigns against marijuana. At trial, Licata was found criminally insane and committed to an insane asylum, where he later hanged himself in 1950.

= = = Marsha P. Johnson = = =
Marsha P. Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an American gay and transgender rights activist. They are best known for participating in the Stonewall riots in 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the advocacy group S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), alongside their friend Sylvia Rivera. From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.
Early life.
Johnson was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on August 24, 1945. They were one of seven children. Their father, Malcolm Michaels Sr, worked for General Motors. Their mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. Johnson attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church as a child. Johnson was very religious. They were very interested in Catholicism, and kept a private altar at home. Johnson began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped due to bullying from boys in their neighborhood. Johnson did not come to terms with being gay until the age of 17. Their mother was reportedly very homophobic, but Johnson has said that their mother was unaware of the LGBT community. After graduating from high school, Johnson moved to Greenwich Village, New York on their own. They supported themself by waiting tables. After meeting other gay people in the city, Johnson gained the confidence to come out themself.
Working as a performer.
Johnson began working as a drag queen after coming out as gay. They chose the drag name "Marsha P. Johnson". "Johnson" comes from the restaurant Howard Johnson's. They said that the "P" stood for "pay it no mind," a phrase they would use when people asked their gender. Johnson referred to themself as gay, a transvestite, and a drag queen interchangeably and preferred "they," rather than "she," to be used as a pronoun. Although they never referred to themself as being transgender, many modern scholars believe that was only because the term still was rarely used during their lifetime.
Johnson said that their style of drag was not serious because they could not afford expensive clothes. They made flower crowns out of leftover flowers from the Flower District of Manhattan, which they began well known for wearing. Johnson was tall, thin and wore long flowing clothes, red high heels and bright wigs. This tended to draw a lot of attention. Their style was often described as being masculine and feminine at the same time.
In 1972, Johnson became a member of the New York-based drag performance troupe Hot Peaches. Johnson also performed with the troupe The Angels of Light. In 1975, Johnson was photographed by famous artist Andy Warhol, as part of a series called "Ladies and Gentlemen".
Stonewall riots and activism.
The Stonewall riots were a series of riots in New York City in 1969. They happened after the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. Johnson is often said to have been one of the first people to begin rioting against the police, some going as far to say they "threw the first brick at Stonewall". Johnson denied this, but they did become heavily involved in gay rights activism after the police raid.
After the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front, which worked to fight against homophobia. They participated in a rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots in 1970. Also in 1970, Johnson and their fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at New York University after the university staff canceled a dance when they learned it was sponsored by gay organizations. 
Johnson and their close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization. STAR advocated for transgender rights and also provided shelter for gay and transgender youth in the "STAR House", which also provided shelter for sex workers. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for homeless gay and transgender youth.
The two were banned from participating in the gay pride parade in 1973 when the staff running the event stated they were not going to allow drag queens at marches because they were "giving them a bad name". Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade. They believed it was their right to participate in pride alongside other members of the LGBT community.
Mental health and death.
When they first came to New York City, Johnson became a sex worker to make money. They were arrested many times due to laws against prostitution. 
Johnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970. They would purposefully get themself arrested so that they would be given antipsychotic medication.
Though remembered by most as a kind and generous person, they were known to have occasional bouts of anger and aggression. It is believed that they may have suffered from a mental illness which caused mood swings.
Johnson was found dead shortly after the 1992 pride parade. Their body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. According to their friend, Randy Wicker, a witness saw Johnson fighting a man who later bragged about killing a drag queen named "Marsha". No arrests were made following this. Many locals believed that the law enforcement was unwilling to investigate Johnson's death because of their status as a drag queen and a sex worker.
Johnson was cremated and their ashes were released over the Hudson River by her friends following a funeral at the local church.
In November 2012, activist Mariah Lopez was able to get the New York police department to reopen the case as a possible homicide.
Tributes and legacy.
Johnson is remembered by many as an important figure in the fight for gay liberation.
The 2012 documentary "Pay It No Mind – The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson" features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, which was filmed shortly before their death. Many of their friends from Greenwich Village are interviewed for the documentary.
In 2018 the "New York Times" published a belated obituary for them.
On May 30, 2019, it was announced that Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be honored with monuments at Greenwich Village, near the site of the Stonewall club.
In June 2019, Johnson was one of fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn.

= = = Yuriy Meshkov = = =
Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov (, ("Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov"); October 25, 1945 – September 29, 2019) was a Crimean politician. He was a leader of the pro-Russian movement in Crimea. Meshkov was the only President of Crimea from 1994 to 1995.
Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in Synelnykove, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine (now Ukraine) of a mother of Ukrainian origin and a Russian father of Kossan Cossacks. He grew up in Simferopol, where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old, the Crimea region was officially transferred from the Russian RSFS to the Ukrainian SSR. For his military duties, he served in the Border Guard. In 1967 (in some sources in 1977), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Moscow State University. Until 1982, he worked as a detective and then as chief inspector in the district attorney's office. From 1982 to 1985, he spent time on the Skif scientific research yacht. After 1985 and until 1990, he worked privately as a legal consultant. At that time, he was also one of the heads of the "Memorial" department of the Crimean Illuminating Society "All-Union" and president of the Crimean kick-boxing Federation.
In 1990, Meshkov was elected deputy to the Supreme Council of Crimea (the parliament of the republic). There, he became the co-founder of the RDK (Republican Crimean Movement) party. In 1994, he headed the electoral block "Russia" for the Republican presidential elections, where he easily defeated Mykola Bahrov in the second round. Mykola Bahrov was at that time head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. In the second round of the presidential elections in Crimea in 1994, Meshkov won 72.9% and was elected only president of the republic.
Its main political program was to facilitate much closer relations with the Russian Federation until the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Mechkov tried to initiate a political-military union with Russia and completely ignored the positions of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian currency, issue Russian passports to the population of Crimea and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unexpected resistance of the local opposition, Meshkov only managed to place his autonomous republic in the Moscow time zone.

Her father was a leading 'Southern Democrat', and in the 1930s became Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. She was a childhood friend of Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Tallula was an actress from the beginning to the end of her life. She acted in nearly 300 film, stage, television, and radio roles. Her personal life was wild. She struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. She was infamous for her sex life, which included both men and women.

In her 1932 movie "Devil and the Deep" there were three major co-stars, with Tallulah getting top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant. David O. Selznick, producer of "Gone with the Wind" (1939) called her the "first choice among established stars" to play Scarlett O'Hara.

Although her screen test for the role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor.

History.
In Roman times, the place of the glove was taken by long sleeves (manicae) reaching to the hand, and in winter special sleeves of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae, defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae ("leather winter gloves"). He quotes from a cartulary of the year 817, of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been, as the Roman certainly were, separate coverings for each hand, although the cartulary referred to also tells apart the glove for summer from the muffulae for winter wear. The Old French moufle meant a thick glove or mitten, and from this the Dutch mof, Walloon mouffe, and from that time, English "muff", are probably made from.

= = = Armando Villanueva = = =
Armando Villanueva Del Campo (25 November 1915 – 14 April 2013) was a Peruvian politician. He was the leader of the Peruvian American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. Villanueva was born in Lima. He was the Prime Minister of Peru from 17 May 1988 through 15 May 1989 during Alan García's first presidency. 
Political career.
At the age of 15 Villanueva became a member of APRA's "Juventud Aprista Peruana" in opposition to the military dictatorship of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. At the age of 18 he was imprisoned in El Frontón prison (located on the small island of "San Lorenzo" off the coast of Callao, Lima's main port) for his subversive activities in Peru. He was a political ally and personal friend of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the founder and most prominent leader of the APRA party.
Villanueva spent most of his early life in different prisons for his political activities. In 1940, along with other APRA political activists, Villanueva was exiled to Chile. Between the 1940s and 1960s Villanueva spent his time in between Peruvian prisons and deportations to Chile and Argentina. While living in Santiago he met and married Lucia Ortega. They had a daughter: Lucia del Pilar Villanueva Ortega. 
In late 1961, before a general amnesty was granted to members of APRA, Villanueva entered Peru secretly. He needed to start organizing the multiple party cells in preparation for their return to full political activities. Afraid that he would be caught, he sought refuge at his cousin's house in San Isidro. Ana Maria Villanueva de Riva-Vercellotti was married to an Italian, and Armando was convinced that Peru's secret police would never find him there. He was able to stay there, unperturbed, till full amnesty was granted.
From 1963 to 1968 Villanueva served as a deputy in the lower house of the Peruvian legislature representing Lima, serving as President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1967 to 1968. Villanueva led the Aprista opposition to the military government of Juan Velasco.
The death of Haya de la Torre in 1979 propelled Villanueva to the leadership of the APRA party. As leader of the party Villanueva ran for the presidency in 1980 resulting in a second-place loss to the "Popular Action" party candidate Fernando Belaúnde. It is said that he lost the elections because the opposition mounted a negative campaign against him, claiming that he was married to a Chilean-born citizen. Chile's victory in the "Guerra del Pacifico" in 1883, which resulted in Peru losing a large chunk of its southern border to Chile, is still a subject of bad feeling in Peru.
In 1985 Villanueva was elected to the Peruvian Senate and elected as the President of the Senate from July 1986 to July 1987. During the presidency of Alan García, he served as prime minister from 1988 to 1989. In 1990, Villanueva was elected to his last term in the Senate, from 1990 to 1992 when Alberto Fujimori shut down Congress.
Last years.
Villanueva retired in 2005, at the age of 90, to dedicate the rest of his life to his family and writing. In May 2005, with the death of his cousin Ana Maria, he also assumed the title of family patriarch. Villanueva died of a heart attack in Lima on 14 April 2013 at the age of 97.

= = = Safety razor = = =
A safety razor is a shaving implement with a protective device put between the edge of the blade and the skin. The reason for the protective devices was to make it easier for people to shave without getting hurt. This made professional barbers less needed. The term was first used in a patent issued in 1880.
Plastic disposable razors and razors with replaceable blade attachments are in common use today. Razors commonly include one to five cutting edges, which are sharp.
Design.
Safety razors first had an edge protected by a comb patterned on different types of protective guards that had been placed to open-blade straight razors during the preceding decades.
Lifespan.
To maintain the sharpness, razors can be stropped using an old strip of denim.
Safety razors are usually made of razor steel. That is a low chromium stainless steel, and it can be made very sharp. However, it corrodes easily. Drying the blades after using them can make them last longer. Salt from human skin also can corrode the blades, but washing and carefully drying them can make them last longer.

= = = Disposable product = = =
A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed to be used only once, and then it would be recycled or is thrown away as solid waste. The word often implies cheapness and short-term convenience instead of something that will last for a long time. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar things that last forever (e.g. washable air filters).
Word meaning.
"Disposable" is an "adjective" meaning "something not reuseable but is disposed of after use". Many people now use the word as a noun or substantive (i.e. "a disposable") but it is still an adjective. This is because the "noun" (product, nappy, etc.) is implied.

= = = Disposable and discretionary income = = =
Disposable income is the income someone has after they have paid their taxes. Mathematically, it is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In national accounts definitions, personal income minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income.

= = = Autonomous consumption = = =
Autonomous consumption (also exogenous consumption) is when people are paying for things when they have no income. In other words, it is the consumption expenditure that happens when income levels are zero. Such consumption is considered autonomous of income only when spending on these consumables does not change much income is changed; generally, it may be needed to pay for things that are needed and pay off debt. If income levels are actually zero, this consumption is called dissaving. This is because it is paid for by borrowing or using up savings. Autonomous consumption is different from induced consumption because it does not consistently change with income, whereas induced consumption does. The two are related, for all households, through the consumption function:
where

= = = Consumption function = = =
In economics, the consumption function shows a relationship between consumption and disposable income. It is believed that John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea in macroeconomics in 1936. He used it to develop the idea of a government spending multiplier. 
Details.
Its simplest form is the "linear consumption function". It is used often in simple Keynesian models:
where formula_2 is the autonomous consumption that is independent of disposable income; in other words, consumption when there is no income. The term formula_3 is the induced consumption that is influenced by the economy's income level. It is generally assumed that there is no correlation or dependence between formula_4 and "C".

= = = Induced consumption = = =
Induced consumption is the part of consumption that changes with disposable income. It is when there is a change in disposable income “induces” (persuades or makes someone want to do something) a change in consumption on goods and services. In contrast, spending for autonomous consumption do not change with income. For example, spending on a consumable that is considered a normal good would be considered to be induced.
In the simple linear consumption function,
formula_1
induced consumption is represented by the term formula_2, where formula_3 shows disposable income. formula_4 is called the marginal propensity to consume.

= = = Ferrodraco = = =
Ferrodraco lentoni, "Lenton's Iron Dragon", is a species of pterosaur. The only known fossil of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of Winton, Queensland, Australia. 
The pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. The name, "Ferrodraco lentoni", comes from the Latin word, "ferrum" (iron), for the ironstone in which the fossil was found, and "draco", the Latin word for dragon. The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. 
Only small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. "Ferrodraco" is the most complete specimen found. Scientists have been able to identify five vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. That is in the Upper Cretaceous. 
The fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. 
Winton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here.

= = = Marginal propensity to consume = = =
In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a measurement that can put induced consumption into numbers. Induced consumption is the idea that an increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) happens with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which people spend on consumption is called the propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of more income that a person spends. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents of that dollar. Obviously, the household cannot spend "more" than the extra dollar (without borrowing).
John Maynard Keynes says that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.
The MPC is higher for poorer people than in rich.
Background.
Mathematically, the formula_1 function is written as the derivative of the consumption function formula_2 with respect to disposable income formula_3, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the formula_2-formula_3 curve.
or, approximately,
Marginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or formula_10. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:
Here formula_11; formula_12
Therefore, formula_13 or 83%.
For example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You now have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on something, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (formula_14).

= = = Consumer spending = = =
Consumer spending, consumption, or consumption expenditure is when people buy goods and services. It is the biggest part of aggregate demand in macroeconomics. There are two parts of consumer spending: induced consumption (which is changed by the level of income) and autonomous consumption (which is not).

Douglas’s health plan was copied by other provinces and spread to all of Canada. Douglas also created a Socialist political party called the New Democratic Party or NDP. 
Douglas is generally very respected because he created Canada’s universal healthcare system but recently some people have suggested that he should not be that praised because in the 1930’s he was a supporter of eugenics.

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, formerly known as the Old Executive Office Building, and the State, War, and Navy Building, is a U.S. government building situated just west of the White House in the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C.
The building was commissioned by President Ulysses S. Grant. It was built between 1871 and 1888, on the site of the original 1800 War/State/Navy Building and the White House stables. It is built in the French Second Empire style which caused a lot of criticism at the time. It did not fit in with other government buildings in the city which were designed in the neoclassical style. Mark Twain said it was "the ugliest building in America." President Harry S. Truman called it "the greatest monstrosity in America." Historian Henry Adams called it Mullett's “architectural infant asylum.”
It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark. 
It was for years the world's largest office building, with 566 rooms and about ten acres of floor space. In 1981, work began to restore the building. The main office of the Secretary of the Navy was restored in 1987 and is now used as the ceremonial office of the Vice President of the United States. Many White House employees have their offices in the EEOB.

In December 2022, with 9.56 million active lines, it is the fourth mobile operator in Italy following Wind Tre, TIM and Vodafone Italy.
History.
Iliad Italia was founded in 2016 as an Italian subsidiary of the French group Iliad SA. In 2017, in view of the launch and in compliance with the provisions of the European Commission, the acquisition of the frequencies ceased by Wind Tre began following the merger of Wind and 3 Italy; as of 31 December 2017, Iliad has acquired almost 300 of the sites abandoned by Wind Tre, while the remaining will be transferred, according to the agreements, by the end of 2019.
The French holding said it would invest more than €1 billion for the launch and development of the new Italian mobile operator (including those to win the new 5G frequencies in Italy) and also expected about a thousand hires.
On 16 January 2018 the name of the Italian administrator of Iliad Italia, Benedetto Levi, was officially announced, together with the presentation of the new logo and the institutional website. As part of the implementation of the infrastructures required to cover the Italian territory with its own network, on 16 February 2018, an agreement was reached with the Spanish group Cellnex, which provides Iliad Italia with over 7700 cellular antennas in Italy. Finally, on 29 May 2018, the official launch of the operator takes place, in conjunction with the presentation of the commercial offer and the start of the sale of SIM cards with new numbers or to carry out the number portability from other phone operators. On 18 July 2018, just under two months after its launch, Iliad Italia officially announced that it had reached one million customers between requests for portability and new subscriptions. On 4 September 2018, the Iliad group releases the results of the first half of 2018, reporting the achievement – by early August – of one and a half million customers in Italy; actually, on 6 September 2018, Iliad Italia issues a press release confirming the achievement of two million customers.

Their main enemies are said to be the gamekeepers on highland estates. In the United Kingdom, pine martens and their dens have protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

= = = Geometer moth = = =
Geometer moths are a large family of moths in the Lepidoptera. Over 23,000 species have been described. Most of them are nocturnal: only a few are active during the day. 
The imagos (adults) have wingspans between and . Their caterpillars move in a special way, they seem to "measure the earth". For this reason, the caterpillars are sometimes called inchworms. 
A well-known species is the peppered moth ("Biston betularia"). Many species are classified as pests.
Adults.
Many geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. They look a bit like butterflies, but in most respects they are typical moths. Most fly at night. They have a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They blend into the background with camouflage. In some species, females have reduced wings.
Caterpillars.
Most caterpillars have four pairs of feet in their central section but geometer moth caterpillars only have two. This means that they are unable to move like the other caterpillars. They use the front pair of feet to hold on to a support, and then they pull the rest of their body up close. Next, they use the pairs of feet in the back part of their body to hold on, and push the front part forward. This means they are often in a position which looks like the Greek letter Omega, as can be seen in the photo. 

= = = Key derivation function = = =
In cryptography, a key derivation function (KDF) makes a long secret key (which is called a "hash") from a secret phrase, like a password. The output of a key derivation function will look common to another result made from a random phrase. They are also used to re-use secret keys in a specific format, like using a shared secret key from the Diffie–Hellman key exchange for sending secrets in AES.
Use.
Key derivation functions are important in security. They allow a smaller "secret phrase" to be expanded into a larger key (of a fixed length decided by the KDF's digest size). This makes trying to find the original "secret phrase" more difficult. The length of the key makes it more difficult to discover the phrase or the hidden secret by trial and error (i.e. through brute-forcing), by making it difficult for a computer to guess. Sometimes, a small piece of random data (called a "salt") is added to the secret phrase before it is used with a KDF to make it more difficult guess the original "secret phrase" with a list of known "hashes".
It makes checking passwords safer without using the real password. Instead of keeping the real password, a "hash" of the key is kept and when checking the password, the "hash" of the real password is checked with the input. Some software put a limit on the length of a password and is sometimes used to make larger secret phrases smaller. KDFs are also made in a way so that, it takes a computer some effort to make the "hash". This makes making a list of potential combinations difficult.

= = = Northern goshawk = = =
The northern goshawk ("Accipiter gentilis") is a medium-large raptor in the family Accipitridae. 
There are other species in this genus, but this bird is spoken of as "the" goshawk because it has a wide range over most of Europe, Eurasia and North America. Probably only the golden eagle has a wider range.
The goshawk is a "true hawk", and its scientific name in Latin is "Accipiter", which means "hawk". 
In the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry.
It is mainly a resident bird, but those from colder regions migrate south for the winter. In North America, migratory goshawks are often seen migrating south along mountain ridge tops at nearly any time of the fall, depending on latitude.

= = = COX-2 inhibitors = = =
COX-2 inhibitors are a special type of analgesic. Cyclooxygenase (commonly abbreviated as COX) is an enzyme that has an important role in starting an inflammation and pain. There are many different types of COX; the most common are known as COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs work by blocking COX. The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1.. Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke. Several COX-2 inhibitors have been taken off the market, because of these side-effects. 
Other than as an analgesic, COX-2 inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of cancer, and of some neurological conditions, such as depression, and schizophrenia.
Because of the severe side-effects, COX-2 inhibitors are usually only available with a prescription.

His artillery was led by Ustad Ali and Mustafa. It marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gun powder firearms and field artillery.
The Mughal forces of Babur, the Timurid ruler of Kabulistan, defeated the much larger ruling army of Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi. The battle was fought on 21 April near the small village of Panipat, in the present day Indian state of Haryana, an area that has been the site of a number of decisive battles for the control of Northern India since the twelfth century.
The use of guns by troops of Babur helped them claim victory in the battle. The Lodi troops were lagging in terms of artillery skills and the sound emitted by canons frightened the war elephants of Lodi.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an international non-profit based in San Francisco, United States. It was started in July 1990 by John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor to promote Internet freedoms.
The EFF sponsors legal defense, defends individuals and new technology from unfair legal threats. It also monitors proposals that may weaken internet freedoms and liberties. It also monitors for possible weakening of fair use.
Activities.
Early Cases.
One of the first high profile cases of the EFF was "Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service." In early 1990, Steve Jackson Games was under a massive search and seizure operation. Copies of the game GURPS Cyberpunk was considered as proof by mistake. Emails were also modified and were a new technology at the time. It was not considered to be protected by the right to personal privacy at the time.
"Bernstein v. United States" was the second large case of the EFF. Programmer Daniel J. Bernstein had sued the US Government for permission to release his cryptographic software against limits put by the government.
DES Cracker.
During the mid-1990s, the United States Government did not allow for international use of any cryptographic product unless the ciphertext could be decrypted by a third-party with a promise that the government could not read messages protected by the Data Encryption Standard (DES) even after it was shown as weak and broken. The EFF had made a piece of hardware called the "EFF DES Cracker" that could crack a message within 24 hours.
The plans and source code were made public.

E. D. Hirsch is Eric Donald Hirsch Jr. (; born March 22, 1928. He is an American educator and academic literary critic. He is professor emeritus of education and humanities at the University of Virginia. 
In the 1960s Hirsch's "Validity in Interpretation" made an important work to contemporary literary theory and he was called "the founder of contemporary intentionalism". 
In popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation. 
He is a long-term critic of American schools, and promotes ideas for improving the education of children. His "The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them" (1996) was hated by the liberal left. It also managed to annoy the right wing because it attacked the local control of schools. in 2016 he published " Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories". This outlined three major problems with education in the United States. These are, according to him, the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is "appropriate" for their age.
Beginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the "Core Knowledge Grader Series" which the Foundation describes as "an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence". This series of books was received well by parents educating children at home, and it has been adopted by many school systems.
Sol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was "the most important education reformer of the past half-century."

= = = Estimator = = =
In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given amount based on observed data. The rule (the estimator), the amount that is being measured (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are different.
An estimator of a parameter formula_1 is often written as formula_2. If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the parameter, then the estimator is called unbiased. Otherwise, it is called biased.

= = = Statistical parameter = = =
A statistical parameter or population parameter is an amount put into the probability distribution of a statistic or a random variable. It can be thought of as a numbered amount of a trait of a statistical population or a statistical model.
A statistical parameter is different from its estimator in that the parameter is a fixed amount, while the value of an estimator changes according to some probability distribution. The notations formula_1 (for the parameter) and formula_2 (for the estimator) are often used to clarify this distinction.

= = = Efficiency (statistics) = = =
In the comparison of statistical procedures, efficiency is a measure of an estimator's quality. This would be about the estimator of an experimental design, or of a hypothesis testing procedure. Basically, a more efficient estimator, experiment, or test needs fewer observations than a less efficient one to get a given performance.

= = = Method of moments (statistics) = = =
In statistics, the method of moments is a method of estimation of population parameters.
Method.
Suppose that the problem is to estimate formula_1 unknown parameters formula_2 describing the distribution formula_3 of the random variable formula_4. Suppose the first formula_1 moments of the true distribution (the "population moments") can be expressed as functions of the formula_6s:
Suppose a sample of size formula_8 is drawn, and it leads to the values formula_9. For formula_10, let 
be the "j"-th sample moment, an estimate of formula_12. The method of moments estimator for formula_13 denoted by formula_14 is defined as the solution (if there is one) to the equations: 
Reasons to use it.
The method of moments is simple and gets consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions). However, these estimators are often biased.

He was a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at The University of Texas at Austin. He is known for his creation of the lithium-ion battery, which is used on cellphones such as iphones.
Career.
In 2014, he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize for his works to the lithium-ion battery. In 2019, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino. At age 97, he is the oldest person to win a Nobel prize. His other works also focus on the field of magnetism.
He was a Professor at The University of Texas at Austin. During his time there, he has worked on research on ionic conducting solids and electrochemical devices. He wanted to study to fix materials for batteries to help create electric vehicles and help end the use of fossil fuels. Goodenough discovered the polyanion class of cathodes. They showed that positive electrodes having polyanions, sulfates, create higher voltages than oxides because of the inductive effect of the polyanion.
In 2011, Goodenough was honored with the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama.

The protesters declared their plan to hold an indefinite general strike, which would last until the government overturned its decision. 
President Moreno declared a state of emergency on October 4, 2019, amid nationwide protests against a hike in fuel prices. The protests had weakened the country's transport network with all major roads and bridges blocked in the capital Quito.
Shortly thereafter, President Lenín Moreno refused to discuss a potential reversal of the fuel plans and called protesting crowds as "criminals".
On 8 October 2019, President Moreno said his government had relocated to the coastal city of Guayaquil after anti-government protesters had overrun the capital Quito.

= = = Ansible = = =
An ansible is a kind of fictional device or technology. Ansibles can communicate faster than light. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay, even between star systems. As a name for such a device, the word "ansible" first appeared in a 1966 novel "Rocannon's World" by Ursula K. Le Guin The word shortened from "answerable." It allowed users to receive answers to their messages quickly, even over interstellar distances. 
In Le Guin's works.
Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited bandwidth which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.
Other writers.
Many other writers have ansibles in their fiction. Examples include:

= = = Parks and Recreation = = =
Parks and Recreation is a television sitcom. It was on TV from April 9, 2009 to February 24, 2015, with a special reunion episode airing on April 30, 2020. During this time, it showed 126 episodes over seven seasons. It ran on the channel NBC. It was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show is about a group of people who live in a fictional town called Pawnee in the state of Indiana. They work in the government of Pawnee, in the Department of Parks and Recreation. The main character of the show is Leslie Knope. She is an optimistic person who loves her job and the city of Pawnee. The actress who plays her is Amy Poehler. There are many other characters in the show. They are: Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), Donna Meagle (Retta), and Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner).
The series changed as time went on. The writers wanted to make the show like real life. To do this, they learned about how governments of cities really worked. They also talked about current political issues in episodes of the show. For example, one episode has the government of Pawnee shut down. This means that there is not enough money for the government to work correctly, so it stops doing everything that is not very important. The writers put this in the show because of a real government shutdown. The real shutdown happened because of a financial crisis in 2007-2008, and this was the same time that the episode was being written. Sometimes, real politicians also acted on the show. Joe Biden, John McCain, and Michelle Obama were some of the politicians who did this. The characters in the show also changed. Some people watched the first season and thought that Leslie Knope was too ditzy—that is, unintelligent and unable to do her job correctly. So the writers changed the way they showed Leslie. They wanted viewers to know she really was smart. During the show, many of the characters have changing romantic relationships and get different jobs. They changed just like people change in real life.
The first season only had six episodes. It got mixed reviews. People thought some things about it were good, and some things about it were bad. Many people thought it was too much like "The Office." Like "Parks and Recreation, The Office" was another sitcom that Daniels created. But after the first season, it got positive reviews. Many people thought it was good, and it won many awards. It was nominated for an Emmy Award 14 times. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy. It won a Golden Globe Award for the good job Poehler 
did playing Leslie Knope.

The Drosophilidae is a huge, widespread (cosmopolitan) family of flies, which includes the famous fruit flies. The family has over 4000 species in 75 genera. A recent publication lists the species:
There is another unrelated family of flies, the Tephritidae, which includes species also known as "fruit flies".
The best known species of the Drosophilidae is "Drosophila melanogaster". This species and its relatives are often used for studies on genetics, development, physiology, and behaviour.
"D. melanogaster" is not so much studied in the field as in the laboratory. The best-known studies of "Drosophila" in a natural environment was done by Dobzhansky and colleagues on "Drosophila pseudoobscura" from the early 1930s to 1970. Reprints and discussions are in Lewontin "et al" 2003, and theoretical discussions in Dobzhansky, 1970.
The cells of fruit flies usually do not divide after the imago is hatched. The fruit fly is mostly composed of post-mitotic cells, has a very short lifespan, and shows gradual ageing. As in other species, temperature influences the life history of the animal. They live longer in colder weather. Several genes can be manipulated to extend the lifespan of these insects.
The Drosophilidae has two subfamilies, the Drosophilinae and the Steganinae.

= = = Drosophilinae = = =
The Drosophilinae are the largest subfamily in the Drosophilidae. The other subfamily is the Steganinae.
A huge amount of research has shown the way the fly has evolved many species as it spread across the world.
The genus "Drosophila" is paraphyletic because several genera (with many species), such as "Zaprionus", "Scaptomyza" and "Lordiphosa", are within the genus. What this means is that they have evolved from more standard "Drosophila" over time. This is pretty well supported by the evidence of their genome.
In taxonomy, there are two ways of solving this kind of problem:
Genus "Drosophila" could be raised to a supergenus, or the related offshoot genera could be demoted to subgenera.

Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane. Especially, in places where sugarcane is grown commercially, it is a popular drink.

In Portugese, it is called garapa. These names can also refer to palm syrup. 
In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers "evaporated cane juice" to be a misleading term for "sugar" on product labels. The FDA regards "juice" as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables, so the preferred term is "cane sugar".
In Brazil, laboratories use sugarcane juice to make ethanol fuel.

On 7 February 2006, Barrow told 7 News that he will resign if the UDP losses the upcoming Municipal elections. Contreras was at that time one of the two choices who would succeed Barrow as Leader of the UDP, if he were to resign then. The other choice was Shadow Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan. After the UDP won the 2006 municipal election, Barrow kept his promise and remained as UDP Leader.
Contreras is a former member of the Belize national football team. He first joined the team in 1993.

Contreras had the support of Prime minister, Manuel Esquivel and Former UDP Leader, Dean Lindo, while Valdez was backed by Deputy prime minister, Barrow and Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan (Belizean politician). In the end, Contreras won 1,537 votes to Valdez’s 1,527 votes. Contreras then prepared himself to face Amin Hegar of the People’s United Party (PUP) in the 1998 Belizean general election who had been the MP for Cayo West for over five years. Contreras had a disadvantage and new that the road to Cayo West was not easy. He was even criticised for “lack of experience”. When Esquivel called the election, Contreras led his People in a March from Cinderella Plaza through downtown Belize City to the Island. It was a very Successful March which energised his Party. After the March concluded, Lindo spoke to News 5 and said that he has full confidence that Contreras will win and deliver Cayo West for his People. Public support for Contreras indicated that he was going to win his Constituency with a Landslide victory. However that all changed on Election Day. It was found that Contreras had allegedly handed out leases to over four hundred lots on Election Day and this constituted Bribery under the Election laws. The written Opinion in the case has not yet been released. After a determined Campaign, Contreras emerged Victorious, gaining 1,537 votes to Hegar’s 1,527 votes retiring the one term MP. Bucking a National trend, Contreras as the Only UDP Candidate to defeat a PUP House Incumbent In 1998 and one of the only three UDP members elected nationwide that Year. After the UDP’s Landslide lost in the 1998 election, Esquivel resigned as UDP Leader and the Party had only three suitable candidates for the post. A The first being Front-runner, Barrow who was considered favourite in the race and the others being, Finnegan and Contreras.

Instead, they help experts at their organisation to write about the things they know. 
WiRs work with different types of organisations. These are most often GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). Some residents work in educational institutions such as universities. Sometimes they work across several organizations. If they do, then they can be called a "Wikimedian at Large". one worked across New Zealand. Some WiRs are paid by the organization where they work. Or they can be paid by a Wikimedia-related organization. Some are volunteers.

= = = English-speaking world = = =
Over two billion people speak English. It is the largest language by number of speakers. It is the fourth largest language by number of native speakers. English is the most widely spoken second language.
Overview.
The United States of America is the largest English-speaking country, with 300 million native speakers. There are 60 million native speakers in the United Kingdom, 29 million in Canada, 25.1 million in Australia, 4.7 million in the Republic of Ireland, and 4.9 million in New Zealand.
In the European Union, English is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions, and by almost all of the population as the native language in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is a second language in other member states.
Estimates that include second language speakers vary greatly, from 470 million to more than 2 billion. David Crystal calculates that, as of 2003, non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.p69 When combining native and non-native speakers, English is the most widely spoken language worldwide.
Besides the main dialects of English, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have millions of native speakers of dialect continua. These versions range from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries such as Ghana and Uganda also use English as their primary official languages.
India now claims to be the world's second-largest English-speaking country. The most reliable estimate is about 10% of its population or 125 million people, second only to the US. It may be four times larger in the next decade from 2012.
Countries by English-speaking percentage.

The Alpha Persei Cluster (also known as Melotte 20 or Collinder 39) is an open cluster in the constellation of Perseus. 
To the naked eye, the cluster has several blue spectral type B type stars. The most luminous member is the ~2nd magnitude white-yellow supergiant Mirfak, also known as Alpha Persei. Bright members also include Delta, Sigma, Psi, 29, 30, 34 and 48 Persei. The Hipparcos satellite and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting show the cluster as about ~172 parsecs away from us. 
Since the distance by the independent analyses agree, the cluster is an important rung on the cosmic distance ladder. The age of this cluster is about 5070 million years.

= = = Gould Belt = = =
The Gould Belt is a partial ring of stars local to us in the Milky Way. It is about 3000 light years across, tilted from the galactic plane by 16 to 20 degrees. It has many large and bright O- and B-type stars.
The belt may be the local spiral arm to which the Sun belongs. At present the Sun is about 325 light years from the arm's centre. The belt is thought to be from 30 to 50 million years old, and of unknown origin. Benjamin Gould identified it in 1879.
The belt contains bright stars in many constellations including (in order going more or less eastward) Cepheus, Lacerta, Perseus, Orion, Canis Major, Puppis, Vela, Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Centaurus, Lupus, and Scorpius (including the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). 
Overview.
Star-forming regions with bright O and B stars make up the Gould Belt. These regions include the Orion Nebula and the Orion molecular clouds, the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association, Cepheus OB2, Perseus OB2, and the Taurus-Auriga Molecular Clouds. 
A theory proposed around 2009 suggests that the Gould Belt formed about 30 million years ago when a blob of dark matter collided with the molecular cloud in our region. There is also evidence for similar Gould belts in other galaxies.

= = = Drosophila subobscura = = =
Drosophila subobscura is a species of fruit fly in the family Drosophilidae. 
It was originally found around the Mediterranean, but it has spread to most of Europe and the Near East. It has been introduced into the west coasts of Canada, the United States, and Chile.
 This species is in the "Sophophora" subgenus. 
Study organism for evolutionary biology.
In 1933, A.H. Sturtevant captured a species of Drosophila in England. It was a member of "Drosophila subobscura".
"D. subobscura", with others in its species group, is a model organism for evolutionary-biological studies. Its genetics and ecology have been studied for over fifty years.
They have served as favourable models ever since Dobzhansky and his colleagues published their influential works in the 1930s and 40s. 
Their use as a regular laboratory fly was promoted by J.B.S. Haldane and John Maynard Smith at University College London over a period of about 30 years. There it was used for research into population genetics, and for teaching genetics. For many years this species was the European "rival" to the "D. pseudoobscura" favoured by the group in California led by Dobzhansky.

= = = Serbo-Croatian = = =
Serbo-Croatian is the name of a South Slavic language, which is spoken in modern-day Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, it has been divided into four variants. The variants of this language are all based on a single dialect, Shtokavian. Speakers of these variants all understand each other.
History.
Between 1954 and 1992, it was one of the official languages of Yugoslavia (the others were Slovenian and Macedonian). The term Serbo-Croatian was first used in the 1830s. Today, people often speak about Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin languages. Research has also shown that what is called Serbo-Croatian language, is in fact a number of slightly different sub-dialects. People speaking one of the dialects easily understand other people speaking a different dialect. People in Croatia use the Latin alphabet to write the language, while people in other parts use both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

= = = David Hahn = = =
David Charles Hahn (October 30, 1976 – September 27, 2016) was an American who attempted to build a homemade neutron source at the age of 17. He is sometimes called the "Radioactive Boy Scout" or the "Nuclear Boy Scout".
He was a scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Hahn did his experiments without anyone knowing. He did them in a backyard shed at his mother's house in Commerce Township, Michigan. While he never actually was able to build a reactor (what he built was a neutron source), Hahn got the attention of local police when he was stopped for a different reason. The police found things in his vehicle that troubled them. He warned that it was radioactive. His mother's property was cleaned up by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ten months later as a Superfund cleanup site. Hahn attained Eagle Scout rank shortly after his lab was dismantled.
Background.
Hahn was born in Royal Oak, Michigan.
Creation of the neutron source.
Hahn was a Boy Scout. He was interested in chemistry. He spent years doing amateur chemistry experiments. Those experiments sometimes made small explosions. He was inspired by reading "The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments", and he tried to get samples of every element in the periodic table. This included the radioactive ones. He later received a merit badge in Atomic Energy. He became interested with the idea of building a breeder reactor in his home. Hahn got a lot of radioactive material by collecting small amounts from household products. It included things such as americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping lantern mantles, radium from clocks, and tritium from gunsights. His "reactor" was a bored-out block of lead, and he used lithium from $1,000 worth of bought batteries to purify the thorium ash using a Bunsen burner.
FBI Investigation.
On April 23, 2007, the FBI heard that Hahn may have a second breeder reactor in his freezer. The FBI contacted him via telephone. Hahn said that he did not have any radioactive material. The FBI decided he was not a terrorist threat. However, they decided to do a personal interview. During a May 16, 2007 interview at an FBI office, investigators asked Hahn about flyers that he had sent out promoting his book and upcoming film. They also asked about him stealing tires and rims from a vehicle before he joined Navy service. They also asked him about a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. FBI agents then interviewed a person (whose name was not given) who said that Hahn was using cocaine a lot. They also said he was not taking his prescribed medication, and that he was paranoid of people that he claimed "had the ability to 'shock' his genitals with their minds". They also said he had possibly been visited by prostitutes. The person also said that he believed that Hahn was still trying to build a reactor, and that Hahn was collecting radium. He said that he did not believe Hahn wanted to hurt anyone, but was worried for his mental health.
Larceny of smoke detectors.
In Clinton Township, Michigan on August 1, 2007, Hahn was charged with larceny for removing many smoke detectors from the halls of his apartment building. He wanted to get americium from them. In his mug shot, his face is covered with sores. Investigators believe those sores could be from being near radioactive things, psoriasis, or possible drug use.
Death.
Hahn died on September 27, 2016. He was 39 years old. Hahn died in his hometown of Shelby Charter Township, Michigan. His death was accidental and due to intoxication from the combined effects of alcohol, diphenhydramine, and fentanyl.

= = = Multiplayer online battle arena = = =
MOBA is an abbreviation for "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena". League of Legends is an example of a MOBA.
Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) is a subgenre of strategy video games that has gained immense popularity since the early 2000s. MOBAs are typically team-based games where players control a single character or unit and work together with their team to achieve a common goal.
Gameplay in MOBAs usually involves two opposing teams, each trying to destroy the other team's base while defending their own. Players must work together to defeat computer-controlled enemy units and gain experience and gold, which can be used to purchase upgrades and items for their characters.
One of the most popular MOBAs is League of Legends, which was released in 2009 and has since become one of the most played online games in the world. Other popular MOBAs include Dota 2, Smite, and Heroes of the Storm.
MOBAs require a combination of strategic thinking, quick reflexes, and teamwork to succeed. Players must communicate effectively with their teammates, manage resources, and make split-second decisions in order to gain an advantage over their opponents.
The rise of MOBAs has led to the development of professional esports leagues and tournaments, where teams of players compete for large cash prizes. The popularity of these events has helped to legitimize video gaming as a competitive sport and has brought gaming into the mainstream.
While MOBAs are known for their fast-paced, action-packed gameplay, they can also be complex and difficult to learn. Many MOBAs have extensive tutorials and learning resources to help new players get started, but it can take months or even years to become proficient at the game.
Despite the challenges, MOBAs remain one of the most popular genres in gaming, with millions of players around the world logging on to play each day. With new games and updates being released regularly, the MOBA genre shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

= = = Roman conquest of Britain = = =
The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius. His general Aulus Plautius became first Governor of Roman Britain (). 
Britain had been the target of invasions by the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. It had diplomatic and trading links with the Romans after Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC. Roman economic and cultural influence was already part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, in the south.
Between 55 BC and the 40s AD, Britain was not invaded. Augustus prepared invasions in 34 BC, 27 BC and 25 BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms. Strabo's "Geography", written during this period, says that Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered.
By the 40s AD, the political situation in Britain was apparently in some chaos. Caligula planned a campaign against the Britons in 40, but it never happened. Caligula's preparations made Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at (modern Boulogne-sur-Mer) that provided a model for the one built soon after at Dover.

= = = Interface = = =
An interface or shell is what the user uses on an operating system to make the computer do tasks, like writing a document, or loading a web page. There are two types of interfaces, a command line interface (CLI for short) - where people write commands to make the computer perform tasks, or a graphical user interface (GUI for short), where people use their Computer mouse to click on buttons to perform tasks.
Command line interface.
"See Command line interface."
Command line interfaces ask the user to type in commands in a text-based environment, not allowing images, like the screen image to the right.
For example, if the user wanted the computer to say "Hello World", he or she would:
This is hard to use for most people, mostly because when the user has to do a long command, he or she can miss a letter or two, so the computer shows an error, and he or she has to do it all over again, which can waste hours.
Graphical user interface.
"See Graphical user interface."
Graphical user interfaces are instead made of not only text, but also images. The first computer to do this was the Apple Lisa (1983).
The following operating systems can use graphical user interfaces:
Since the top operating systems (listed above) use graphical user interfaces, they are seen on every computer. Anyone can still use a command line interface on any computer very easily.

Pelagornis is a genus of huge fossil birds. One species, "P. sandersi", is one of the largest bird ever found. Its wingspan was twice that of the largest Albatross.

The pelagornithids are an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth-like beak projections, large size, and highly modified wing bones. There are many questions about their ecology. The bird was capable of highly efficient gliding. That suggests it had a long-range marine soaring life-style similar to that of living albatross.
Several later species have been found, and they are not quite so large. The whole group died out about three million years ago.

In temperate climates, this species has one or two broods depending on its location. In the Arctic, the warm period is so short that a woollybear feeds for several summers before it pupates. Each winter it freezes. A woollybear of another species lives through as many as 14 winters, before it pupates, and becomes an adult, having only a few-day mating period.

Elsa was born with magic powers. She freezes everything that she touches. When she can't control them, she shuts herself away from everyone.
About.

= = = Prosopagnosia = = =
Prosopagnosia, also called face blindness, is a condition where a person cannot recognize faces, "even their own". At first it was thought to be a condition caused by severe brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia). It may be caused by a head injury to the temporal lobe of the brain.
However, a congenital (inherited birth defect) or developmental form of the disorder does exist, with a prevalence rate of 2.5%. That is quite a high rate. What this defect shows is that our picture of the world is built up by various brain systems, and we do not notice how this is done. It seems seamless and automatic. Actually, there are many brain mechanisms which normally work together, tying the visual scene to memory so that we recall vital information. It is difficult to think of anything more vital than remembering who we know, and what their relationship is to us. 
"People with prosopagnosia never develop the ability to recognize faces". They may be able to rely on other physical features, such as the way someone walks and talks, their hair color, their height and build, etc. Prosopagnosia is not curable or treatable.
The opposite of prosopagnosia is the skill of superior face recognition ability. People with this ability are called "super recognizers".
Cause.
Prosopagnosia can be caused by lesions (damage or changes to body tissue) in the lower part of the brain. It can also be caused by damaging the nerves in the lower part of the brain, called 'acquired prosopagnosia'. It can be caused by birth defects, carbon monoxide poisoning, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease.
Doctors can check patients for prosopagnosia by using PET and fMRI scans to see if their brain reacts when they see faces.
An analysis of family inheritance (pedigree trees) suggest that a dominant gene mutation may be the root cause of the condition when it is present from birth. This mode of inheritance explains why HPA is so common among certain families.
An account of a woman who cannot recognise her own face is an example of prosopagnosia. Its special interest is that she can recognise all inanimate objects, and all animals except humans and chimpanzees!

= = = Xenohyla = = =
Xenohyla is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in deserts and other dry places in the middle of Brazil, not far from the Atlantic Ocean. "Xenohyla eugenioi" lives in the State of Bahia and the State of Sergipe, and "Xenohyla truncata" lives in the State of Rio de Janeiro. These frogs have strong bodies, wide flat heads, short faces, short front legs, and a body that looks short from above. They live near bromeliad plants, where they hide during the day. They eat the insects that also live in the plant. They lay eggs in temporary pools of water that are formed by rainwater. Both species are orange or brown with a white stripe down the edges of their backs. "X. truncata" loses this stripe when it becomes an adult but "X. eugenioi" keeps it as an adult.
"Xenohyla truncata" is the only known amphibian that eats fruit. It finds the fruit and swallows it whole. The seeds from the fruit come out of its body in its waste, which helps the plant spread. This frog also eats insects and other animals without bones. How much depends on the time of year. It eats more fruits when the plants grow fruit and more small animals when they do not. Scientists do not know whether or not "Xenohyla eugenioi" eats fruit too.
The genus name comes from Ancient Greek xeno (����� meaning "strange" or "alien") and hyla (��� meaning "wood" or "forest") which is used for tree frogs, so the genus name means "strange tree frog." "Xenohyla truncata" means "strange truncated tree frog" after the short shape of its body. "Xenohyla eugenioi" is named after Brazilian amphibian scientist Eugênio Izecksohn who wrote the first formal paper about the genus and type species. The name means "Eugênio's strange tree frog."
Species.
There are two species in this genus:

= = = St. Andrew's Cross = = =
The St. Andrew's Cross ('X-shaped cross' or 'Cross in the shape of a Roman ten') is a cross with two diagonal intersecting bars. It cross consists of slanting beams (also of different lengths), the term sloping cross is also used. There is this cross often at a level crossing.
The name refers to the apostle Andrew, who is said to have died as a martyr on such a cross, reports from the 4th century suggest. The diagonal cross has therefore become an attribute of this apostle and found expression in religion and especially in late medieval Christian iconography. Originally a symbol of the crossed sticks of the fire sacrificial altar, it can also be found in depictions of the sacrifice of Isaac. It also contains the Greek letter Chi (�) as a symbol for Christ, as in the Christ monogram. Especially in early Christian times, the St. Andrew's cross was often used for the name of Christ, e.g. B. was used as an identifier.
Symbolism.
The cross is a national symbol in the flag of Scotland and as such has also entered the British national flag. The flag of the Basque Country also has such an element.
Also, as a traditional Orthodox symbol, the St. Andrew's Cross has become part of the flag of the Russian Navy (naval warfare flag).
In heraldry, the St. Andrew's Cross is also called tray cross. The common figures arranged crosswise are then placed in tiers (also tiered) or diagonally crossed. The cross can also appear as a herald image in the coat of arms and follows the possible representation of crosses. An older heraldic expression is the shield ten, based on the Roman ten (X), which reflects the shape of the St. Andrew's Cross. In a narrower and smaller version, the herbalist uses the French term flan chis, as in the Amsterdam coat of arms.

= = = Sauro Pazzaglia = = =
Sauro Pazzaglia (26 May 1954 - 14 July 1981) is an Italian professional Grand Prix motorcycle road racer.
Death.
Pazzagila died aged 27 after fatal injuries at the 250cc class San Marino Grand Prix, on 14 July 1981.
The 1981 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 12-15 July 1981. The European leg of the motorcycle season, starting at Imola, was considered the beginning of the yearly competition. 
Crash.
As Pazzagila rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner during qualifying, his motorcycle left the racing line at around , ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around , after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag not allowed was shown as a consequence of the accident. 
Rescue.
Within two minutes of crashing, Pazzagila was extracted from his race motorcycles by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care member Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Pazzagila having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Pazzagila had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Pazzagila to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.
Hospital announcement.
At 21:20, the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandrimade the announcement that Pazzaglia had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:41, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning. Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Pazzaglia fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.
Comparison.
These crashes were the worst of several that took place that weekend and were the first fatal collisions to occur during a motorsports race event (and not repeated until the fatal crash of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Formula One).
Funeral.
Pazzaglia's death was considered by many of his Italian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Italian declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Cattolica, but the Pazzaglia's family wished that it return home in a Italian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Pazzaglia's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a Boeing 747 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into Cagliari Elmas Airport on 18 July 1981, where it was met by the Mayor of Cagliari, and the state's governor, Luiz Antônio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2 km) journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.

During World War II, the city was occupied by Axis troops from October 1941 to August 1943. In January 1989 the population was 25,706 people.
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trostianets — strategically located between the larger settlements of Sumy and Kharkiv — was attacked by Russian forces shortly after the invasion was launched on 24 February and was captured by them on 1 March 2022. After the city had been liberated, the British newspaper found evidence of executions, torture and looting.

A meme coin (also spelled memecoin) is a cryptocurrency that becomes an Internet meme or other joke. It may be used in the wade sense like a critique of the cryptocurrency market etc. This term is often used in a humorous tone. Compared to real cryptocurrencies, they are not significant. Supporters, on the other hand, say that some meme coins have reached high market capitalizations.
In late 2013, Dogecoin was created as a joke on the Doge meme by software engineers. This started the creation of several next meme coins. In October 2021, there were about 124 meme coins circulating in the market. Notable examples is Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. 
Some countries start to regulate meme coins. In early 2021, Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission banned meme coins as part of an end to digital goods with "no clear objective".
Meme coins became popular since Elon Musk validated the use of Dogecoin, one of the first meme coins. He continues to post tweets about Dogecoin in 2022.
Moreover there are meme tokens. Tokens differs from coins as the first ones does not have their own blockchain and work in blockchains of other coins (e.g. Shiba Inu).

Publishing mark is a trademark of a publishing house or printing house (private or public) specializing that creating books and periodicals. 
The first printer's mark is found in the 1457 Mainz Psalter by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer. The owner of a printing house in Venice chose a dolphin and an anchor as his publishing mark. The sign is based on the ancient paradox "Hurry slowly" (Latin Festina lente). The dolphin was a sign of speed, the anchor — stability. In addition, both symbols were on the image of port Venice, the capital of the Adriatic.
Previously, books had a material value. Protection was the sign of the ruler — a piece of paper with the name and surname of the ruler. The best artists of the day were involved in the creation of bookplates and trademarks. Only a limited number of collectors and bibliophiles knew the history of printing stamps.
Publishing stamps be close to bookplates, but they also have their own specifics. They have a different purpose. In bookplates — coats of arms, initials, images of architectural structures, individual sculptures that have long received the meaning of symbols, allegories and more

= = = Multiculturalism in the United Kingdom = = =
Multiculturalism is the presence of several distinct cultural or ethnic groups within a society. In the UK, this usually means people who are visibly different, because of the colour of their skin, their clothing, or their behaviour. 
Multiculturalism in the UK has its roots in the early seventeenth century. The UK had the biggest Empire in the history of the world - the British Empire. In the nineteenth century, it covered roughly 25% of the world's land surface and ruled around one-fifth of the entire population of the world. In the age of colonialism, the culture of all the colonies, like India, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, and many other countries collided together. From 1801-81, the United Kingdom saw many immigrants arrive on British shores due to a booming economy domestically. In this period, over 2,000,000 people from Ireland moved to Great Britain, and over 1,500,000 from Germany and other parts of Europe arrived as well.
Since the time of the British Empire, many people have moved to the UK. After World War II, the UK needed more people to fill labour shortages, so it motivated Commonwealth citizens to come to Britain; viewed by many as the "mother country". During the Great War, one quarter of a million Belgians came to Britain to escape the wrath of the war. During the 1930s before World War II, Jews started to migrate to the UK with the rise of Hitler and fascism across the continent. During the 1940s to 1960s, Polish people were invited to come and stay in the United Kingdom with the promise of jobs and a house. Due to the massive migration of Polish people since, the Polish community is deeply anchored in present society. From the 1950s to 1960s immigrants from Pakistan and India settled in the UK. The year 1972 saw a further increase in Asian arrivals in the United Kingdom, those who had been expelled by dictator Idi Amin of Uganda. Though the immigrants helped the UK by contribution to the workforce, racism was a big problem in British society.
Since 2016, immigration from outside Europe has increased considerably in the UK, as it has in most European countries. 
Most immigrants come and live in cities, where there are other people from their community. In the past they mostly settled in seaports. Immigrant communities in London, Liverpool and Glasgow are very old, and were started by sailors. Chinese people moved out of the cities and started laundries and restaurants, often in small country towns where they were the only immigrants. George Formby made several songs about "Mr. Wu", a Chinese laundry man in the 1930s.
In the 1960s, the UK made a change to immigration policy. The immigration policy of Britain became more about tolerating immigrants, but not actively caring about integration. In 1962, the Commonwealth Immigrants bill was passed to restrict immigration. There was quite a lot of discrimination against immigrants. The punk singer John Lydon, who was born in London in 1956, called his autobiography "No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs." His parents were poor Irish immigrants who settled in North London. People say these words were used by landlords then. That may not be true, but there were certainly signs saying “no West Indians”. As Lydon says, Irish people blend in better than the Jamaicans.
Enoch Powell, when he was Minister for Health, recruited nurses for the NHS from the Caribbean. Later, in 1968 he made a speech and said that if the United Kingdom let too many immigrants in, there would be bloodshed in the streets.
The Race Relations Act 1965 was the first law in the UK to say that discrimination on the "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" in public places in Great Britain was prohibited. It was followed by more, stronger, laws. 
Today, there is still a strong connection with many of the old colonies and most of them are still part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Due to this history, immigrants from all over the world come to the UK and bring with them their food, religion, and music; this forms the multicultural society of the UK. 
About 14.4% of the people in the United Kingdom in 2021 were born overseas. About 3,346,000 of them lived in London. 18% of people counted in the 2021 Census said they belonged to a Black, Asian, mixed or other ethnic group. In the Community Life Survey 2019/20 84% of these people said they felt strongly that they belonged to Britain. 
Although 'multiculturalism' initially seemed like a good idea on paper, it has proven difficult in practice given some new groups' desire for greater recognition and rights in recent years. The UK has increased its multicultural representation in recent years as well but is still struggling with issues related to 'multiculturalism'. Overall, it's important to understand and respect each cultural group without giving them preferential treatment- doing so can help create a more unified nation that is far richer from a cultural perspective.
The multicultural face of the UK.
The following table shows that the UK is home to numerous ethnic minorities. Most immigrants come from India, Poland, Pakistan, and Ireland. Around 90% of immigrants who entered the UK went to England. They settled in English cities, giving England the largest number of cultural districts. 
Language plays an important part in the multicultural aspect of Britain. English is the main language for 92% of the UK (48.9M people). Less than 5% of the population aged 3 to 15 had a main language other than English in 2011. Foreign languages are concentrated in London, where 21% of people don't speak English, or at least not well. These are the top 5 languages spoken at home other than English: Polish, Indian dialect, Arabic, French, and all other Chinese. However, in the UK, 1.6% of the British population doesn't speak English at all.
There are numerous cultural districts in which immigrants of a nation have settled and brought their culture with them to their new homeland. In Brick Lane, in London's East End, mainly people from Bangladesh have settled. There, for example, there are also street names that have been translated into Bengali under the English sign. The street is best known these days for its South Asian restaurants and street markets. Since the 19th century, the Richmond district has been shaped primarily by German immigrants. After a German school was founded there, the district became even more attractive as an emigration destination for Germans.
Multiculturalism can also be seen in food. 
From 2018 to 2019, there was a total of 103,379 hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales, and 8% of hate crimes were related to religion.
This multiculturalism is also caused by the increasing birth rate of other ethnic groups in England: in 2016, 90,500 births from other ethnic groups and in 2020, 158,000. 
London; a multicultural area?
In London, we find over 200 languages spoken and nearly one-third of the population was born abroad. It is considered the most multicultural city in Europe for some. As seen in the table above, only 43.4% are white British. This is because most of them are moving to the countryside instead of the city, which is a rural migration. It is a city filled with culturally diverse areas, especially Chinatown with its Chinese bakeries, restaurants, and supermarkets/stores, Camden Town and Brixton that was declared as the unofficial capital of British, African, and Caribbean descent. It is also home to many religions.

= = = Cathedral of Christ the Saviour = = =
The Cathedral of Christ the Savior (), is a Russian Orthodox cathedral located in Moscow on Sparrow Hill, on the banks of the Moskva River, it is known for having been demolished in the 1930s for the construction of the Palace of the Soviets, which was never made.
History.
The Original Cathedral had been built by order of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, in honor of Christ the Savior, stating on December 25, 1812: "To express our gratitude to Divine Providence for saving Russia from the Ruin that overshadowed it" (due to the Napoleonic Wars), the design of the cathedral was in charge of the architect Aleksandr Lavrentyevich Vitberg in 1817, who designed it with a Neoclassical design in the style of Masonic Symbolism, after the succession of Alexander I by his brother, Nicholas I, he would not like the architecture of the previous design and would hire his trusted architect Konstantin Thon.
The new architect would be based on the design of Neo-Byzantinism, and would be based on Hagia Sophia (Previously the Basilica of Saint Sophia until the Fall of Constantinople), in Istanbul and in 1832 the Russian Architectural Renaissance would be approved, in the place a old Convent and Church and the first stone would be laid until 1839, the interior would be painted by the best Russian painters of the time and the scaffolding would not be removed until 1860, and the dome would be placed using the Electroplating technique, and in 1882 Tchaikovsky would premiere the "1812 Overture", even though the cathedral was half finished, it would finally be consecrated on May 26, 1883, one day after the coronation of Alexander III, its interior had paintings of Russian saints and the Napoleonic withdrawal from Moscow.
After the Russian Revolution, the place was closed due to religious persecution in Russia.

= = = Xenohyla truncata = = =
Izecksohn's Brazilian tree frog ("Xenohyla truncata") is a frog that lives in Brazil. It is the only frog that eats fruit. Scientists have seen it no higher than 50 meters above sea level.
Some of these frogs live near sand dunes where there are cacti, shrubs, and bromeliad plants. The frogs can also live in trees where the adults hide in bromeliad plants. When it is time to lay eggs, they climb down to the forest floor. They lay eggs in pools of water that dry up for part of the year.
"Xenohyla truncata" is the only known amphibian that eats fruit. It finds the fruit and swallows it whole with no chewing. The seeds from the fruit come out of its body in its waste, which helps the plant spread. This frog only eats very small fruits and seeds, from 3 to 10 mm in size. Scientists think this frog could be a pollinator. It moves the tree's pollen, or seed-making material, from plant to plant as it looks for food. This is important because most of the pollinators we know of are insects and other animals without bones. This frog also eats insects and other animals with no bones and hard, jointed outsides.

= = = Bikini Atoll = = =
The Bikini atoll is a group of islands (an atoll) in the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Ralik chain. Today, it is part of the Marshall Islands. It used to be known as Eschscholtz Atoll. The atoll is made of 23 islands, which have a surface area of . The lagoon is about by , and has a surface area of about . The lagoon has a depth of up to . The two biggest islands are Bikini, at and Enyu, at . 
Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, is about to the south. New Guinea is about to the southwest.
Nuclear tests.
Today, the atoll is mostly known for many nuclear tests, done by the US government in the 1940s, and 1950s. In 1946, about 200 people were moved from these two islands, all other islands of the atoll were uninhabited. The people were moved to the smaller Rongerik Atoll, which was uninhabited at the time. 
Over 42.000 people were taking part in the nuclear tests. In total, 67 tests were done.
In the 1970s, about 100 people again moved to the islands, but they had to leave again, because high levels of Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 were found. Today, the atoll is largely uninhabited, except for a few caretakers.
Problems with islanders returning.
Even though the atoll may be habitable again soon, there's a problem: Many of the Bikini islanders (or their offspring) have never lived on the island, and haven't even visited it. There's a high unemployment rate on the Marshall islands. As the Marshall islands have a special agreement with the United States, unemployed people from the Marshall islands can go look for jobs in the United States. It is therefore unclear how many of the original islanders or their offspring will return to the atoll.

Javier Chércoles Blázquez born in Caracas (Venezuela) in 1964, is a director in fashion sector, university professor and crisis advisor in humanitarian disasters. 
Trajectory.
He holds a degree in Law from UNED and in Economics and Business from Universidad Complutense. 
Between 2000 and 2010 he worked for Inditex, a multinational based in Galicia. Chércoles was responsible for preparing Zara 's "Internal Code of Ethics", a document that regulates the operation of the factories that work for Inditex. 
He also worked for PwC . 
in Bangladesh.
In 2008, Chércoles went to Bangladesh to personally check the situation of a factory in Dhaka, where there were verbal and physical abuse, as well as salary cuts. Chércoles acknowledged that the factory was in "very bad" condition, but said there was no evidence they were manufacturing for Inditex. He later discovered that he was associated with another factory that produced clothes for Zara. The workshops were close to each other, and Chércoles admitted that it was possible to transfer part of the production from one to another without Inditex's permission or knowledge. A few years earlier he had discovered that the victims of the Bhopal disaster had not yet been compensated, because, as he told Kofi Annan, "there is no way to calculate them, nor any political intention (to pay them)". 
As CSR director, he decided to deepen labor controls in the production chain, control measures with which Inditex's management did not agree. In 2010 he left the position receiving 1.57 million euros. 
In April 2013, in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, the Rana Plaza building collapsed and 1,134 workers were killed. He was hired by Primark to pay 14 million euros to victims being the first multinational to deal with compensation. 
At the University.
He was voluntarily confined to the monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos for six months to write his doctoral thesis in the English language . Since June 2013, he has been working as a professor at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, at the Institute of Disaster &amp; Vulnerability Management Studies.
He was also a professor at Complutense, URJC and ESADE Universities and an academic lecturer at Harvard, Georgetown (United States), Andrés Bello (Caracas, Venezuela) and Antonio Ruiz de Montoya (Lima, Peru) universities

= = = Oedipus complex = = =
Oedipus complex is a term Sigmund Freud introduced. Freud said it was that someone wanted to have a sexual relationship with the parent of the opposite sex, and to kill the parent of the same sex. Freud uses the figure Oedipus, from Greek mythology: Oedipus killed a man in a fight, when he didn't know this man was his father, king Laios of Thebes. In that time, the Sphinx besieged Thebes, and gave riddles to those who passed. Those who weren't able to answer or solve the riddles, would be killed or eaten. Oedipus was able to solve the riddle, and as a prize, he received Iokaste, the widow of king Laios. He didn't know that Iokaste was his mother. The Sphinx was very ashamed that someone had been able to solve the riddle, and killed itself. 
Freud developed a whole theory, and he says that humans are driven, which is comomnly known as drive theory ("Triebtheorie" in German). He said that all children between ages three and five have what he called fantasies of incest. He also thought that the opposite case: the love of the same-sex parent, and the rivalry with the opposite-sex parent was normal. 
After Freud, people like Carl Gustav Jung made a difference between the Oedipus complex they associated with boys, and a similar phenomenon they called Electra complex they associated with girls.

= = = Giant virus = = =
A giant virus is a very large virus. They are sometimes called a girus. Some of them are larger than typical bacteria. All known giant viruses belong to the phylum Nucleocytoviricota.
The genomes of many giant viruses code for unusual genes which are not found in other viruses. These include genes involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, fermentation, and the cytoskeleton.
The first giant viruses to be described were discovered in 1981.
Note, in the illustration from an electron microscope, the virus is surrounded by a thick (~100 nm) layer of filamentous protein fibres.
Origin.

= = = Gutian people = = =
The Guti () or Quti, also known by the derived Gutians or Guteans, were a nomadic people of West Asia, around the Zagros Mountains (Modern Iran) during ancient times. 
History.
Their homeland was known as Gutium (Sumerian: ,"Gu-tu-umki" or ,"Gu-ti-umki"). There has been little scholarly support for theories linking the Turkic names Kutrigur and Utigur to the Gutians. Widely believed to have spoken an Indo-European (rather than Turkic) language. Iranologist W. B. Henning proposed that the Yuezhi were descended from the Guti (Gutians) and a closely associated but little known tribe referred to as the Tukri (Turki), who were native to the Zagros mountains during the mid-3rd millennium BC. Analysing the grammatical structure of the Gutian language, German Assyriologists Benno Landsberger, however, came to the conclusion that the Gutians not only were closely related to Turkic peoples, but most probably even identical.

= = = Scinax ruber = = =
The red-snouted tree frog, Allen's snouted tree frog, common snouted tree frog or two-striped snouted tree frog ("Scinax ruber") is a frog that lives in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador and the Guianas. Human beings also brought it to Puerto Rico.
The adult male frog is 3.1 to 3.7 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 4.0 to 4.2 cm long. The male frog is yellow or almost white in color and the female frog is brown or gray in color. This frog has dark brown spots down its sides and yellow or orange spots on its legs and middle.
This frog lives in trees and looks for food at night. This frog can lay eggs at any time, but it usually does when the weather is rainy. The male frog sits on a tree branch over the water and sings for the female frog. The female frog lays her eggs, about 590 eggs at a time, on plants near the water. When the tadpoles hatch from the eggs, they fall into the water.

= = = Vantablack = = =
Vantablack is a substance made of carbon nanotubes. Scientists at Surrey NanoSystems invented it in 2014. They invented it so scientists and engineers could use it in inventions. In 2016, artists started fighting over Vantablack, for example Anish Kapoor and Stuart Semple.
Vantablack can absorb 99.965 percent of the light that hits it. Because it absorbs so much light, it looks very dark and black. In 2014, it was the blackest black thing in the world. It could make a flat circle look like a deep hole. Artist Anish Kapoor thought Vantablack would be good in art. In 2016, Kapoor made a deal with Surrey NanoSystems. He bought the exclusive rights to use Vantablack in art. This means Kapoor is the only artist allowed to use that black paint.
Some artists did not like that Kapoor wanted to be the only artist who could use Vantablack paint. For example, Christian Furr said "All the best artists have had a thing for pure black – Turner, Manet, Goya... This black is like dynamite in the art world. We should be able to use it. It isn't right that it belongs to one man."
Another artist Stuart Semple invented another pigment in 2016. He named it "Pinkest Pink". Semple sold Pinkest Pink to other artists on his website. But he added words to the order form in which his buyers had to promise not to give any Pinkest Pink to Anish Kapoor:
By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.
Semple said: "I thought I might sell one or two, but the website itself would be almost like a piece of performance art, and the pink jar would be like an artwork." This means he did not think many people would care that he was not selling his pink paint to Anish Kapoor. He also said he did it "to raise a dialogue in a debate about ownership and elitism and privilege and access to the arts".
Anish Kapoor found out about Semple's rule. He posted a picture on Instagram. The picture had a jar of Pinkest Pink and a middle finger (an insulting hand signal) covered in Pinkest Pink.
Many people saw Kapoor's Instagram picture. They wrote to Semple asking him to make a black paint like Vantablack. In 2017, Semple made black pigments called "Better Black", "Black 2.0" and "Black 3.0". He made a glitter paint called "Diamond Dust". He would not sell any to Anish Kapoor. Semple's black paint was not as black as Vantablack, but it was very, very black. It was also much easier to use and cost much less money. One tube of Black 3.0 cost ₤21.99. Semple also opened an art store in London and said he would not let Anish Kapoor come inside it.
Anish Kapoor told Buzzfeed news that his lawyers would take action against Semple because Semple was using his name so people would buy paint from him. Semple said later that Kapoor never sued him.
In 2019, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made a paint even blacker than Vantablack. This paint could absorb 99.995 percent of light. MIT artist Diemut Strebe made artwork using this paint: Strebe painted a $2 million yellow diamond black with this paint. This made the diamond almost disappear. Strebe named the artwork "The Redemption of Vanity". It is at the New York Stock Exchange.
Strebe and the scientists said "The project can also be interpreted as a statement against British artist Anish Kapoor's purchase of" Vantablack. They said any artist who wanted could use their new paint.

= = = Chiasmocleis = = =
Chiasmocleis is a genus of frogs in the family Microhylidae. They live in tropical South America north and east of the Andes. English speakers call them humming frogs or silent frogs.
Taxonomy.
Scientists have trouble deciding where to put this genus because it looks like not all of these frogs have the same ancestor. As of mid 2021, scientists agreed to put frogs that used to be in the genus "Syncope" into "Chiasmocleis", but they also agreed to make three clades into subgenera:
Of these, "Relictocleis" is the most different from the other two. Some scientists think it should be its own genus. "Relictocleis gnoma" would be its only species.
Description.
"Chiasmocleis" frogs have small bodies and small legs. The male and female frogs look different: Male frogs have darker chins, and some of them have spines. The frogs from the subgenus "Syncope" are even smaller and have fewer bones in their paws and tose. "Relictocleis" frogs are also very small.
Ecology.
"Chiasmocleis" live underground some or most of the time. They are hard to see against dirt or dead leaves. They only look for food on the surface for a few days during the time when they lay eggs. This is at the beginning of the rainy season. They live in both forests and open places.
Species.
These species are in "Chiasmocleis":

= = = AB Aurigae b = = =
Aurigae b (or AB Aur b) is a protoplanet in the Protoplanetary disk of the star AB Aurigae. The star is about 505 light years from Earth. It is a young star, about two million years old. The star and everything in its system are in its early stages. In this growing solar system, astronomers can see the formation of the new gas giant. They can learn if the theories they have created about how stars are formed are correct. 
The current theory of “core accretion” says that planets are formed from small objects collecting dust, gas, and other materials as they all orbit a star. 
Aurigae b has about 9 times the mass of Jupiter. This would make it about 12,000 times bigger than Earth. The planet has an orbit of 8.6 billion miles from its star. This is twice the distance between our sun and Pluto. It is thought that core accretion could not happen this far from a star. 
An other theory. called “disk instability”, says that Aurigae b could have been formed in a more “top-down” process. It say that the protoplanetary disk is cooling and quickly breaking up. When this happens, gravity causes gas and matter to come together and form new planets. 
These findings come from an international team who used the adaptive optics system, infrared spectrography, and visible camera of the Subaru Telescope as well as the Hubble Space Telescope. The team was only able to collect solid evidence by using a variety of techniques and working with different groups. The findings were published by the University of Arizona. Their findings are creating a large number of discussions because this evidence supports what might be new facts in astronomy

The adult male frog is 18.0 to 19.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.0 to 30.0 mm long. It lives in primary and secondary forest. It lives in the same area as other frogs with the same ancestor frog: "Chiasmocleis bassleri" and "Ctenophryne geayi". It looks for food at night. People tend to see them sitting on plants no more than 25 cm above the ground.
When it is time to lay eggs, the male frogs go to ponds. They sing together for the female frogs. The female frogs lay eggs near the surface of the water. The tadpoles swim alone near the surface of the water during the day.
Scientsts found red ants in the stomach of one humming frog. They think this frog eats ants.

During his prime he was considered as one of the greatest defensive midfielders in the world.
Early days.
Andrade was born in Salto in 1901 to an Argentine mother. José Ignacio Andrade, who is said to have been his father, is listed on his birth certificate as a witness. The elder Andrade, who was 98 years old when José Leandro Andrade was born, was an expert in African magic and is said to be an African-born slave who escaped from Brazil. At an early age, Andrade went to live with his aunt in a slum in Montevideo.
Prior to the introduction of professional football in Uruguay, Andrade held a number of jobs. At one point he worked as a carnival musician, playing mainly the drums. At various times in his life he also worked as a shoe shiner and as a newsboy.
Club career.
In addition to his passion for music, Andrade was an avid footballer. In youth he played football for Miramar Misiones. In the early 1920s, Andrade signed with Bella Vista, where he went on to play 71 games and score 7 goals. It was at Bella Vista that Andrade was first selected to the national team. Andrade later moved to Nacional where he became four-time Uruguayan champions and three national cups. In 1930, Andrade moved to CA Peñarol, where he played 88 games in the years that followed. Andrade had previously trained with the club as a teenager but was not hired at the time. From the mid - 1930s, Andrade played for several Argentine clubs including CA Atlanta and CA Lanús CA Talleres. He also played a short stint with Wanderers in Uruguay before ending his career.
International career.
Andrade played 34 caps for the Uruguay national football team between 1923 and 1930, scoring once. 
South American Championship.
Andrade won the South American Championship (predecessor to the Copa América ) of 1923, 1924 and 1926.
1924 Summer Olympics.
Andrade won his first Olympic gold medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. He was recognized as the first black international footballer in the Olympics. He was nicknamed maravilla negra ( the black miracle ), a nickname later used for Pelé.
After winning the Summer Olympics, the Uruguayans were challenged by Argentina to a diptych. In the second game at the Estadio Sportivo Barracas in Buenos Aires, Andrade was pelted with stones by the Argentine crowd, to which Andrade and his teammates responded by throwing the stones back. In the ensuing riots, a teammate was arrested and the Uruguayans refused to play out the rest of the game.
1928 Summer Olympics.
In 1928 Andrade won his second Olympic gold medal at the 1928 Summer Olympics, held in Amsterdam. During the semi-final against Italy, Andrade collided with one of the goal posts, resulting in a serious injury to his eye. This later deteriorated to the point that he became blind in that eye.
1930 FIFA World Cup.
Despite not being at his peak, Andrade managed to become one of Uruguay's best players in the tournament, which the Uruguayans won. At the end of the tournament, he was named to the "All-Star team". In 1994 he was selected by France Football as number ten in their World Cup Top 100.
A plaque was placed in the Estadio Centenario in honor of his achievements.
Life after football.
Andrade was a guest at the 1950 World Cup, when Uruguay won the tournament for the second time. His cousin Víctor Rodríguez Andrade, a member of the 1950 winning team, had adopted Andrade as his middle name in honor of José Leandro Andrade. 
In 1956, when he was discovered by the German journalist Fritz Hack, he had descended from alcoholism and was living in a small flat in a poor area of ​​Montevideo. 
Andrade died in 1957 in the Piñeyro del Campo nursing home in Montevideo from the effects of tuberculosis. His burial took place at Cementerio del Cerro, Montevideo.

Compound's things like six nine, six nine erm 
Nine twelve 
Yeah.
That sort of stuff.
At the top.
That's the top number.
Erm.
And compound is three four.
Tha that's comp that's compound.
Now compound is always six.
Oh.
Simple is just ordinary three beats a bar,
Yeah.
four beats in a bar, two beats in a bar.
It's the compou think of compound as being the one that's more difficult to think about.
Six eight times, nine eight times.
Yeah.
Right.
Still leaves three two three or four beats in a bar, but they're compound times.
They're dotted beats.
That's really all that compound means.
It means dotted beats.
Erm  what would twelve  twelve four?
Think about twelve four cos that's a compound time.
It's got twelve at the top.
Erm it may help to look at it.
Cos you can't think about it straight away.
Think  twelve, and it'll be twelve what?
Dotted semi-quavers.
No.
What does four stand for in an ordinary time signature?
Oh crotchets.
Right so 
So.
if there are twelve of those.
Twelve crotchets.
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve.
Think of them in groups of threes  and that gives you four  dotted?
Quavers.
No.
Semi-quavers.
You're, you're going small
Yes.
and you've got to go the other way.
Oh yeah.
It's erm
If there are tw if there are twelve crotchets and each of those are in groups of three.
Dotted minims.
So you've got four dotted minims.
So twelve, I mean if you can remember them twelve stands for four beats in a bar anyway
Yeah.
and  if you just think what twelve crotchets are going to be divided up into
Mm.
it's going to dotted minims.
Cos you know it's going to be dotted something or other.
And if you were to see  er an extract of music  for example here's a twelve eight one.
This one actually tells you it's in twelve eight time.
And it's asking you to put in the bar lines.
Where would you  put those bar lines do you think?
It would al I think it probably also asks you to  to group them properly.
But just for the moment we won't worry about the grouping aspect.
I think, assume everything starts on the first beat of the bar as well.
Okay.
It'll tell you if it doesn't.
Erm
Eight stands for ?
Quavers.
Right  
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve .
So obviously the first one would be there.
And probably if it's going to be a whole one 
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve.
So in fact there are just two bars.
Now how would you actually group  those notes?
Erm  it'd be groups of three again wouldn't it?
In groups of three.
Those two've got to be grouped together.
One two three four 
Er  it'd be sort of half of that.
Half of the erm crotchet.
I don't know how you do that.
Can we go backwards.
One two three four five 
You can only do it if you miss out that.
One two three.
One two three.
And that leaves you with a  a little bit  
Right.
Yes.
It actually explains it.
Exactly what they want you to do.
Er where you've got a note that obviously goes over a beat  as in that one there
Yeah.
you're, you're going to have to write two quavers and tie them.
Is that what you said?
Yeah.
It might have been what you said .
So those two  okay.
That one will be joined to a quaver beat, so that you'll have a group of three.
And another quaver, those two will be tied  the join taking them onto the next group of three and so on.
So basically you're splitting this in compound time?
Yes.
So it it'd still sound
Cos that, that actually looks as though it's the half way part of the bar too doesn't it?
So, and you, you don't actually go over the half 
Yeah.
way part of the bar with one single note.
If you've got a note it's got to be held.
You actually split into two an and use a tie.
If you're in two time or four time which you are.
You're in four  four dotted  crotchets beats there aren't they?
You will sometimes be asked to  er look at something like that and then put the time signature in.
These have got the time signature in but you're, they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly.
As in that one, you've go you've got to alter what they actually put there.
Not going to alter the sound of it.
The sound must still be the same but you've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes.
That may happen in any of those.
I wonder if they've got any here now that haven't got  any time signatures, because that's the other thing that they  they like to give you.
Down here.
Add time signatures.
Alright.
Let's see what you can make of first of all that one.
And whether they're all compound, they may not all be compound.
Some may be, some may not.
I don't know.
Find the simplest bar  in each one.
this one.
Looking through it that is the simplest one cos you can see 
Yes.
at a glance there are two 
It's all, it's all 
groups of three aren't there?
Yeah.
So that's obviously going to be in compound time.
What though?
Erm
Fairly easy to put in a time signature.
Six twelve.
Six er  now wait a minute.
What's  four is for crotchets.
Eight is for quavers.
Double it again, sixteen.
Six sixteen.
It's gonna be sixteen.
So six sixteen.
And that actually means two dotted crotch two dotted quavers I mean, doesn't it?
Cos each group adds up to a dotted quaver.
Mm.
So it
Yeah.
As you've got here.
That's right.
In fact, if anything, which is the easiest way round of doing it?
To be, if you're asked to put in a time signature?
It's not always so easy to  to group notes.
I think people find that more difficult than actually saying what a time signature is.
Mhm.
What about that one?
Erm
Take the simplest bar.
Three quavers.
So the time signature is?
Erm  three eight.
Three eight.
Now 
And it's grouped in a dotted crotchet.
Yes it is.
Now is that compound or is that simple?
Three eight is simple.
It's simple because it's just got three at the top.
Mm.
It looks as if it ought to be with the compound ones but it's not.
It's just an ordinary simple one.
But it's quaver beats instead of crotchet beats, that's all.
So that was a simple one, that one was a compound one.
We'll do one more.
What about this one?
Is there an easy ?
No they're, they're all, virtually all exactly the same
Erm
timing aren't they?
They're not quite the same.
two three  four five six
Yeah.
six erm  six four.
Yes.
Six four which is dotted?
Minims.
Two dotted minims.
Yes, yes.
Two dotted minims in a bar.
That's one of them.
And that, in fact that's probably the simplest bar isn't it?
Because
Mm.
that's a group of three.
Much the same as a dotted, dotted minim.
Erm simple or compound time then?
It's 
Six 
six four
four
that's simple.
No, compound.
Compound.
Two, three, four or five would be simple times.
Six, twelve  They sound more complicated 
Mm.
so think of them as being compound.
Right.
That way round then isn't so difficult.
That I think you  I think most people find it more difficult having to group the notes in the right, in exactly the right way.
So  I think.
This is actually a grade four one.
We'll lead up gradually  to grade five .
Yeah.
I'm not going to go all the way back through  grades two and three.
You started on two I think.
Or you've got Book Two.
We'll go, we'll go from 
I think .
here.
And anything that you find you don't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you don't know.
Because you're not going to have to go back on many of the things.
This book, these books are quite good because they do give you a little bit of explanation.
You've also got er other books or another book at home which you can refer to if you need any extra.
Erm it might be an idea to go back.
You won't find you're going to take much time doing some of these.
If you do exercise one  for the time being don't worry about that one, exercise three.
Shall I write it down?
Yes, it would be a good idea, wouldn't it?
Mm.
Do you want to write on the back of  
It would be  because you've already got some in here haven't you?
I think I probably 
Yeah.
Actually I'll carr I'll carry on on  
And the date today is  the 
The twenty  eighth I think.
Ah the twenty eighth.
It's the next thing on isn't it ?
So if you're looking in the grade four book  put down page four, exercise one.
If you have a look at each one of those.
Rather than write them in the book, just put the answers down either on a  on a piece of paper.
As long as you put clearly what it is you're putting in.
Then I can just use these books over and over again.
It's a bit pointless writing in them.
When it comes to exercise three  that's on page five, exercise three.
When it says add bar lines it won it won't hurt you to actually write those out.
Because 
Okay.
you really need to group the notes.
Well the notes are grouped but you're gonna add the .
Write it out because it's all good practice for 
for you actually.
At er writing out notes as well.
So  you can do exercise three.
Not that one for now because that's doing something different.
Now which are the ones that you've got to  to group?
So far  over here.
Right.
Page  page eight starts  exercise six.
In fact do  all of those.
Do A through to F.
And that's grouping notes  plus the bar lines.
The later ones are always quite hard.
And they've given you  they've actually given you, not in this one, but they do give you the clefs here.
They've given you the clefs.
Did we look at those before?
Alto clefs and tenor clefs?
Er  don't think so.
Have you come across those before?
come across these.
You've come across the treble and the bass right?
and the bass, not these alto or whatever.
Erm if  just take  just think of singers at the moment.
Soprano is the highest, then an alto 
Soprano, then an alto , tenor, bass 
tenor and bass.
Soprano is the highest voice.
Then comes the alto.
Then the tenor and then the bass at the .
Oh right.
So is
So 
that's that's alto.
So is that  one up from
It's one down from 
the treble.
Think of it as being the next lot down if you like.
Then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef.
The only reason that, that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle C in a different place.
On the stave.
So that for example an alto doesn't need so many  notes, high notes, but needs a few more lower notes.
So if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using at all.
And having to add a lot of low ledger line notes.
That saves doing that.
Because they position middle C.
Middle C's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle C.
Which means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes.
Although this has got one or two.
But not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower  this is wha , that isn't a particularly good example really because  it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these  lines.
Soprano wouldn't go down that far.
A soprano would only go down to about  erm  oh about what?
Middle C is probably a bit too low for, for most sopranos.
But an alto would go a lot lower, would go down probably to an F or a G.
So that these notes would be low.
If that's middle C you can te what would the bottom line actually be?
Bottom line?
That's C
Er it would
It's here.
er G.
C A F, you're right, yes.
Erm so that in fact  a true alto would be using most of the notes there.
And just a few ledger lines above.
Unlikely to be using  whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time   
F G.
Yes.
And then the other one, the tenor clef.
Have they given you a tenor clef?
No.
They'll give you a tenor clef a little bit further on.
They may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade  grade five now I come to think about that.
But there's no point in
Not learning it 
about it now because it's  just as easy really.
Tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle C is now there.
Next line up in fact.
So  because a tenor sings a little bit lower  you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher  notes before you need to add  start adding ledger line notes.
Sometimes of course you'll, they'll still need ledger line notes up there.
And perhaps one down there but  not very likely.
So it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at.
Just means you have to get used to thinking, right if that's  if, if that's er er a tenor clef then that note won't be  it would be, be an A in a bass clef and F in a treble clef.
What will it be for that clef?
In this  erm  oh 
Going downwards going backwards is, is more difficult isn't it?
Yeah.
Much easier working upwards from C.
That line's C.
So that line 
C. 
would be?
C A F D
Er C A  E  You go one below it.
Oh yeah.
You know F is next in fact C yes.
That's A, that's F, that would be D so it's between the two which, which is an E.
And if you were going above of course, that note would be?
E.
E and remember that it's the E just above middle C.
And that's the E
Does the middle C 
always come up on a line?
Well it's  yes it does in fact.
Mm.
I hadn't actually thought of that before.
But yes it does seem to.
I suppose theoret theoretically you could actually move middle C to wherever you wanted to have it.
But generally speaking they us they use just the four clefs.
Now  certain instruments use the  alto clef.
Just a minute.
Hello.
Oh hello.
Alright.
Right I'll fetch him, I'll fetch him.
Yes he's here.
Oh somewhere he is.
He's jus just upstai he's just upstairs so I shan't be a moment I'll go and call him .
Gosh she's going to have fun with this tape.
Go on out you go.
Right  Yes.
So middle C then can be almost anywhere.
Yeah.
What instrument  do you know about  do you think  that uses something other than the treble clef  and a bass clef?
Or have you come across the one that
Erm  instrument that I know.
Well that, that you might know.
It's not actually a percussion one but it's er  in fact I don't, I think most of the percussion ones tend to use a  a bass clef don't they?
Yeah, yeah.
If you see one at all.
Yeah or  erm  xylophones  and glocks and those.
Except they use treble and bass 
They use the treble don't they?
Yes.
Er  Bass or whatever.
Yeah.
Xylophone.
Yes, it's a treble.
And a vibraphone?
Just   I've got one of those nice little  
Yes.
It's just like a, a small  sort of piano.
Doesn't have a very long 
key keyboard.
It doesn't I don't think.
Quite an 
It's a piano and it's 
odd range.
It's very high.
Because in fact although it's written from there all the way up to there, erm  that is it starts at the C above middle C and goes up 
Yeah.
to very high  the unfortunate thing 
snare drum.
I think that's played  on the bass  what would be on the piano an A.
Yes.
It, it, they 
use cert certain lines don't they?
They use yeah erm  
So that you, you get to know what is 
I think it's er
what is what.
A is the bass drum.
Yeah.
er
I think it's G they use as the high-hat and there's all sorts of things.
Yeah.
I don't thing they  one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score
Yeah.
which  oh do they?
No they don't.
No.
Which of course I'll ask yeah I've got plenty of those sort 
Mm.
of things anyway.
You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five.
You, you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge.
You, you don't have to, need to know anything in, in depth but you've got to know 
But you've got to know shallow a wider range.
Yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot.
There's  erm an alto, no, yes an alto clef, isn't it?
For  trombone, no, it's not, it's for, yes it's for one of the trombones, isn't it?
Tuba.
Oh I erm found out what that  brass instrument we couldn't think of.
What was it?
Euphonium.
Euphon yes.
You're erm   isn't it silly
Mm.
I've, I've 
because  you see I could see wh exactly what you were talking about in my mind 
Mm.
but I could not think of its name.
Yeah.
I got into the car and I was still erm thinking all about this 
It's, it's, yeah.
and my mother said straight away, oh you're thinking of a euphonium.
Yeah.
That's the one.
Yes.
It's so silly isn't it when er  you know that you knew it all the time.
Now then.
The one I'm looking for is what, have I got to the strings yet?
No I haven't got back to the strings.
These just use the bass or the treble clef.
And when you get back  to the    There we are.
The strings.
It's the viola that we're actually looking for.
Sort of bass violin.
Sort of bass violin, yes .
There we are.
That's the one that uses it.
So that you see even in a score it would be written like that.
So that's the only, only instrument that you generally see, actually see using it  in most, most schools.
Unless you're going into some of the tenor  erm  and alto 

Can I sign those for accuracy, please?
I'm taking the silence to be assent.
Matters arising on those minutes on page one.
On minute one one four, I'm using my privilege as a chair to hang on to that; the fact that the Poly are to hold a conference on health and housing in the new year.
I've asked that members be invited to that, I'm sure some of you'd be interested to do that.
You may recall that this committee has asked for a health and housing conference but we seem to get under it rather a lot of times, nothing it appears to be happening.
Can I have your agreement that we write to the director of housing and ask for his position on it?
Will you agree that we do that, rather than have the same thing coming up time after time.
Anything else on page one?
Also on that, chair, just to clarify the situation, because I know it's a bit vague, we are erm asking the health authority to run the erm meeting with other local authority counties, do you remember?
The referral agency's to be in B?
Right, lovely.
We're doing that.
Great, thank you very much indeed for that.
On page 2, matters arising.
Sheila?
One one six, chair.
I would like to congratulate the officers for that day.
It was a very educational day, but extremely harrowing afternoon, which is still living with me.
And I would like to say at this point I was very disappointed that we didn't have any other conservatives with us in the afternoon.
Could I suggest probably in future that if we do that we have the harrowing parts in the morning so everybody can see it.
Can I say about that little dig at the conservatives, I did actually have 
No, we were expressing our sorrow, Graham, I assure you
Yes, well, I have had a recent case, erm of within the ward that I visited, so I am aware of having the number of problems in the past, I am aware of the problems, but I could not for personal circumstances do the afternoon that day.
I understand, Graham
I do rather resent it when there are other council committees, there's Town Hall Strategy Working Party in the afternoon, now if we're going to be sure that we can all get to this without conflict with other committees, erm I had to be there on behalf of the Lord Mayor because she had duties, erm and I was very sorry not to be able to come, because I have dealt, visited many  occupational, I wanted to visit the officers, and you know, it isn't always possible where you have a conflict of interests.
Is it possible perhaps if when we have another day, I take the point that perhaps the morning's but then again we're bound to miss something else, If we can have it a day that is clear of other city councils 
It may be 
Could meet before 
that if we pass on some of your comments at the end of the section, maybe they'll be able to arrange, maybe in two or three months time a visit that most of us can make, particularly those of you who missed it, because it is an important experience, but obviously quite difficult to arrange, because it involves real tenants and real people but we can pass that back, and I'm sure the officers will consider it.
Chair, erm on that, if that could be arranged in two or three months time, perhaps we can see how the Charter of Commerce is working out, because I think many of us are very interested to see how it is working out, we could erm discuss with somebody who's in bed-and-breakfast, who could then erm tell us how the Charter of Commerce is working.
Very appropriate remark, Michael, the charter is up for review at any event, very shortly, because it was on a six-month trial as it were.
So I agree with that, thank you.
Page three?
Yes, on page three, one twenty, chair, we asked for a date, the date of that conference is the thirteenth and fourteenth of December.
That's probably helping Nora.
It's not on the minutes, but just to remind you, the thirteenth and fourteenth of December, thanks Tony.
Is it to be in the Town Hall?
Is it in the Town Hall, Tony?
Blessed if I can remember, chair, no.
In St Catherine's, Vice Chair suggests.
Page four?
On page five, those of you who were at the last council meeting will know that the City Centre Management Working Party were charged with the responsibility of looking at the whole issue of street trading.
They have now done that and they will be making a report, I hope, fairly shortly, either to us or  or both.
On item four on page five, you'll see that we said ‘relevant papers to be sent to all members of council’.
Pragmatically, I suggested to the officers that a summary of those papers be sent to all members of council in the interests of saving paper, and that if you see something you want to know more about, you then go and talk to David Turner, is that agreeable?
Otherwise you will be inundated with paper.
Item one two four, Highways and Traffic do not agree with us on touting.
And I'm sure we shall sit quietly over that.
Page six, Matters Arising, page seven, yes?
I was just going to ask if we have a diary?
Tony?
Not at this stage, chair, next committee you should have.
Thank you.
Okay?
Can we use item one two nine on the minutes, first of all to say that some of us were at the H I V awareness training session last week, with Robin, we enjoyed it enormously, she's hiding behind the thing.
Looking for the right word!
So we want to say ‘thank you very much’ to Robin, and also, this is our opportunity to learn officially that Robin is leaving our employment, I think in February?
Yes.
And it's an opportunity for her and me to say a couple of words to us, and for us certainly to thank her very much for her service.
I just wanted to let you know that in February, won't be hiding behind an OHP, erm I'll be taking up a post with the European Commission, working with Aids services throughout Europe.
erm I'm very sad to be leaving Oxford, I've very much enjoyed working here, and it's been good to work for a council with such a high commitment to H I V, and to fighting Aids, and erm I very much the support I've had from the committee and I hope it will continue erm in this way.
So thank you very much.
I'm sure Health committee's commitment to the post will continue.
And I'm sure I speak on behalf of you all when I say thank you very much indeed to Robin, you've done an excellent job, and we shall miss you.
Thanks.
Can I chair just draw your attention to one or two items.
I hope this committee will, since everybody else is doing it, yet again, my absolute, the officers and the management on Northway Community Centre
It's on the agenda Betty, you'll have another bite at this cherry.
Oh is it?
Yes
Oh, sorry, right.
Anything else on page seven?
Most items are on the agenda, actually.
On page eight, item one three two, can I draw committee's attention to, says she, feverishly flicking through the pieces of paper, to a letter that John Patten has written to us, you'll see what we asked Amanda to do on our behalf, Amanda Root, Women's Sub also asked her to do that, and John Patten, surprisingly enough has written back, his private secretary has written back, she continues to say, ‘Mr Patten is used to getting communications from Chief Officers conveying the views of committees, he has never had any correspondence from Sub-Committees through other officers’.
Now, I wonder whether the opposition members might not like to take that up with their M P.
I think an MP is there to respond to correspondence, and I'm very surprised that he takes issue with one of our officers because she doesn't happen to be the Chief Officer, and I'm very sad about that.
Can I just ask, I'm not usually a member of this committee as you know.
So you might be out-of-order in speaking, in fact.
Can I say that sub-committees, as I understand it, report to main committees?
Yes they do.
So, in fact, had that decision gone to the main committee, or is it going, is it coming here now.
This was a decision of main committee, on page eight.
I understood it in fact from what you said that it was a decision of the sub-committee.
Women's sub also happened to say the same thing.
Yes, Mavis?
Sorry, if I could just clarify, I was actually at the meeting of Women's Sub, erm as was Robin in fact, and they, the Women's Sub-Committee considered the minute of this committee, and endorsed erm, in fact, Amanda didn't write until the meeting of women's sub, because it was being considered by them, but erm they didn't add anything substantial to what was this committee had said and they did.
I just think it is, in fact, a great shame that the MP only acknowledges some letters if they happen to have the kind of status that he appreciates.
I don't think there's a defence for that.
Betty?
Well, he seems to have been conspicuous by has absence in respect to these things.
He has been invited to talk to other committees in the past and has decided not to do so.
Now, I don't take very kindly to that.
Whatever he thinks of the political make-up of this council, he owes a duty to the city and to his council.
And I think this is a an another example of how little he seems to care for this city.
Well, on the specific issue, which is item one three two, are we agreed that we write quite clear but nonetheless firm letter to Mr Patten, explaining that we are minded to ask him to comment on these matters, it this time comes from the Chair and the Chief Officer about and perhaps he will therefore take it more seriously.
Are we agreed that we do that?
Graham?
I was just going to say that I'm sure he it's not that he didn't take it seriously.
It may well be he felt that there wasn't necessarily the full authority of the city council and administration sub committee.
Now clearly, he responds every day to individuals of the public.
Here, I can only think that he was saying, ‘well, we don't know that there's the full authority of the city council in this view’, but erm I'm not going to put up a defence, I just think that what we do is basically stress from yourself and from the chief officer that we do want this file known.
Could I have a copy of the letter, please, can I take it up?
You certainly can, Anne, thank you.
Other matters arising on page eight, you'll see on item one three four that we did investigate the possibility, did we, have we got a response on that, of an officer being part of the joint care planning team.
I wonder if the county have responded to that, yet?
We haven't had a response.
We haven't got a response, fine, okay.
Item eight, any more Matters Arising?
Item, erm sorry, page nine, on the Food Safety Act, we did write, the Chief did write, to Andrew Smith, to ask about the position on the Food Safety Act, as far as monies go, and I will read you the response, it was a question in parliament.
‘The Government has estimated that local authorities in England will need to spend twenty four point seven million pounds in ninety-one, ninety-two to carry out the additional duties resulting from the Food Safety Act.
This additional cost is being taken into account in a total of aggregate external finance.
The post to be twenty-six point oh five billion which will be distributed to Local Authorities on the basis of standard spending assessments.
My Right Honourable Friend will be announcing our imposing Standard Spending Assessments in the near future.’
The implications for us are that we shall have to find it very hard to ensure that we get a share of that grant to spend on implementation of the Food Safety Act.
I would suggest that the government would be a lot, lot better adding a ticket to amounts of money, which said ‘You either spend this money on implementing the Food Safety Act, or you don't get it.’
Future Labour Government's committed itself to doing that, and I would suggest that the Secretary of State should do it, because we're not guaranteed to receive that money at all.
erm Anything else on page nine? erm On Nestlé, Chief's reminded me that we have got, I received today, a long letter from Nestlé, basically saying they won't be coming today.
I shall make that letter available to the solicitor who we have asked to check out with Estates, and with other authorities regarding the way forward, if we wish to make any public statements about our dealings with Nestlé.
I'm not putting it around the table, because it's a very long letter, and I don't think we could have a worthwhile discussion on it right now.
Yes, chair,actually gave it to this headed copy of it to consolidate erm with regard to contacting Leicester and Leeds Councils that have also sort of taken action against Nestlé, that's still being done.
The officer at Leicester's not available at the moment, so he hopes by the next meeting erm if Leeds have an opportunity to see that letter, and perhaps have a short report on what this council does with respect to Nestle/1  and also what other councils have done.
Michael?
Yes, erm, going back to the original thing that brought this up, that we should descry people from using Nestlé's products, erm, in fact implications will be quite wide, because they now own Rowntrees, and they own Cross and Blackwells, and they own all sorts of other companies.
Now, is it the intention of the people who asked us to take this action that we should just boycott Nestles products, or we should do the whole range of the conglomerate that owns all these people like Rowntrees and Cross and Blackwell, and many other companies as well.
Because this, erm, I think it's quite far-reaching to erm get all hot on this, and I don't think we realised the full implications.
Yes, the implications are very heavy, I had not realised what you'd just said, and we should refer that to Amanda and indeed take all take it on board, otherwise we'll be taking on the world.
Yes, probably should.
And probably should, yes.
Item one four oh, believe it or not, Doctor Root did write to Mr Patten on this issue, and guess what he wrote back?
‘I've received a letter from your Health Promotion erm Liaison Officer, can I ask you if this was sent on your behalf?’
‘On which committee meeting was the letter considered?’, he doesn't trust anybody, this guy, does he?
I propose the same action again.
He's obviously keen on structures and procedure is the Right Honourable Gentleman 
Must be a past experience!
Yes.
Well, he's taking a lot longer and costing us a lot more money in terms of letting us know his view.
Actually, to comply with the minute, it should go to the City Environmental Chief Officer.
Yes.
Well, as you know, we always say the City Environmental Health Officer, and the officer responsible then does the work, we've seen to that on our committee for years 
If you look at a department like the Director and Engineers department, every letter in fact has underneath it the City Engineer, even if its signed by somebody else.
I mean it is a possibility, and if he's going to be awkward perhaps we'll have to just make sure that we do that, which is presumably fairly easy, if the post goes out from the same office.
I take your point Anne, but I would prefer to help the MP understand that the nature of the way that this department is run is that officers do take responsibility for their specialist areas of work, the senior management has always supported that, and I don't feel minded to change it because the MP finds it difficult.
Well, I certainly will take it up if I get a copy letter, I mean it is obviously that some departments act differently, and I understand that in any case this is only a letter from the secretary, it's not him, so I mean, I'm quite happy to take it up if I get the copy of that, and explain that this department act, does rather differently from some of the others.
And we shall certainly do that as well.
Chair, the letters that do go, the majority of the letters that go to MPs and members are signed by me, though they're prepared by the officer who's the expert in different fields, but these two letters went when I happened to be away from the department, and that's fair enough, I'd rather they went than sat around waiting for my return.
But, they also go on headed note paper which says Oxford City Council Environmental Health Department and all the other stuff we put on the top, erm and it's perfectly clear that they do come from the City Department upon your behalf.
He's being awfully bumptious, let's be honest.
Chair, can I just help you here recently, because we've had a recent case ourselves erm, this is an ironic twist to this, because Councillor Patten's being writing to the County on Highway and Traffic issues recently and sending us a copy, and it's stunned us a little bit, because normally they would write to us direct, but there's a sting in this because we don't know whether we're supposed to respond to him now, or   the county.
And the county don't send us copy letters, so, chair it does need sorting out as far as we're concerned as well.
It really does doesn't it.
I can see the Press headline: ‘MP with knickers in twist’Anything else on page ten.
Okay, apologies for absence and substitution.
Chair, I have none, I'm afraid.
May I say that Mrs Kurtz, I would have thought has sent her apologies, and I'm substituting for her 
Sorry, I should explain to the committee that I was informed that the secretary who normally does the minutes for the half past one was sick, and had, she'd been sent home by her doctor at lunch time, so I came back from lunch and had to come straight into committee, and I do apologize if I have missed bits of paper or whatever, I've gathered up everything I could, but that might well be one of the things that I've left behind.
We accept that Councillor Kurtz would be honourable in these matters, do we accept Councillor Tiffany as her substitute.
Yes
They're not saying a lot are they?
I had erm I was going to be representative of this committee at a erm safety seminar for three days at the beginning of this week that I wasn't able to go to, and Councillor Kurtz has very kindly gone in my place, which is why she is not able to come to this meeting.
Ah, well in that case 
We do appreciate that explanation.
No, I think sometimes it's forgotten not all that many, you know, these remarks about us not being there.
There's not many of you!
Only three that can be there and 
We're quite happy that there's not many of you Anne!
Okay, so we accept that Councillor Tiffany is now substituting Councillor Kurtz and may now take her full part in the meeting.
Can I just ask your permission for our proceedings this afternoon to be tape recorded by Caroline, and I've forgotten where you come from, Caroline?
From the University Press, from Oxford University Press.
From the Oxford University Press.
Will you need to know why she needs to tape record?
Thought you might!
Yes.
Would you like to tell us, Caroline?
Yes, it's for the dictionary project, we're doing a, erm we're trying to build up a database at the moment of transcribed spoken language.
We're happy to take part in that!
Could we have that repeated, please, I didn't hear it.
She's of the dictionary project that's looking at transcribed spoken language.
Oh, we'll have to be careful, then, won't we!
You may have to be careful.
Perhaps you ought to tell her that John Patten is no longer with the environmental health.
He is in fact.
Is he still there?
Haven't seen him for about two weeks.
So we're all happy about that?
Approved duties.
You'll probably need help filling round here.
I was going to say, I have no idea, unless there's, if they're on the agenda, I'll pick them up and see, if there's anything else, you'll have tell me about it I'm afraid, chair.
I'm not immediately aware of anything else, but members, please rack your brains as we go through, Diana?
You gave us, you gave us some dates on page three, item one hundred and twenty, thirteenth and fourteenth of December.
I believe we've taken a decision on that for the health conference, last time round.
I've got one on page eighty-one, but we'll come to it on pollution control.
They're are some others too, chair, on the seminars and conferences we've listed.
We can do on the way through, okay.
I think there is no urgent business.
erm Well, as I understand it there is a report on the authorization of officers, which is urgent business.
Ah, that's right, sorry 
Yes, chair, and I don't have copies and, you do?
Well, I have some, I thought they'd gone round, but this is, erm sorry 
Chair, it was one officer whom we've got on staff at the moment  Karen Wheeler who's away nursing her new baby, and it's to authorize that officer to carry out certain roles under the health and safety 
Can you circulate that, the committee is accustomed to seeing it.
I don't think it should cause you any problems, but it is something that's come on late erm as a result of maternity cover.
Right.
Ian Waterhouse is with us, probably wondering how on earth these meetings get off the ground at all.
Ian, you're the community services manager.
We have a paper from you on, can we settle down a bit.
We have a paper from you on page eleven.
Can I ask you to limit yourself to some five minutes.
I apologize for that, that, but we have a very heavy agenda, and members start falling asleep around five, and if people have questions or comments, perhaps they .
Welcome to our committee, and we hope we'll be working together in the future.
Thank you, yes, erm thank you very much for inviting me to attend to those meetings and giving me the opportunity to meet you all.
Having worked for a number of years now in community health services, previously erm in Yorkshire, in fact I've only been down in Oxford about four or five months, I've learnt how important it is in fact to make good working contacts with members and officers of other organizations, and particularly of local authority organizations.
I'm therefore doubly grateful to you for giving me the chance to meet you today, and I hope that some of the contacts I might make today will stand me in good stead in the job that I'm doing in Oxford over the next year or so.
I have sent round a briefing paper, and rather than go right through that, what I'd just like to do is to highlight two or three things about myself and about the post that I now hold, and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have during the next two or three minutes.
Firstly, just to set my own context, I've been in the health service now for just over twenty year.
I went into the service in nineteen seventy as a national trainee, and I'm therefore coming from the administrative branch of the service.
I'm not a qualified nurse, or a health care professional.
I'm an administrator by background, and I think that's interesting, because one of the things that we are trying to do in the health service is to open up our management posts to people of all professions, and to recognise that management is not the prerogative of any particular group, but that we're looking for the right people to manage our services from wherever they might come, and I'm one of three people who has a responsibility to the senior manager in the community at the top, for the managing on a day-to-day basis the health services in Oxfordshire.
Of those two colleagues, interestingly enough, one is a health visitor by background, the other is a nurse, but someone who practised or hasn't practised, but as a district health community planner for a number of years.
So you can see that we have quite a mixture of people in terms of our backgrounds professionally.
The purpose of general management is to try and ensure that in the city that we are getting the best value we can from the health resources that are in the city, and I have the authority now, and the responsibility to spend the budget that I've had allocated from the Oxfordshire Health Authority, by Gerald Simon who's the general manager.
So a big change in the way that we are arranged has actually come about through the general management structure, and we're hoping that this will give us more room, if you like  to start looking at priorities, and to move the budget around in accordance with our feelings about those priorities.
In that task I am assisted by a team of six managers, all of whom are professional nurses and district nurses or health visitors and they of course are there to advise me on professional issues, and to share with me the management task of using the resources of Oxford City in the way that we feel is best appropriate, and in doing that, I think one of the important things for us to do, I don't think we do it quite as well as we should, is to work more closely with the local council, and to look really at what the needs of our local communities are for health, and to try and make sure that the feelings that might well be expressed by individuals, either individually, or through caring associations, or through other statutory agencies, or through voluntary health organisations, are actually given a chance to be there, and to influence our, that official policy and constituents , and to, to influence the planning process.
I've made a note of a potting of that briefing paper to you.
I personally see this is as one of my major objectives over the next year or so, and in a sense it makes me trebly grateful to be here today, because I hope some of the contacts I might make today will enable me to work alongside you in what might be called even local Berkshire band, and to try and get more a multiplicity of views from different organisations channelled through our own value objectives.
And it is the exciting part of my job is to make these links work, start to build on them, and over our links in the city on the environmental and  group with Tony Benn , that's that's doing a very good job, he is a platform for this, for each other, but I think there's a lot more we can do locally erm within the city to build those links, and to work together for better answers for the city, and I hope that, on a practical level, one of the things that interested me was your grants team for local organisations, and I would like to think  myself here today, we might look at the health authority, and try to join with them to make some erm practical contribution, particularly to those many carers, and groups of people who have problems, and we're not all just professionals best able to put over during our normal nine-to-five or eight-to-eight days, we  we can.
There's a lot we can do, I think, to help the community in a wider sense, and I see that as one of the key elements of my work, to try and make that work.
And I'm not too concerned with the day-to-day management of individual professionals, I've got a team to help me do that.
What concerns me is looking at the  and trying to forge new creative links with other organisations, statutory and voluntary, in the best health interests of Oxfordshire residents.
That I think is my main concern, with a request in a sense to you for supporting that over the next year or so, because I'll be trying to perhaps get invited to the meetings, and perhaps we'll be inviting officers from the authority to join me in looking at ways of building up that local context in planning to get that into our formal planning systems.
That will be my key message, and the other thing I'd like to emphasise today, and I'd be very grateful for some sort of early response to that.
I have discussed it with Dorothy Tomkin I think we have a genuine desire to move to a more authority-based planning system, erm, we haven't got the methods of doing that yet, and I turn to C B S and to local authority and to the traditional carers for them to join us in that.
So thank you for giving me the chance to, to air that view.
There are means to get a response and I'm grateful to take the temperature of the water.
Right.
The temperature of the water will inevitably be variably, and I'm sure we certainly welcome, lots of people will welcome your philosophical position.
I would say just two things; the one on the rates scheme, we certainly as a health committee distribute fifteen thousand pounds a year and treat these as important pledge by work.
We can't deliberately do not maintain those voluntary groups which we feel are appropriately and better funded by the health authority.
The health authority has for years not shown any signs of so doing, I have to say.
I don't want to be cynical at this stage, but years of experience that show that the health authority has no intention of doing that.
And the other thing to say to from me is yes, we would love a multiplicity of views to go to the District Health Authority, I and my predecessor Betty Stanford, who were District Council Members on that health authority, we were there and able to listen to and able to contribute to the debate, the Government White Paper has taken us off, so that is not a good start in terms of how you involve the city and the district with the policy decisions of the health authority.
So that's my bit of bad news.
I can see Arthur, Betty and Liz.
Chairman, may I first of all declare an interest in this.
erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the  visit erm persons over seventy-five.
Now, what are you doing to ensure that erm that this is carried out because a lot of elderly, they will not go to the doctor, but erm the doctor I believe has got to go and see them.
Now, what are you doing to really see this is getting off the ground?
Well, I 
Ian, can I ask you to save the questions and respond at the end, otherwise you'll find the discussion takes much longer, is that alright?
Although that may not be appropriate  view of that, but, Betty?
I was going to raise the very question you raised.
There we were as representatives of this city, people who are in contact with erm people who have got problems, we were 
Can you press your button, Betty?
in my view thrown off without any reasonable excuse, because I felt that I could bring a lot of expertise to the health authority.
They may not have thought of it as expertise, but when people said to me a particular ward is dirty, I went and looked at it, and in a very short time, within about ten minutes, that ward had got a massive clean-up team in there, that's the sort of thing that I felt was useful.
That being said, I mean, you've lost now local, local erm expertise there.
What I want to ask is, firstly, who are you funded by, and these teams, I note erm paragraphs three erm these nurses and so on, are they existing staff, or is this a new team, erm management team which has been set up at yet more expense to the health authority?
So, basically, I want to know are they taken from erm a team which is already in the health service, or are they new posts funded, and funded by whom, bearing in mind the constant complaints we get from the health authority about lack of funds?
Thank you, Betty.
Liz?
Thank you.
I'm finding myself somewhat confused, I mean, I was interested that Ian had mentioned the practical voluntary services as one of the groups that he would wish to work with.
I think that recently we seem to have had such, so many changes in the health authority, so many different peoples in the post who all seem to be doing the same sort of thing, who've got the Family Health Services Authority set up, but it would seem to me that some of the things that are on this piece of paper are things that I understood were being done by the Family Health Services Authority.
We have a joint planning officer, and we've got quite a lot of joint erm of joint planning going on between the voluntary sector and the Health Authority and the Social Services.
We've got a whole erm, a whole erm organisation  that in fact the Council for Voluntary Service only this week made an appointment with a very, very, very, very small amount of money that's been made available on a very, very part-time basis, to actually assist with that, with the planning that's going on in the voluntary sector.
And I think that we're constantly hearing about new people, new systems of working.
erm New people who are being put in posts to liaise and to do this, that and the other, with a shrinking voluntary sector.
With a voluntary sector that is erm constantly needing small amounts of resource in order to deliver an enormous amount of service to vulnerable people.
And I think that the time will come some point, when the voluntary sector will say, ‘Well, we actually don't have time to talk erm to carry on talking about what we're doing and how we're doing it.
We actually much prefer to get on with what we're there to do, and to, to offer services, to find, to find ways of supporting vulnerable people.
So, I think my questions are, one, where does this post fit in the Family Health Services Authority?
Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?,
Three, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority.
Thank you very much, Liz.
We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian.
I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else.
I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused.
I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning.
There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning.
And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done.
In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service.
erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated.
I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it.
So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do.
erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help.
So those are my few comments, thank you.
Thank you Anne.
Nonnie?
As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together?
Yes, Okay?
Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can?
Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages.
Yes, but at what level?
Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised?
I don't know.
You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on?
The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues  I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear.
Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the  to say.
I'm not part of the  organisation.
They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives.
I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked.
In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like .
In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense.
I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities.
And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on.
So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that.
I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you .
Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past.
mhm
I'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were.
Well, no, but I 
But of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the 
Yes, I get that, yes 
Ian, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again.
Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out.
I'm sure of it.
Thank you very much indeed.
Bye
Thanks, bye bye.
You can stay of course!
Don't blame you!
Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business.
Do you all have sight of that?
It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para.
2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you.
Are you agreed?
Agreed.
So that we can get on with this work.
Thank you very much indeed.
On to item six and seven.
You'll remember we do this on an annual basis.
It's very efficiently organised for us to do.
We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers.
Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford.
Thanks, Chair.
Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair.
This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,
She does?
She's one of the members you can come to.
So Katherine can answer the details on the report.
Right.
Welcome, Katherine.
I didn't realize that's who you are.
I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes!
So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage?
I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford.
Right
That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention.
So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag.
Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford.
Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up.
Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City.
Yes.
That's tended to be our line.
They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question.
Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications.
I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that.
So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits?
That doesn't alter that position, Katherine?
No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one.
Quite.
Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross?
We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with.
erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire?
Yes, they've got a farm in Burford.
Ahh.
Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why?
Graham?
I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days.
I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street.
Yes, these are street collections.
That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing.
And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year.
Okay, Betty?
I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities.
And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year.
It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one 
Thirty-one.
Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable.
Well, of course, there's flag days as well .
Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds.
Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities.
Would that suit you for the time being, Graham?
I think so, It made me feel that some actually seem to be quite keen to have suburban or mid-week, even though they've had city centre ones in the past.
Some clearly want to switch to city centre.
But I did think that it might just ease the pressure on Saturdays, because, following what erm Betty has said, in fact, as I make it it's forty-five Saturdays out of fifty-two, and bearing in mind Bank Holiday weekend, Christmas and that sort of thing, it's virtually every Saturday in the city centre there is a collection.
Now that's fine, but I know some people who are in the city centre every, on Saturday, feel very guilty if they're not constantly giving, and I do think we want to get that balance.
Clearly we want to support the charities, and the organisations but erm.
I was just going to make a quick comment if I may on Oxfam, because I noticed that they're down for the street collections and for the flag day, now next year's their fiftieth anniversary, so I think it's quite appropriate next year, but I do, my own view is, that we will get, we ought to get one comprehensive list of all these organisations, for both the street collections and the flag days, with an indication in the column of whether it's flag day they've gone for or a street collection, so that we can identify that sort of situation.
Right, I mean, that seems quite sensible actually.
I would just like to point out that suburban and mid-week flag day erm street collections alternate with the city centre the following year.
That was committee decision a number of years ago.
Right, Anne.
I think there does come a point when there is resistance.
I mean, we all know that having to shake tins, the number of people who go past by on the other side, and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers, and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many.
So what I thought was that it was quite important to look at all these organisations that do seem to me really to have nothing to do with Oxford or Oxfordshire, and that we should be very careful.
Now, if we are going to, for instance, allow I mean there's one organisation, number five, which says it's a national, although it's called Cherwell Round Table, which says it's just a national body raising funds for numerous charities.
Now, if we're going to allow an organisation like that, have we no erm chance to say that after they've had their collection, we should like to have some indication of what percentage went to Oxford, so that when they apply again, we can at least know whether this is actually a genuine local organisation or national.
And a lot of these organisations, it's very difficult, because there are many that a lot of people are in favour of, like, well, take King George's Fund for Sailors and so on , but how do we know, I mean, there might be two people they might help in Oxford over the course of the year.
I do think it's a difficult one, but I do feel there is a limit to the number, and therefore we should be careful that the ones we agree to are the ones that interest local people.
Right.
I think we certainly agree with you in terms of locality, and it's open to you at any time, I would have thought, to be in touch with Katherine, and say, ‘Would you follow up on x or y’.
I think if the committee did that then we'd be back to what five or six years ago, when a whole afternoon was spent on that and I wouldn't commend that to you, but can we perhaps have a word with the officers at a later stage, take it on board what both Graham and Anne have been saying, and obviously not trying to do that in a meeting like this but try to prepare for it a month before-hand.
Is that reasonable at this stage?
Yes
so we can get progress?
Chair, could I make, could I suggest maybe that in future when you ask organisations  you make it harder for getting a license for street collection, that you tell them that you'll want to know exactly the proportions, but I mean put it back on to them, rather than be you having to bother to it in the future.
Right, is that not done?
It is to a degree, on the application form that each charity receives, it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area, but not as a percentage.
I think that, more, not sort of say a general question like that, but say that after the collection has happened that you want returns for the number of people in Oxford that have benefited from the number of groups in Oxford that have benefited.
I mean, I think a lot of national organisations that are giving, I trust that are giving money to people actually do want to know that sort of detail about where the money is going, because, if I go through this, I mean, I would have to say that I should imagine that a very small percentage of the money that has been collected on these flag days will actually get back into Oxfordshire.
I mean, my knowledge of the organisations that are there tells me that.
I mean there's organisations like Oxrad that clearly, the money will only be spent in Oxford city.
And the bit about it is that there may well be other small organisations that might, erm be better, erm I mean, have, might benefit people more in Oxford city, or in Oxfordshire, aren't getting in because 
No, that's not the case, it's open to them to apply in any event.
I know, but what I mean is that when they see the city centre, the people who are walking up and down the city centre, they see all the national charities, they don't necessarily feel that they're organised in the same way and therefore that they should be participating, and the whole palaver of getting a licence and applying is actually quite difficult, it's not a simple, it's not something, we get numerous telephone calls in the office saying ‘Well can I go out next Saturday and rattle a tin for such-and-such’, and you say ‘Well, you can't’, and it's left much too late, so that people don't know about the way you get licenses to rattle tins in city centre.
Don't know about the issues to do with house-to-house collection.
Are we getting, erm collecting erm in the shopping centres.
They just don't actually have that information, a lot of small local groups, and I think maybe the C B S could work with the Engineers department in future years and try to get to those groups, because I'm sure a lot of them, actually if they were given the opportunity in time to get in, that, that you might have a lot of people applying for flag and whatever than you do now.
Well, by all means, let's do that, and  has been represented in committee for some time, we have responsibility for licenses for some time, and if there isn't a dialogue now, then there'll be a good reason why there isn't, and I, I take what you say, Liz.
But certainly, if we have something like fifty applications, then we'd be into a much more complex procedure.
We can see why we don't, and I'm not clear about the reasons why we don't, but there you are, Michael.
Chair, another query about a couple of the comments made just now, about priority being given to organisations which disclaim their proceeds in Oxford or Oxfordshire.
I had a cheque for some thirteen hundred pounds raised by the local branch of National body, a body like Round Table, although it wasn't Round Table, it was another body like that, and that will buy thirteen houses in Everland in Southern India.
Well, not a single penny will be spent in Oxford or Oxfordshire.
Now, am I to take it that sort of appeal will have a very low priority, I mean, how about Oxfam for example?
Oxfam doesn't have a low priority, clearly, erm there are, certainly we have an S.O fifty-three procedure for disasters and so forth.
But there isn't a direct slot, Michael, you're right, for a project such as the one you've just described.
I mean, maybe what I'm hearing from the committee is that we take it back and look at the criteria and the ground rules.
I just would suggest that we don't do it in this committee.
But what we certainly can do is take note of what you've said, and ensure that we get it together for you to be consulted before we take decisions next year.
Graham, you've had two bites, and I really 
I was only going to agree with you actually, and I was just going to back-up what Michael said, and say that obviously we've got people like Amnesty International, and I know it's a very hard-working local branch, but obviously, the money it's raised is going to benefit people overseas.
Hopefully so, hopefully we haven't got people within the city of Oxford that need Amnesty's help!
Right, can I leave you then to the recommendations on page sixteen, notwithstanding all of the suggestions and comments that have been made, that we this year grant twenty-one Saturday City Centre permits, and the officers are clear twenty-one and not twenty-three, that we grant eleven City Centre, mid-week and suburban permits, and do you note that whoever is unsuccessful in obtaining Saturday City Centre permit will be granted one of those and given priority.
Yes?
Will you agree to grant three band collection permits, which you've done before, which are usually great fun, I must say.
And D is part of what Michael is saying, it gives the chair, vice-chair, opposition liaison member the discretion to allow for usually natural disasters, and we would obviously want that discretion with your support.
There's one final thing, and that is on page fifteen at the bottom, it's a list of organisations which were given permits for St Michael the Northgate.
And I'm not quite sure why Age Concern, which has had this for I think at least twenty years for their Christmas Carols, which is not included.
But I don't, the fact that they're not included does not mean that they can't have it, because that would be disastrous, because they do rely on that 
It doesn't, they just haven't requested it this year.
Well, I mean, that is absolutely nonsense, it's tradition, I'm sure they'll have it.
Can you take that up with Age Concern, Anne?
There's a limit as to how much we can do for half the people in this committee are members 
But you see it's inaccurate anyway, because it's five two during nineteen ninety  five, and they had it 
This year
They did for last year.
I mean, it's for Christmas this year that we want it.
Well, can you get them together with Katherine fairly rapidly, is that a good idea?
I mean, there's enabling and enabling, isn't there for heaven's sake.
Chair, on the recommendations erm on item D, I'm a bit unhappy about the use of the term ‘natural’ disasters, because I believe that many of the disasters that people in Oxford are actually giving money for are man made disasters, particularly matters of international economics and the unfair burden, erm unfair distribution of wealth which places a whole sector of the world in poverty, and I think, you know, you do get a magnificent response from people in Oxford to these charities, and we must be aware that there are a whole number of greater issues involved, and while I hear what you're saying earlier on about you can't take on the problems of the whole world, I think when people are actually giving money to charities for example, like Oxfam, they are often unaware of these issues, and we do have a wider role in making the, joining with organisations like Oxfam in spreading public awareness on these issues.
Right, I agree with that, and I think that we'll simply leave out the word ‘natural’ in future, won't we.
Have we agreed that as a committee?
Indeed, we have all agreed, I take it the recommendations under eight one in order that we can make progress.
Which left the word in?
So that we can report back, a month before decision time next time round?
Are you happy with that?
Item seven then is on page twenty-seven.
This is flag day, which essentially means house-to-house.
Is there anything you want to say about that, Katherine at this stage?
No, it's quite straightforward.
Right, the only comment I have is members will remember that we got slapped in council last year because we issued a permit to LIFE for a flag day application.
I sat down with LIFE and worked through their philosophy, erm in line with our own as it were, and they agreed, and I would ask them to agree this year that any paperwork or any leaflets they distribute make it very clear that a choice remains for a woman in terms of whether or not she should have an abortion, because LIFE is fairly, yes, Michael?
Did you check their tenancy agreement, because it was a pretty Machiavellian, Dickensian tenancy agreement, if you're found smoking in bed for example, you were out the next morning, those sort of things, and I think you really ought to look at that very carefully.
We certainly did last year, there's no reason why we can't monitor it again, so they know we are watching them quite carefully.
That might have been for very good environmental and health reasons.
Yes, I should hope so.
I think I would commend LIFE to you, but it will be with the same conditions and terms as we did last year, with which they did comply.
Are there other questions of queries on flag days or are you happy to approve them as they stand.
That's on page twenty-seven, six one, twenty four flag day permits to be approved, and we allow the officer to decide how they will best be distributed across the city.
Are you happy with that?
And then on six two, do you wish to grant a permit to allow a flag day to take place on one or two days during nineteen ninety-one, for the Royal British Legion?
Can I have someone move something on that, please?
Yes, I'd move that erm they'd be granted two days.
I'll second that.
And you'll second that, cross-party approach to this, are you all agreed?
Thank you very much indeed.
Can I ask, I know we've got Amanda Root here, who's going to help us in the Health Action Area Report, I also know that she has an ailing child, can we then take the item eleven, health action areas now on page fifty-eight, so that we can let Amanda go back to her commitments.
The joint report from Amanda and Phil.
Amanda, do you want to kick off on this?
Thank you chair, erm many of you will perhaps know that the health authority did some pioneering work looking at different standard mortality ratios in different wards in Oxfordshire, and came up with some rather disturbing evidence that some of the wards had significantly higher incidents of death for people primarily in the forty-five to sixty-four age range than others, and Phil and myself wish to continue that work by targeting those wards with a range of measures designed to alleviate some of those health inequalities.
And in this report, we've just outlined a very preliminary start to what we're doing.
We'd obviously, we'd like to get the agreement of this committee to continue that work and to take it up to the various bodies  and consultation.
And, erm to develop it there's a timetable in the appendices about the progress we envisage making.
We'd like to confirm by the end of this year which wards we're targeting and how we're targeting them, which range of erm measures that we're going to undertake.
is that we've been involved in health strategy for the past over five years.
The ultimate test of any health in the city strategy is what we do about the health divide.
We have to do something about the equity target.
And that's extremely difficult to do something about the equity target, since National policy, the distribution of income, housing policy, all the things that we tackle on this committee and committees of the council have a very significant effect on the health of the people who live in the city, and it's not in our control.
Nevertheless, it's our belief that through health promotion programmes which involve cooperation with communities themselves, that we can in fact do as much as we possibly can do to actually alleviate some of the erm differences in health status.
So our belief is that erm with the relationship we've been able to build up in this city, with confrontation and community participation, with the targeting of the small resources that we do have, as a council in collaboration with the other, the resources of the other bodies, that we can in fact do something.
So I'll do this and I think Amanda would agree with this that this is the ultimate test that will help us in establishing can we actually do something about target one of the World Health Organisation, which is to narrow the health divide.
That's out test.
I would also add to that that I think such work would help us in terms of targeting more effectively the existing resources we have in terms of service delivery.
Are there any questions?
Sheila?
Chair, I'd like to ask Amanda, I did  St Clements and Petersfield .
Is there any possibility of, in the near future of doing a council estate, like Barton or Blackbird Leys?
erm Yes, certainly, I, I would suggest East and St Clements because they have got quite high ethnic populations, and we can perhaps be hoping to start there, because Environmental Health's already worked there, targeting some of the multi-occupation properties, so they've got a very high proportion of black people living there, which means that they're also quite important in the sense of deprivation, but, I mean, we are also very conscious that we should be working on a council estate, and what we, what I would like to do is to simultaneously be starting working in erm a particular sets of communities, is to be given work in consultation in other wards, so that you know, six months down the line before .
But thanks for the point, and I mean, I'll make a note of that and take it up to the health authority.
Betty and then Ruth.
I'm a little surprised, chair, I could ask Amanda, but erm, Iffley is erm on the list, bearing in mind, recalling the erm point figures, where Iffley are if I recall correct was fairly well down on the league table, and Marston was something like erm six or some place.
erm What connection is there between unemployment and deprivation?
Thank you.
erm I agree, and I actually think these figures are relatively crude, but I mean, there is, clearly there are correlations between low income, which most I mean unemployed people have of course got, and ill health.
But certainly, something like Iffley's relatively surprising, it could well be, it might be because there's quite a high proportion of retired people or something, so the figures are actually distorted.
erm What, what we're hoping is that erm the university's undertaking some research to actually look at the links between very small geographic areas, postcode in fact, and ill health.
So when that research becomes available, we'll actually be able to be much, much more specific about where we're targeting, because I agree it's, you know, some of these are somewhat surprising.
Nonnie
Yes, in one five, erm they're practising notes from Eynsham it does happen to be in Cherwell ward and not North ward, erm there is a booklet out about health and housing in Cutteslowe, and I wondered what the connection between, you know, not being on this committee, but these health action areas, and what in fact is happening in housing, because the director did assure me that other wards were going to be treated to the same erm treatment.
So I don't know whether that is what's referred to?
Hang on, can I just check out your question, certainly we've taken the Cutteslowe health and housing audit to this committee, and so has housing 
Yes, yes, but that's not going to be the only one, as I understand it.
That was an external one in fact 
Yes, is that's what's being referred to erm by the university work, because I think it's 
It isn't actually
Is that so?
It isn't.
The other question I've got is presumably all this is still being done within what we've got in the budget, or is it, are there going to be extra bids?
You know the answer to that question, Non, there's going to be no extra bids.
No extra bids.
This particular section's taken some slices already, so we'd better watch what we say to them.
They're doing it within their own time and resources, but it does seem to me to be a very appropriate area for  Michael?
Thank you
It's certainly will be difficult, Chair, but in answer to Mrs Tidley, what's happening to our housing, the answer is we've stopped building it.
Government policy we don't build any housing, and therefore we've got five thousand on the waiting list, and that's why health is a major problem for a lot of people in this city, because we're not building any houses, she knows that, and she and her party do nothing about it.
We're doing an awful lot in 
Thank you, Gerald.
Yes, well, I particularly welcome this erm concentration on areas, I think it's an excellent idea, particularly in relation to housing, I think what we will find interesting is that a whole number of Oxford citizens, perhaps indeed from Barton, Blackbird Leys, Marston originally, who are badly housed in these areas and waiting in the most appalling accommodation for the opportunity of a council home.
And I'm sure that this report on the health action area is going to show some fairly, erm give us some fairly staggering erm revelations about about the health of Oxford citizens that's going to surprise people at large when they find out how badly people have fared over the past ten years when we've had the Tories in office who've really done their very, very best to make the health divide of this country in a very poor state.
Hear, hear
Thank you, Anne
Sorry I was going to go down to get an authorization from Age Concern, I missed the first bit, but erm if resources are allowed for this work, would it not be better to aim them at priority areas, and not wards, I mean, in other words, to put it to the areas that needed most.
I mean a ward is going to be seen as rather a big area, when within wards there are priority areas.
That was really my point.
I don't think I'll bother to answer the remarks that others need to say of course tremendous resources have gone into the health service over the past few years, but I think whatever government is in power, it will never be enough for all the new developments in the health service, and that is always the trouble, whoever would be there would find it difficult.
erm Your comment on wards, I think this is a way of the officers giving us something to work on and take a decision on.
Once they have a decision to work, then I would doubt very much actually they're going to be into every corner of St Clements and East, or ignoring council estates altogether.
We have to allow them to take some decisions within our decision, I think, but I'm sure they'll take your point anyway.
Diana, and then we ought to come to a decision.
Yes, I'm sure, I mean we obviously all appreciate the fact that within wards there's an area of deprivation and an area that isn't deprived.
I mean, many, many wards, but that doesn't mean that we should therefore ignore a ward because it's got an area that is not deprived, you've got the, I think that by choosing East and St Clements as areas, that they seem then quite sensible areas to start with, nice central, fairly central location.
I was going to say, when it comes to paragraph five, do you erm suggest that you actually think in terms of church organisations, they're not mentioned, and I look forward in in paragraph seven one to the seminar, the working seminar that's going to be in the near future, and I hope that we'll soon get a date, so that we can get it in our very busy diaries, in the hope that we can come along and learn more about this.
Thanks very much, Diana.
Could we add mosques as well to the churches, please?
I'm sorry, I should have said all religious groups.
All religious groups !
Can we come to a decision there please.
Yes, just on the sub-ward level, of course there's really, there's a lot more investigations to go into targeting the resources, just I mean to target them in a city by having these standard mortality ratios for wards, but they're all below ward level, and target the specific areas.
erm That's one point, the other point is of course, we have already targeted of course in working with the groups that we've defined as erm ones whose health status is at risk in effect, so this is a supplement, this is actually translating those targets we have already defined into a locality planning exercise.
So we're testing, those priorities are still holding for us that but we're applying them to the localities.
Thanks very much.
Can I direct you then to page sixty-one, recommendations in paragraph eight.
You're asked to support the general move, that we have set out from this report, and you're asked to agree to St Clements and East Ward, and I think we've heard Mandy and Phil acknowledge that there may well be a case for looking at an area of council housing, which we will leave them to do, and also to approve the set of objectives, which I particularly welcome, on page sixty-two and sixty-three, which will amount to a work programme, which I would have thought we were all very pleased to see.
Can we endorse that, and ask the officers to come back to us and keep us in touch with their work.
Are you agreed?
Thanks very much indeed, thank you both, and I .
We need to move somewhat quickly, and I am reminded that, I did see Caroline come in, but we have two people who've come in connection with item fifteen, Community Concerns in East Oxford, are you agreed that we take that now, so that they can 
I think it ties in very well with the item we've just discussed.
Thank you, Graham.
Item fifteen, and Shereen has just arrived as well.
Caroline and your visitor, would you like to join us at the table, if you want to join in.
So we're turning to page seventy-five.
The paper is in fact written by Shereen.
I don't want you to think, Caroline that we are acquitting you rapidly, I will try to acquit you rapidly, but I am also delivering what you've come for.
Well, thank you, chair, for inviting me here.
erm do you want me to speak to this 
Please do.
Caroline Morrell, from OCADU, do you want to press your button, Caroline, so that everybody will  please sit down normally and naturally, and maybe moved a bit closer to you, they'll pick up what you're saying.
erm But I raised this at the alcohol forum, because erm sometime this summer I had a phone call from Mr Bailey here, who is a resident of East Oxford, to express his concern about various problems erm in East Oxford, problems that were posed to residents there.
erm I think in fact it would be better to ask Mr Bailey to explain what his concerns were erm I'd just like to say first although initially it revolves around problems of drinking, I'm looking at other issues of East Oxford, in that recently there's been a great deal of concern about glue sniffing in sections there, and there have been various letters from residents in the local newspapers, and I think there's a general level of problem for people living in East Oxford, and it's not just that the people there want the streets cleaned up or whatever, they want something constructive and helpful to be done for people.
So 
Welcome, would you like to take two or three minutes to talk to us about your concerns.
Right.
I should say first how this matter arose.
It arose because some neighbours in my street effectively started behaving which was totally antisocial.
There was a small group of young people who, as it happens were also associated with the bed-and-breakfast on Iffley Road, erm and several of them had moved between this house and the bed-and-breakfast.
Their activities ranged throughout the day and night and reached a peak of basically making a noise nuisance of themselves, there were other troubles which I will mention later, in which they would be playing two or three different sound systems, and at its worst, a full drum set in the early hours of the morning, obviously keeping their near neighbours not only awake but in a state of some anxiety.
I live directly opposite to them, and there were two of their neighbours who effectively unable to carry on a normal life throughout most of the time that they were there.
This was taking place on five or six nights until early mornings a week for several hours.
Eventually a noise abatement notice was served on them, and erm immediately after that the landlord offered them a hundred pounds to leave, and they left.
He did that because they had not only annoying his neighbours, sorry, their neighbours, because he had once been one of our neighbours, but also they had damaged his house, and they had already cost him probably about two hundred pounds in repair bills until the house itself, broken doors, window erm the wall, and bit of the roof and so on, and there was every reason to believe that this would just carry on.
Now, erm I think I should make clear that I have some personal feelings on this, and I just want to say something very briefly about my neighbours, something I actually don't agree with .
erm There is a general concern I think with multiple occupancy that there's, a whole way of life of East Oxford is changing, and not for the better, and indeed I was part of this when I moved into the area ten years ago.
erm And the, a lot of this was not specific to drug or alcohol abuse but simply to multiple occupancy.
And we've now reached a situation in which there's something over twenty percent of our streets is multiple occupation, erm and this is noise and other activities in relation to that are the things that cause the sort of low level of concern, and this was just the peak on top of that of major aggravation.
erm I think there are one or two of the elderly tenants in particular who felt really very anxious about activities at night time, and they're going to have their property stolen, or things thrown at their house.
I mean these people, there's things like throwing broken milk bottles, throwing milk bottles into peoples yards, removing bicycles, picking up my bicycle, as it happens, and throwing it down several times, erm going down the streets playing a sound system full volume at two o'clock in the morning, which generally left people feeling they didn't know what was happening.
This was only part of a general sort of pattern as it were, where people were beginning to impinge on their lives, there was another well-known local alcoholic  there who was knocking on doors trying to get money off people, and there's several elderly people who gave this woman money, because they were frightened that if they didn't something would happen to them.
So I think I can  express some of my neighbours concerns, unless, particularly, not particularly worried about those, but there is a general feeling that things are getting worse, and that they're not safe in their own homes, among the more elderly.
erm And obviously a few people don't like the sight of people on the Cowley, the Cowley Hospital site, and things like that.
This doesn't concern me.
I do feel I'd like to say one point about the people who were in this house, that it's quite clear, all of them I believe were under care of the social services, erm and I don't know enough about their history to say whether they, where they've been before, whether they've been in some half-way house, or just been thrown out of some mental institution.
I'm virtually certain that the woman from whom we had most of the aggravation had been.
She was clearly mentally disturbed, and the reason that I got in touch with the legal project was to see if there's anything that could be done by them to start giving her some way of getting in touch, getting to solve her problem.
Obviously this was done out of self interest, but I really, the woman was in real pain.
She was an extremely angry, very bitter woman, who was determined to get everybody around her as angry as she could, and she succeeded, and I don't know where she's moved now, but I'm sure she will go on and do the same thing, and frankly, I despair of anything being done unless there is some provision made for people such as herself, and one of her friends in particular.
That's really what I'd like to say.
Thank you very much indeed, I think that's fairly fair, but none-the-less honest way of setting out your feelings.
This is quite a specific issue, and I'm not sure that this committee on this day is in the best position to discuss it in detail.
Obviously I'll take your advice on that.
I do think as far as placing people in houses in multi-occupation, we acknowledge that.
How is it done, by whom, who thinks about it, is it planned, is there support, and for that reason we are arranging a meeting, Frank, together with the Health Authority with all those agencies who do place people, sometimes quite sick people as you rightly point out.
So that is certainly on line.
Now, I know that what Shereen asks us to do, and I'm sure Caroline as well, is to organise a multi-agency meeting.
We've done this on the proposed East Oxford Education centre.
I think we can very usefully do this, and iron our way to this.
What we need from you is really a specific proposal about the kinds of groups and individuals that you want us to sit down with.
You can either do that now, or we can agree in principle that we will take this up.
Perhaps chair, vice chair, and opposition liaison member if you feel that's suitable.
And call such a meeting.
I think it will a long way, but you're quite to draw it to us, and to ask us to set out on that road.
Michael?
Yes, chair.
What sort of people would you involve in this meeting.
I mean there's a lot of voluntary organisations who are working in this field, I don't know how you would just make sure you got them all.
The resources are pitifully small.
I mean, I'm involved in doing some statistics for Windmill House, the probation service, and we've found that the sixteen-to-eighteen-year-old provision in the city is very, very small.
I'm sure it's the same for many of the other groups who've got problems.
But, erm I hope you involve all those sort of organisations in your discussions.
I would imagine that Shereen would apply the same kind of pattern as you did to the de-toxification centre meeting, Shereen, and I felt that there were a great many people there, a great many interested, including the voluntary interest.
Betty?
Well, of course, chair, a lot of these problems are arising out of the so-called ‘care in community’.
I was hoping we'd avoid the political discussion, Betty.
Well, you know, I mean.
We've a job to do here.
Well, you know me, I don't normally become political, but let's face it, this is one of the direct results of throwing the money to the community without any after care, and I was particularly concerned, with my other hat on, only last week, that a young man told us his address was now the night shelter.
Now, because his time at the Bridge had ended, he had nowhere else to go, except to the Nightshelter.
Now, I thought that was quite inappropriate for a young man like him, who had nowhere else to go, so there are many, many multiple problems for people like this in this city, and anything we can do would be appreciated, but I really don't know where we would stop, there are so many problems.
I would ask members to be brief, otherwise we shall actually lose matters off this agenda today.
Liz, and then Patrick.
Chair, can I suggest that some of the people who are actually involved in this are actually asked themselves rather than agencies that might be working with them, because I think that, that most of the, the sort of people we're talking about are actually very sensitive.
And they know about what's happening to them, and know that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter about what their behaviour is, it doesn't matter about what happens to them, because nobody cares.
And I think it's very, very important that they're involved.
Through the Princes' Trust in the month we actually give grants to something like twenty people, just to get them off the street, because there was nowhere else they could turn to.
And I think that there's a massive problem that needs to be addressed, and I think we should involve those people themselves, also in looking at what the issues are, it's all very well for people to decide, workers to think that they know what the issues are.
I very often think that that's not the case.
Yes, I think we'd all agree with that.
Patrick?
Thanks, erm the report refers to East Oxford, which is of course for two wards, East and St Clement's, but the problem extends city-wide, and I think the solution should be seen as a city-wide solution.
Yes.
Do you want to finally come back?
Yes, I'd like to add one point, matters that the house continues in multiple occupancy and is successful at the present, and the landlord is not prepared to say that he is being now an agent of some hospital or other.
I'm sure that he is, the people who've come from there, quite clearly recovering alcoholics or mental hospital patients, or possibly people from prison, and I've known enough people in my time to know this.
And it is working very, very successful at the moment with the current set of tenants.
However, there's clearly a need for some sort of monitoring and for some support erm other than erm some other support.
The landlord is not prepared to come up front and say that's what he's doing.
Unfortunately, I suspect because he fears a reaction from his neighbours, and I'm afraid he's right.
He'd be very aware of what's likely to happen.
He is trying to do something about it, though, I'm sure.
Right, and this will call for some sensitivity in terms of how we handle this.
Caroline and Shereen, is there anything else you want to comment on, otherwise I would ask that you'd come back to me on this in more detail.
I think I'd just like to add that I think that this could possibly be a very big piece of work.
Exactly.
And I think it would actually need, if it's going to be taken on board, somebody appointed to look at this, or it be put in somebody's job brief and I would have thought ideally that it would be placed with the community worker, and I don't know quite how we're placed for community workers in East Oxford, but maybe it's something we could put to that department.
I hear what you say, and I hesitate to make any further comment on that, given the current climate, but let's set about just examining the shape of the difficulty at the moment, and see what we can as it were immediately deal with ourselves, and what we can try and persuade other people to help us to know .
Will you come back to me in terms of who you want to invite, taking on Liz Kermey's point about involving people themselves if they so wish, and we'll consult with the opposition liaison member and the vice-chair.
But in principle we agree do we not, to back multi-agency meeting, given what we said in the discussion and we will come back to you with something that's maybe a bit more specific, and more easy to discuss, may I say.
Thank you very much indeed for coming.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you for bringing it forward.
Thank you very much.
We're back to the normal agenda, item eight on page thirty-six.
Will you also while you're looking at this look at page thirty-seven, which is the pollution and nuclear issues control sub-committee.
You will see there there has been a detailed discussion on this white paper, and members from that sub-committee made comments.
I would suggest we do not need a second read of the discussion, but that can people keep an eye on , or try and change what is already there on pollution itself.
Peter, you're introducing this on page thirty-six.
Yes, I think it's totally clear that what we need is a short message, and it's a white paper, and therefore it's inviting a message, so what we really need is a short message to go with the A B C and the government act on the two S P's and I would give an undertaking at this point that it will go under the chief environmental health officers' name.
Yes, quite.
While you're thinking about it, there are three quick things that you might like to add in, one is on page seventy-four, which, erm seventy-four?
I think it's seventy-nine, Peter.
Yes, seventy-nine, it's the, in particular one a, I think concerns this community greatly.
The document included no indication of the role of local authorities, or the resources needed by local authorities.
We intend to take this recommendation for action.
And if you actually look at this paper, there's quite a bit at the end of the day that the local authority will need to do, and I think we need to underline that and to get money.
The second point, briefly, is that the white paper has turned its face on the establishment of an environmental protection agency, and independent environment protection agency, and erm, you may feel strongly, I know there was another report that came out just about that time that erm was advocating it, and you may feel that what is needed is a central, independent environmental protection agency.
This paper only gives erm an, what is called an integrated pollution inspectorate, now unfortunately with those sort of central inspectorates is that after the public's attention has drifted on, they tend to be erm, they tend to dwindle in numbers, as we've seen with the present pollution inspectorate.
Now, thirdly, is on this question of C O 2 emission.
If you look at the report, White Paper, you'll notice that it's sticking to a, a freezing of the nineteen-ninety levels by the year two thousand and five, and you may feel that you would like to see this country come more into line with the other E E C countries and ask for a freezing by the year two thousand.
So those are three, anyway, three things erm that you might like to think about for a short message for a response to the White Paper.
Michael.
And can I ask members not to repeat the discussion of the pollution sub.
Just be very brief, chair, erm could I ask that we have a report before council on this, and I know it will be an extra two hours on the poor council debate, but I think this is so important, and it does affect the planet for hundreds of years to come, and I think if we can't have a discussion on this in full council, well, it's the most important thing we've had for years probably, and I think we should have a discussion before council sit.
Can I ask for a list of the full report before council, so it will give us a chance to have a debate there rather than here.
You can, and we will.
Anne?
It was just on a minute on page seventy-nine, I think we want to get the support of local M Ps, one a has I think, has been just indicated, is contradictory, it might be better to say, ‘although the document indicated that local authorities would be expected to undertake extra, an extra, or extra duties, the resources needed are, no indication was given of how there would be extra resources, or something like that, you see it's contradictory at the moment, it says there's no indication of the role, and then says that they would need resources, and actually if you look through the document, you will see from time-to-time it is indicated what local authorities are expected to do, for instance recycling of litter and the lot, and I think that that might be actually picked up by M P's and say, ‘Well, what actually have you, do you mean to say’, well, what we're really saying, are we not, that here is an indication of things that we're expected to do, but as usual, of course , the government hasn't indicated what erm where the resources were coming from.
Kate?
Sorry, chair, would you wish, when we consider this, do you wish to make the amendment?
Well, you won't be able to do that until we do consider the, I mean, but, the reason I referred to page seventy-nine, is to ensure that we do not repeat ourselves, and that those of us on the sub-committee, remember what we said then, and decide whether we want to repeat that.
I mean, on the items of wording, I mean, that can be done on two sub-committees.
Yes, fine, I just asked, just checking.
Are there items that people, I mean, I take the point about freezing C O 2 emissions.
That's woolly to say the least.
We may want to make the point that if we are to be committed to doing something about the global warming of the ozone layer then we will need to say when we will do it by.
And ensure there's a programme which achieves that.
Are there any other additions to that, if not  Patrick.
Yes, I'd like to support Michael in the setting up of an environmental protection agency.
I think that if we leave it to 
I don't think it was Michael who suggested it.
No, I didn't.
Well!
It was Peter.
Oh, yes, Peter, sorry.
I think it would skip to environment being the prerogative of local authorities, there will be a great variation across the country, and I don't think anybody seriously would expect that to happen about health and safety at work, and I think the same should be true of the environment.
Right, just to move us on, then, since you're all going to have a go at this at council, yes?
Sorry, I just wanted to refer to page eighty-one, erm sixth form conference, thirty-three.
Yes
erm Students will be asked to report back to the next erm sub-committee
Yes they will
So, shall we have a full report then to the next environment and health protection sub-committee of that report.
Yes.
Can I just bring you back to the item before us, which is ‘This Common Inheritance’, and ask you to endorse the sub-committees suggestions, i.e. repeat them, as comments from the health committee, with the additions from the vice-chair on environmental protection agency.
on point more adequately made by the deputy about C O two emission, are there any other comments that people want to make, or are you agreed that we refer back to council as it is?
Are we then taking up the point that Liz Spokes made on item one a, on page seven.
Procedurally Nonnie we can't do that till we come to the sub committee.
Well, so that is how it's going to council.
I think it's a great pity.
Clearly that will not be the case that that's how it goes to council.
But procedurally, we can amend it when we get to the sub-committee.
Is the sub-committee then going to meet before council.
No, we have not yet taken the minutes for this sub-committee, I have simply asked you to take it together with this agenda item.
All I was going to say was that clearly I agree with one thing, but one would assume that as the paper is a really a general outline that we would be seeing specific targets as the agenda's worked through over the next two three years.
Oh, yes, if the government's still there, I'm sure they'll do that, yes.
Thank you Graham.
Well, I think they'll be a government still there!
No, yours.
Labour!
Can I then move you on, and we will correct the pollution and control sub committee minutes when we get to them just  and Nonnie.
Item nine, there's a report for the half year ending on page forty-one, Tony?
Yes, chair, erm, I was supposed to give the figures if they'd come out at this time.
You'll notice one or two minor changes.
You'll notice that instead of complaints signed in what would be technically the paragraph where they talk about service requests, because many of the requests we get from members of the public to provide a service are not necessarily complaints, but they do need our help.
You'll see that both the number of requests for service, and the number of visits made are well up on previous half years, and although some of that is due to probably the highest figure on insect complaints we've ever had for six months, and erm it's not all that, much of it is lately the department has been very, very busy indeed.
On food control, the level of food hygiene inspections at seven hundred and thirty we've achieved by buying in consultants to do some work for us in our priority area, and we're were able to do that with Derek Welk's retirement, leaving us with some unspent staff , and so we've achieved a higher figure there than we expected we would do.
erm My cause for concern, and I think it's one that's been echoed in a number of places, is the still very high figure for food-poisoning outbreaks, for food-poisoning cases, erm you'll see we're not as high as the previous comparable half-year of last year, which was ninety-two, but that included the Keble outbreak, which you're well aware of, but at thirty-two for Oxford for a half year, that's a very high figure.
We haven't had that sort of figure very often before.
erm The national figure seems to be, the national figure of food poisoning cases this year looks like being in excess of sixty thousand.
erm it was around fifty-four thousand last year, and the figure's just going up and up.
The answer to it I just don't know, but the Food Safety Act deals with some of the future, some of the future objectives in terms of better training for people who handle food, and tighter controls on food businesses, so it's something to look forward to, and hopefully in years to come the figure will begin to drop.
On erm food and noise, we're still very, very busy indeed, and our figure for noise inspection is higher than it ever has been before, and the comment that was made under that section will show you that some of that most certainly is the amount of work that the  team had to carry out during the summer, one of the benefits of our glorious summer is that most of us slept with our windows fully open for three months or more and one of the dis-benefits was that if anybody else down the road had a party that went beyond normal bed-time, everybody shared that, and our  team was very busy in consequence.
erm On occupational health, and I don't plead for those figures, because for a time, until Helen left to have her baby, we were fully staffed, and the number of inspections and the number of notices served and the number of prohibition notices served are very encouraging indeed.
The impact of the section has been very broadly based in the city, and for the first time we've added for you in very brief terms, a Domiciliary Health information of just the total number of visits made by the city health care, erm and the level of work in terms of notices served, and prosecutions, note, going up in most of the sections, particularly their units they're small numbers, but they are significant, just the same, and the table on the top of page forty-four, erm as I said earlier, I think we reached the highest level of insect complaints in the summer that we've ever had to deal with, it's very usual for us to deal with a thousand, over in the summer period, this time we dealt with sixteen hundred.
An amazing amount of work carried out by the three members of the pest control team, with some additional help with larger jobs during the summer period.
Thank you, Tony.
I'd remind members that this report also goes to council.
It's very useful if you have detailed questions on this particular report that you do let myself and the chief know well in advance, so that you get a detailed answer, quite frankly.
erm I've seen Graham, Anne and Diane.
Yes, erm very, very quickly, erm I notice that the swimming pool and river bathing visits had more than doubled, I just wondered what the cause of that was, and whether in fact it was mainly related to the swimming pools or to the river bathing bit erm places, and the second one is, regarding the noise, I notice that it has shot up, the number of visits to seven twenty one, but in fact, the prosecution's only gone up to one, and I wondered if Mr Fenn could tell us whether in fact because of the higher profile that had been given to this erm activity, due to its possible cut, whether in fact more people are aware of it and there were more
Undoubtedly
should we say, complaints of a casual nature, rather than a particularly serious nature?
Well,.
erm On the question of the river samples and pool samples, yes, I think one of the city pools, one of the school pools we had a bit of a problem, so that took much of concentrated attention of it for a period of two or three weeks, so that's probably a reflection, I don't think much of it relates to the river sample.
We take samples throughout the year from the river, but they're really at background level, and not very helpful I must admit, in terms of getting the quality of the river improved, we can't do that.
On the noise question, yes, undoubtedly the increased erm number of complaints is partly due to the higher profile that was achieved during the summer, but erm no, I don't think that the complaints were frivolous, they were complaints that were, that needed attention, and there will be one or two prosecutions following through.
Remember this set of figures closes on thirtieth of September.
Very often prosecutions follow on sometime after the event happens.
It may be worth saying, Tony that Graham's already talked to officers and it's worth your while talking to people on the house-to-house duty rota.
Parties then with noise, just imagine going up to the door where there are fifty or sixty seething people in there.
In order to serve a notice you have to get a name, and that's enormously difficult, because I mean, practical difficulties need to be taken on board, Anne and then Diana.
Well, having had to avail ourselves of the help of the officer who got rid of our gigantic wasp nest, I should like to say what a superb job they do, but I just wondered in view of the tremendous number, whether there is some kind of way of preventions.
I know in our case, and therefore probably in a lot that it isn't always possible, they'll always find a way in, but if there was some perhaps advice to people it might bring down this number of complaints, that you could perhaps do before the wasp season begins, I don't know whether that's a possibility or not.
I don't think it's possible, chair, but I will talk with Clive Williams who's our expert in that.
I think the main reason for so many wasps this year is to, warm summers, and but it's basically the long summer period, because we started, you see on the wasp complaints in May, which we don't really start until half way through June, and we kept going right through, right until the middle of October, and they normally stop round the end of August, so that's the main reason; a very long, hot summer.
Thanks.
I'd like to second Anne's congratulations really, to the, to the men who deal with wasps nest, because they're very usually men who come along!
They are all men.
They are?
Well, I know he was a man, I saw him!
All of them are.
And, I certainly have taken steps to make sure that I don't get a wasps nest, but in that particular area again, because he begged to point out to me where the wasp was getting access to, a little tiny space above my bedroom window, and that has now been sealed, so hopefully the wasps another year will find a home somewhere else that isn't quite so close to my open bedroom window.
So perhaps if people were aware of some of the places where wasps can go within their home, they might be able to sort of take those conscious  That wasn't actually what I had  
Well, be quick then!
Nothing, nothing fascinating.
I just wanted to know what on page forty-two under ‘Water sampling’, what the bracketing figures say four u stroke s, one u stroke s, etcetera meant, and on page forty-three, why under ‘programme and revisiting inspection’ this four one nine p was starred.
I just wondered what those contexts  and you will be bound to be asked it in council if it's not asked now.
Thank you very much, Diana.
Thank you.
Chair, we do class as unsatisfactory those samples that the laboratory would covers don't reach certain standards, whatever the standard may be, and that's why we concentrate on that figure that the bathing  unsatisfactory at one particular pool, where there was a serious problem.
And the starred items, I think the starred items, I'm not sure now, I think, can you help here?
No, I'm sorry, Ken.
I'm pretty sure that the 
Programmed visits?
Programmed visits, yes, I think they'll have been debt inspections that have carried out, whereas the higher figures above them are audit, and these are the ones that take more time, and are programmed to deal with everything, you know.
May I suggest, may I suggest that's put on the report before it goes to council.
Thank you, Nonnie finally 
Yes, erm on page forty-one, ‘unsatisfactory samples’, we have six others, erm is there a general category below six, like meat or something like that?
If there was a general category, I think it would be put, however.
Yes.
The category ‘others’, under ‘unsatisfactory samples of food’ six.
Yes, they could be a range of things, chair, I'll check out what they are and make sure you've got some 
Okay, Nonnie.
Yes.
The only other thing I would say is that you've got domiciliary health there on the bottom of page forty-three for the first time, a thing that we certainly asked for on your behalf.
I suggest that the figures you've got before you are not terribly, terribly useful, and that you do invite domiciliary health to come back to you for three months to talk to you about their work in terms of the visits, the visits that they do.
It will be a whole lot clearer to you then, but it's there basically because it was asked for, it's inadequate because that was all they could do on the day, having been instructed to provide it.
So I apologize for that.
Could I ask, Chairman, chair the number of successful prosecutions?
You've got it later on in the agenda, Arthur, can we wait for that one?
And the report for the half year will go to the council as you've heard.
Item ten, Matthew's been patient, where is he, he's there.
Food control in Oxford on page forty-five.
Can I ask you before inviting you to speak to us in two or three minutes on this, say that the recommendation, in a sense I think it has been overtaken, in that there is now under fifteen a the very distinct possibility of a transfer of a very technical post from the pollution section by the end of the year.
That's to say someone is leaving and we are going to take that post out and put it into the food section, and on b, I would say to Matthew that before committing us to a budget of two and a half thousand against a background of ten percent cuts, I would suggest that the health educational help-line and their day-long courses for E H Os might be made good use of in the forth-coming year.
But 
Thank you chair.
I think first of all, I'd like to be very brief, but just to say the purpose of this short report with the appendices has not got any special status with food control, just set the record straight as to what we are capable of doing currently and what we can't do.
erm That was with the current staff resources with certain changes since the summer.
Now, it's obviously very good that a position is going to be replaced by a technician, for which a, which at the moment is elsewhere in the department.
What erm my view is that we have a current shortfall, and I think the figures highlight this, and the shortfall is in the highest of the high risk, if you like, the ultra high-risk area of catering.
erm Although one would hate to be, I don't want to be accused of being elitist and saying that E H O's must do a particular job, but what I would like to say it that we need people who are trained to a sufficient level to be able to do the ultra high risk catering area, as distinct from other high-risk areas.
It's my professional opinion that we have a problem there in terms of training and expertise, and I feel that, as you've said, the technician is forth-coming, we will be obviously having to draft very, very carefully a job description, but I feel that training requirements will be such that it will be very, very difficult to fulfil those requirements and indeed to cope with this ultra high-risk catering area.
It's my considered opinion that the only way we can do that is by an E H O, and we will find, eventually, that we will suffer continued short-fall in terms of ultra high-risk inspection.
I think it's fair to say that we've gone a long, long way in Oxford to breaking down barriers with regard to the inspection priorities, and we are in a position within the city where we have  nature of, if you like, technicians and staff that are doing jobs that in many other surrounding areas, and indeed throughout the country are the prerogative of E H O, and these include areas specified as high-risk by MAFF, and include a great bulk of all customer and consumer complaints.
The only area that I'm saying is in need for careful consideration is that related to risks associated with the possibilities of food poisoning and very high-risk food handling.
I think really that is all I can say, chair, erm in addition to your comments.
Thanks very much indeed for your report, Matthew, it's certainly very informative, and in an ideal world, I think we might have made a different decision today.
Are there comments or questions immediately, Catherine?
I do have a question and, and it hasn't made, that hasn't made it particularly clear as to where we are, you hinted that, and I think that was also seconded here that there might now be a post of some kind to carry on for instance the thing that I'm particularly worried about is that there's a sort of hiatus in the heartbeat awards, which I think would be a tragedy if that happened, and I want to be absolutely sure that that is, isn't so.
Do I take it that actually the remarks that have just been made are really in favour of having a third E H O, but that in fact that that in circumstances, will not be possible.
So I really, what I'm asking, is that perhaps it could be set out exactly now what stage we have reached, and what the recommendation is as from today.
What you have before you is Matthew feeling and indeed, I would take it, supported by the chief officer.
erm There always has been the situation since Derek Roberts retired, and in fact his post was put in the pollution section, where there was only one E H O, the agreement then that there would be a swap straight E H O for technician swap, but food had traditionally, as long as I've been involved have three E H Os.
Now, I don't expect Matthew to support that for one moment, but what I'm saying to committee is that is our pragmatic solution at this moment.
I don't expect the heartbeat award scheme to suffer, I will be in touch with Matthew fairly closely to ensure that, but I think the position of the labour group is that we cannot support these recommendations as they are but we offer you a compromise solution.
Nonnie?
Yes, erm, presumably the training for a technical post in the pollution section will give kind of basic bacteriology, which will be, you know, essential for going over into the food section, erm I mean, what will become.
I think that's probably not the case, it isn't a person we're transferring over, it's a bit better than that, it's a post, which means that Matthew can advertise with a particular emphasis on food background.
He may be right, he may not be able to recruit the ideal person.
On the other hand there are some qualifications that technicians may take, we may be lucky, we may get such a person, and I hope so.
Yes, so it isn't a person.
Right.
Matthew, are there, erm Diana?
Thank you.
It's a, it's a fascinating report and having been involved in the Food Forum discussion, when we, it was reported to us that we'd actually lost a community nutritionist, I read this with great interest to see just how now the professional was seen through sections.
And, I mean, reluctantly we have to accept that this is not an ideal world, but I mean, just now, we were actually looking at the number of food hygiene inspections that have been done over the last few months, which have increased enormously, it just means, I mean it emphasises the fact that food has changed, food, and the number of places that are actually serving food now I mean, the corner shop does sandwiches.
Everybody seems to be producing food, wherever you go food is on offer, food is for sale.
I realise that many of these are not high-risk areas, but they are areas that our officers have got to, got to keep an eye on.
And numbers are increasing while our staffing has actually, actually decreased.
erm We've got to recognise the professional advice that Matthew is giving us in this report, that he, he needs professional trained staff, and it grieves me that really we can only offer a technician when he is asking for something more.
But we are giving, we are giving him a post, another body, and hopefully with a very careful job description he will get a trained person, because we also recognise the fact that Oxford's a marvellous place for people to come.
The environmental health department is seen throughout Britain as being a nice place to come.
I mean, I keep hearing that when I come into the environmental health department, that, just that people are interested in what Oxford are doing.
They keep  busy, don't they.
Well set up.
Yes.
So we're one of the important environmental health departments, sure, so hopefully we will actually get somebody who is really very good, a food technician to assist in this erm field, and there have, I hope that through Food Forum we may well be able to help Matthew with his, well not just Matthew, but help, help that section with the nutrition advice that he feels is still lacking in his team under the circumstances.
Thanks very much Diana.
Can I just remind members that, I mean there's a member of the technical staff in this room now.
We have a number of technicians in the environmental health department who do some sterling work, and I know that no one here would want you to suppose that they are a kind of second-string person.
They do a different kind of work, they've traditionally done considerably responsible work within Oxford City's Environmental Health Department, so there isn't a suggestion on the part of any of us that they are somehow lesser beings, because that is not the case at all.
Can I put it to you that we cannot today accept the recommendation on page forty-eight.
But I do move today that we transfer the technical post that will become vacant in the pollution section by the end of this year to the food section, and that Matthew together with the chief environmental health officer consider how best to write a job description, and advertise for that post, and that while I do not see us securing a budget of two thousand five hundred pounds as under fifteen b, I do recommend that the health education authority are contacted, that their help-line is used, and that our E H O's use their premises in the coming new year.
I am assured that they are advertised in the Institutions Journal.
Matthew, that isn't all you want, but maybe we'll be able to discuss this again in twelve months time.
Thank you very much for the work you've put in.
Alright.
Thank you chair.
Thanks.
I note that we have Terry Randal here.
Maybe we should take item seventeen and allow him, is ten minutes going to be enough?
erm I'll try and do this in ten minutes.
You'll try and do this in ten minutes.
Let's straight into seventeen then, I'll just remind committee that we need to move to the confidential section at five o'clock today in order to get it finished.
Item seventeen is the age-well project, the report is circulated on page a hundred and eight.
We're particularly delighted actually that Tony Randall has come along to share his own very particular views on this project.
You'll remember that we had a pilot project in South Oxford Health Centre, Tony is one of the G P's there, I'm expecting that he's going to be very positive about this project since we all are, in terms of it's practice service delivery.
Well, then Tony, tell us about how it feels at your end.
Okay, I'll give you a very brief background to the project.
It started in the Autumn of eighty-eight, when Phil approached me and said, ‘Look, we would like to consider putting our services that we do offer to finance in a more effective way’, running alongside that was a project being run by Oxfordshire Health Authority where they were sending postal surveys to elderly people; people over the age of seventy erm sixty-five at one point, and were getting back a huge amount of information on their perceived needs.
We thought perhaps we can use that as a goal standard, and pick up what actually happens with our project to compare the two.
So that's where we were in the autumn of eighty-eight.
By spring of eighty-nine, when the project had started, we'd gone quite a long way down the road, we'd decided that we wanted to be looking at what was feasible in general practice.
Get this machine working over here.
What was feasible general practice, and whether that was the best place to be contacting the local people.
Now, the reason we particularly were interested in this was that from the questionnaire we already were beginning to get back some information, and we discovered that eighty-six percent of people had seen their G P in the previous year, and maybe if we could introduce them to the age-well project at some point during that contact, we would be able to achieve something.
Against that there'll be seventeen percent of this population was seeing home-helps, five percent was seeing social workers.
So we though that we would try it in general practice.
Next thing to do was to set up a form.
Looks horrendous, but bear in mind these elderly people have just answered a sixteen page postal questionnaire with no help.
And what's more eighty-six percent of them answered it.
And I was quite impressed by that.
We gave them a sheet of paper which said what we were, what we're doing, and said please, if you want any help in any of those areas, just tick the box, and if you don't want any help, tick this little box, and that's what they had to fill in.
And they were given this when they were brought into the surgery by the receptionist.
We discovered very rapidly that if it was the doctor that had to present the age-well project to the patients that quite often they forgot to do it.
In greater detail I could look at what kind of coverage we've got, but I think in ten minutes I don't have time to do that.
Suffice it to say that amongst the people who were not contacted by this project within the first year are some of those seeing doctors on eight occasions.
The receptionists are much at giving out these things than doctors.
They can do it while they're waiting, couldn't they.
On the back of the form, we simply have a method of writing down anything that's interested, and also includes a sticker of who the person is, a particular one.
So I thought we could look at results now, which are probably the thing that's most interesting.
Just taking that form with those boxes, that's how people responded.
This thing breaks it down by age, as I say, we're looking at seventy-fives and over.
More than half the people don't want any help at all.
Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily.
erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating.

No, no, I agree.
Are you laughing 
Why don't you 
at my feet?
Mm.
I think you should wear those at appointments.
No, my clients get a big enough giggle as it is.
I don't think
by your slippers.
Do you have anything to do with the Hampton Court area Steven  er, work-wise?
Well, have I been there?
No, erm  there's an office there isn't there?
Or  have we got an office in Hampton Court?
No, I don't think we have.
Oh.
I thought we were  you know, working up there.
Well, no, it's not General Portfolio.
Actually, just started working for General Portfolio.
It is in Kingston.
Might be.
There's not one in Kingston.
Sharon .
I dunno.
Where d'ya meet her then?
I met her from, she used to work at Kirshaws.
Oh .
Probably applied the same time I did.
Oh.
She smokes like a chimney.
Mm.
Have you ever seen anybody completely obscured by her own smoke, it's Sharon.
.
Chuck us the water would you?
She's a bit of a goer as well int she?
Is she?
Isn't she?
Yeah but 
Didn't she order a punch so she was drunk ?
No, that was Tracey.
I thought Tracey and Sharon used to get drunk at lunchtime on a Friday and have a punch up.
No.
Only Tracey would do that.
Our Trace.
Ah.
Oh dear.
Oh.
It's supposed to be a bit it'll stick up don't worry.
No, it's ours.
Don't poke it Martin, or else 
it'll .
There's nothing worse than somebody poking your pudding is there?
No .
It smells absolutely foul.
Don't come and poke yours, do we?
You do.
She does.
Don't.
We never, we never cook anything
cos we ain't got a table.
Well we have but it int got any legs on.
No, she must be working out of the Kingston office cos we don't 
I would have thought so.
we don't have one at Hampton Court.
No.
Or Hampton.
Su sugar.
Oh.
There you go.
So how are you Susan?
I'm not very well.
Aren't you?
You got this cold thing everybody 
She's fluey.
else has got?
She's fluey.
Yeah.
Mm.
This one mine?
One of these days, I live in hope for a bug going round that everybody else has, but not me.
I've always got the one, I'm always the one saying to you  fiddle, everyone seems to have that
Yeah.
including me.
Tt.
I've got a sore throat  and a bit of a cough.
And I do feel genuinely rough.
And you ache, don't you?
I ache from here to the top.
I think it sounds like flu.
I had a thumping headache yesterday.
But that seems to have gone now.
Mm.
I've put
Stiff neck as well?
Yeah.
Ooh yeah.
Oh here's some Marmite crisps if you want any?
No?
Okay.
Be like that.
Well erm  I was 
absolutely freezing cold.
These  always hit me.
It sounds awfully familiar I'm afraid.
Mm.
So I had a bath  and I thought it'd warm me up but I was, I was freezing  weren't I?
Yeah.
And I had to get the old erm  quilt down.
Mm mm.
I don't believe I'm bad 
all week.
Not usually this bad with a cold.
I mean, I've been off college and stuff  just  feeling really tired 
Yeah.
all the time.
It's the .
Alright.
I mean, normally I just keep going, you know, and sort of don't, but I've been so aching so much that  it's terrible!
Yes.
Is that my cup?
Yes.
I think.
Yeah.
I wonder if we could get away with telling my mum  that we'll go away for Christmas and New Year.
Why, you going away?
Well she's going away anyway.
Oh yes you 
Is she?
you're going to the Lake District aren't you?
Yep.
Yeah.
We've got it booked.
Have you?
Yup.
Aha.
Oh jolly good!
We have.
We'll be taking
I hate to tell you this but the er  the forecast for the weather is pretty awful this year.
Snow?
Lots of it.
I think we're gonna have a 
hard winter this year.
Hello!
Hello.
Hello .
Alright?
D'ya win or lose?
Hi!
Ah!
Where's Jasmine?
Hello.
Hello my plant.
Hello.
She's gone upstairs.
Tell her I said hello.
They seem to be downstairs.
She hi 
She seems to be .
Hello sweetheart!
Hello!
Whoop woo woo!
Mayhem!
Yes I thought we were gonna get snowed in up there.
Hello!
Well I ra when are you going up then?
Twenty seventh.
The day after Boxing Day.
You woo woo!
Yeah.
Woo!
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!
Woo, woo, woo!
The fact that you don't mind talking about it.
Yes.
Yes there's always the
Maybe
perhaps the Monday after Christmas, and then coming back the Monday after.
And I'll ask  
Maybe you could connect the tape  to the television and then have a film on and just leave it running.
So the ac that's the actual script.
I think it'll be fairly obvious somehow.
What's that?
Did you win or lose?
Not a lot.
Lost.
You lost?
Where was it today?
Mm dear.
Ah no, racing, ah, it's cos I bought a horse, that's why
Oh!
erm  you might have lost a lot.
No I I, er 
Have you been racing today?
No I backed the first winner today and that got me out of trouble.
Er, don't give her those.
Why?
Give her a brick .
No, she actually just, I haven't seen for a long time so she can have one of these.
No, but that's excessively  for her.
It's not cos she only gets a little bit.
Where's Jussy?
Dunno.
Jussy!
Jussy man !
I'll put them away in the fridge for you.
Jussy man.
How are your horses nowadays?
They're fine thanks.
Yeah, very well.
You been down to see them recently?
No, cos I've been away for a couple of days.
Mm mm.
She has been down in Dorset .
I always go back  
What do you mean he gets his ?
does that one, that I'm not quite so much of the .
Yeah, but er  .
Oh he's got plenty of them.
Yeah.
Feeling like
the end of the world.
Death warmed up.
Mm.
How's ?
Not bad.
But it's bloody cold out there isn't it?
I know, it's a bit nip.
Cor!
Bit of a frosty one.
Bit of a, bit of a sad day though isn't it?
Lovely, sunny 
Oh yeah.
Same again tomorrow, so they say.
I like starting off the day with a  ten mile run followed by
I like this one.
hot chocolate  two rounds of toast 
And that one at erm 
and a piece of er, ginger cake.
stopped at the tea rooms after  completely over the top ordering.
All the  all this food started  turning off .
Completely, the chocolate, hot chocolate with bloody whipped cream on the top and everything.
God!
I wish I'd  cycled six miles home!
So you worked it all off again.
I don't think so.
Not in, not in sixteen miles.
I should think you probably just about got through the toast possibly.
I've torn off my bit.
I tipped .
Yes.
Did you er  make that?
Or did you 
Yeah, I don't do, I don't do .
Want to go upstairs and sit down?
Oh.
I will.
The food's not far off is it?
Well we'll go upstairs and eat.
Shall we go upsta are we gonna eat upstairs?
Yeah.
Can do.
Whenever.
Whatever.
Whenever, whatever we feel like really.
done?
We're not far off now.
What's this in there?
In the oven Steven?
That is the .
That's the starter.
Chicken.
Frederick!
Yes?
This dog's standing here again?
Is he?
Yeah.
Yes.
.
Yes, but I must admit I'll sort him out.
I'll see what we're gonna do when the dinner comes.
Very thinly sliced.
Oh!
We haven't done the mush   Kitty!
Very thin, and very thinly sliced.
You haven't done the mushrooms !
Oh!
Strewth!
Quick!
There you go.
Sa say it.
We always put mushrooms in it.
And erm  extremely thinly sliced.
Yeah.
We always put these, just forgotten to do them.
Oh.
You'll have to do them 
Cut them thin otherwise they won't cook in time.
Oh won't they?
Yeah.
What?
Oh you're
Three and half millimetres.
You're  
though Martin.
Sorry?
Grab a knife then Martin?
I gotta wash them first.
Okay, we need to wash them but it doesn't matter too much does it?
I've got to 
No.
scrub them haven't I?
Well it is, I wrote it down when we were on the list 
Wash her hair.
and Steve put it on top of here.
Shampoo and rinse.
Look Martin, those mushrooms .
What, that list I gave you earlier on?
Yes.
I don't think you could argue with that.
The mushrooms .
Right then take 
Like if you're gonna be happy in this household
Test the finger  you  are they just  oh God, they're much bigger than we had already.
So how many are you doing?
Well it's the thought that counts.
Oh!
Well that's enough.
Mm mm.
That's quite a little gadget isn't it?
Where d'ya put
Excuse me!
Saves gunging the old erm
Sweet, no less.
One very  small knife for slicing the mushrooms.
Deep emancipation.
I'm busy.
Well he's gonna pay me back tomorrow.
Oh.
Actually they're quite clean these mushrooms.
How's the business been recently?
Erm, not too bad.
I don't know how that one got in there.
Yeah, not too bad.
Could be better?
Could be worse?
Well, it can always be better can't it?
It is 
Thing was  I knew he'd forgotten something.
I was just looking for something.
You see, I could tell these things.
Well Martin, Joe, er er Martin just said  erm  what would look nicer in there are some erm  some mushrooms, and I looked and I thought, well we always do mushrooms in 
You stupid boy!
there.
There should be mushrooms in there.
And lo and behold there isn't.
Come on, chop chop!
Did you put in those thingies?
Yes.
Nice hat!
Keeps you warm, yeah?
That's the only thing.
Perhaps I could do with another one.
How are you Thierry darling?
I'm alright thanks.
You?
Okay.
I heard you were in the er 
the bath weren't you?
I was.
Yes.
Well and truly in the bath.
In the  triathlon?
Yes.
Second out the water or something?
Yes.
First, first .
Where did you finish?
Not second.
No.
No, I was about twenty sixth from the end actually, but
How many?
Twenty sixth.
Wasn't bad, and I finished.
That's good.
That's pretty good
Which is alright
twenty sixth.
considering it was fairly   considering it's pretty er 
Cos only about ten men finished  in front of you or something?
Yes.
Oh no, there were more than that.
I was twenty sixth in the women's, not overall.
Still, that's good.
Oh right.
So I had to put up with the, I had a really shitty cycle  and then, my run was, you know okay 
Well you probably 
for me, but 
you probably tried hardest in your swim didn't you?
Well I don't think I did really, I just  wasn't very sharp really.
I, well I know you have days where you just  you feel alright 
Had you
but then 
prepared alright?
you just go across, not really.
Cos then, the Worlds 
Right.
were only a month before so I sort of war wound down a bit, so 
Yeah.
I mean, I wasn't really feeling, you know when some, sometimes you know you're gonna do really well and sometimes you think, mm mm
Er er  yeah.
not really terribly prepared for 
Pass today.
this one.
And you feel alright but people just go  shh ooh ooh  past you.
That's 
Yeah.
life really.
Just gotta do what you can really haven't you?
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna put an extra layer on.
I'm not
That's okay.
gonna
Say, that's alright.
I was just  I wouldn't be bothered anyway.
No you probably wouldn't  actually .
You know me.
Oh God !
What?
In fact, Jon  's 
Yeah.
here.
I haven't seen him for ages.
Well I haven't either.
Whose lager's that?
I mean whose thingie?
It's mine, I was just gonna give it to you.
Is it?
Well in that, actually I'll come and sit on it and then I can fondle Jon's knees while I'm there.
I'm not speaking to you, not with that on.
You don't have to say anything.
Who's got the best knee then?
What?
Oh well erm  different quality of knees really.
You're joking!
Mine's all bone.
That's what I mean, you know, depends 
Bony knees.
depends what turns you on really.
You never know I might be 
Are you sure because erm  when we were away  er James took some photographs
Yeah.
and I saw  just how bony my legs were.
Were in shorts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh!
Vegetables!
Ah that's alright.
I got terri I mean, honestly er  I mean people are so 
Well that's a point, speaking of photos  can I have the ones you took at ?
The ones of me.
Please.
I mean, I realize you've probably got them pinned up by your bed, but
Ah, I've made them up into poster size.
Yeah.
Get three D ones made up.
Are you, are you coming to that dinner?
No I'm not.
You're not?
No.
Yeah I know.
Martin won't let me come cos he says it's too expensive.
So, when is it anyway?
Oh probably the  er er  it's worse than I do sometimes.
No, November  the twenty something.
Oh great!
That's very helpful.
Yeah, I dunno why, I sort of oh yes well, I assumed we were going and then he said it was too expensive.
And then, he sort of thought well  funny  sell my body.
I don't know.
I dunno.
It's something like twenty quid each.
That could take me ages to earn.
What d'ya do?
Depending who I'm selling my body to.
I'm a student so I haven't got any money.
But, judging by how crap the Christmas dinner was  I'm not really particularly tempted, but
Tell him you want to go.
That's what we'll do anyway.
Will you dance with me if I come?
What?
Yes.
That means I will.
Yes.
Okay.
As long as it's slow.
Oh, alright then.
Sounds good to me.
You're warned though 
That's worth 
I've got two left feet.
that's worth twenty quid.
That's alright, if you tread on my feet I'll just pick you up and carry you then.
Yeah, that's true.
And put you over my 
put you over my shoulder .
You probably could.
A fireman's lift then.
Oh dear.
And we can  disappear outside and everyone'll be talking.
Oh yeah!
Absolutely.
You'll have to deal with Martin though.
Can you run faster than him?
Erm
no, I can't even run for a bus.
Actually probably wouldn't, probably wouldn't be very bothered actually.
I'll just have my bike outside and quickly get on.
I should.
Yeah.
Oh dear.

Oh

Hello it's Mark from the Tri-Club.
I thought Mark from the Tri-Club, Mark, who the hell is Mark?

He said training?
What training?
I said well, you know, and I thought it could be somebody here  as well.
Let's face it, I made a complete prat of myself.
And then Martin, I sa I still couldn't think who it was.
Martin came home and said oh is that Mark fro Mark from Woking?
I thought,ah, ha !
The wrong bloody number.
Oops!

It could, could it not be anybody?
Well I know.
God!
Could have been a  if I didn't know any attractive Marks Tri-Club
Oh, so you di

I mean if it ha if somebody had said it was Danny from the Tri-Club I would have had a
I would have been in there, you know.
Oh.
Just on the off chance.
Just on the off chance it was that Danny.
Ha!

Yes.
I mean, that's like ringing up and saying it's Jon really isn't it?
But I do ring.
You do ri well we know you well enough to know your voice though.
It's the bear.

Six?
Twelve?
How old is he?
A bit young.
I thought you said he was fourteen.
A bit young for me.
Even for me, eh?
Mm.
Even for a little baby like you.
I know.
The youngest, the youngest below me I've ever gone for is three years younger.
Well that was  that was fairly excessive.
And that was when you were six.
God he was sexy!
No, it was when about 
about  seventeen  and he was  fourteen.
God he was fabulous!
The best kisser I've ever met.

I can't cope.
Yeah I, I know how you feel mine's  mine's .

Sitting up painting her nails at midnight, in bed.
She said it was just wonderful not having anybody shouting at her to turn the light off.
Mm mm.
Oh dear.
I said my luxury when Martin was out was eating half a very large cream cake.
And ho drinking half a bottle of wine.
We didn't quite decide which was more the .
Kitty, what are you doing Sunday?
Are you gonna go into London?
What do you want me to do then?
Good question.
What?
Are you with Martin?
Eleven o'clock.
Probably.
If it involved marshalling, definitely.
Well you can stand up.
Are you waiting?
Yeah.
Well you
I've gotta stand up just now.

Ooh!
Ooh ooh ooh !
Oh that's good .
It was a thingie reaction 
Yeah.

Reflex.
Yeah .
If I sit here, if I sit very still he'll forget about me.
He'll come this way in a minute.
Have you ever had that done it's so  bizarre, I tell you.
What, being kicked in the bollocks or  no reflexes?
Yes.
been kicked in, in the bollocks.
You get it done when you go to the doctors don't you?
Yeah.
It's bizarre cos it's like  you haven't got control.
You feel like a puppet .
Oh blimey!
Do you think I might just find anybody here who'd like a really good snog?
Not with that cold, no.
Well it's not infectious any more.
Well I would love to.
I think Martin might get a bit upset.
Well he doesn't wanna bloody snog!
He's off kissing.
He doesn't like kissing, he noticed that after two years.
I don't really like kissing very much.
Oh for God's sake!
Now you tell me!
Sex is so much better.
Ah?
Eh?
Swallow, swallow.
No it's not!
It is.
Not if you try hard.
Vastly overrated I'm afraid.
Yeah?
Mm?
It's vastly overrated.
And it's hard just to get  all the way up.
Yeah.
Oh yeah?
What are we
Yeah, the .
Come on then.
He's not looking.
It was the only time I've worn four layers on the top  in a race.
Yeah.
And it was the full kit, you know.
It was 
Oh yeah.

Mind you, that's what they all say though.

Are you cold?
Are you wanting me to warm you up ?
Want my jumper?
Mm?

Haven't you got your  ?
Tt!
Oh!
I'm really cold.
Still   I'll survive.
I know.
I'll warm you up.
There's still something there yo there's still something there you can't be that cold.
Go on.
Do your natural duties.
Gosh!
Ha!
The end of the Worlds, you know how cold it was there, and we were all going down the finish tunnel  you just, all of the blokes you just thought
There's only three of the blokes .
there's nothing there!
It's gone!
It's gone!
Well  
There's only fifteen altogether .
Not that, not that I look at that sort of thing on a regular basis so
They go  
Well when they're just standing there in a vest and shorts then there isn't much else to look at is there, really?
Yeah.
Then yo 
It was Saturday or Sunday?
What?
Are you
Twenty fourth.
Twenty fourth, is it?
Well that's why Doug's going round asking about Sunday is it?
If you are going it's best to 
Where is it?
Women in, she's gonna win women's categories.
Where is it and what is it?
Isn't there one in November or something?
You're shivering!
Is that just cos you've got your leg like that or is the other one shaking?
Sorry, that one's shaking cos you've got it tucked up, cos I'm touching you isn't it?
Yeah.
A bit 
Eh?
excited.
You like coming along here don't you?
I do.
What's this?
I like touching Jon's leg.
Yes.
Are you recording?
Don't!
Get off!
She's taping it all.
Yeah, I'm doing a local project.
But so far we've had erm, we've had  who likes kissing and who doesn't.
Sex is better with Jon cos he does it better.
And I'm a nymphomaniac.
It sounded quite good to me.
All good clean stuff.
I know.
I've gotta hand it in on Friday so I'm getting a bit desperate.
Better not mention I shave my legs on
Oh no!
on Monday.
Yesterday .
Yes, the kinkier the better really, you know.
I'd like to know where you're supposed to stop.
What d'ya mean?
Which particular section of the conversation are we talking about?
Dunno.
Where you're supposed to stop 
Jon 
shaving your legs up to.
Oh right.
Jon obviously doesn't know where to stop.
It's painful.
If he's that good.
You should u use Immac it's less painful.
Sorry?
Use Immac it's less painful.
Immac?
For your legs.
Immac?
Evil smelling pink stuff that you put all over your legs and 
Wax?
leave it.
No, no, no.
And then you leave it 
Nitromorse for legs.
then you leave it for erm
five minutes and then all your hairs drop out and then you, then you just wipe them off.
It's great.
I'd be a  
It's quite a good chat up line.
Get a girl to do it for you.
Yeah.
I, I've often had that fantasy actually.
I think most girls have a fantasy about waxing some blokes legs.
.
Oh!
Ooh er!
Baby!
Martin has his waxed.
He was very brave.
No one would wax mine.
Really?
Not many places will wax men's legs.
I dunno why, but in a way
Yeah, Gill can do it.
The sports centre'll do it.
It's yours.
You're making me feel really guilty.
Stop it!
I'll be afraid that they can see my tummy.
No!
You can't, you can't see, you can't  you could cover your legs with it though 
A bit.
couldn't you?
Yes, well keep your pants on, that's all I can say.
What are you doing?
What did you say you were doing Sunday?
I thought you might have forgotten about me Doug.
No.
I don't know.
What am I doing?
Has Martin said what I'm doing already?
And where is it?
No, well Martin looked through the diary.
Where is it?
It's at Potter Street.
You're going as well are you?
What's that?
This thing on Sunday?
Wahey!
No I'm gonna watch my wife on the hillside .
Oh I see.
I thought she was 
Yeah.
going too.
Can you not er  bring her along afterwards?
She'll be really chuffed .
Erm, I don't know what I'm doing actually.
That's very helpful of me isn't it?
I shall ask Martin 
How's it going Doug?
when it gets a bit nearer.
Pardon?
How's it going?
Well, it's not very good actually.
But I still have to put some of the blinds out again.
What happened to the one I did last year?
The last time I did  you put me on blind bends.
Did I?
And then said afterwards, I put you there cos they stop for women and not men.
So I 
Hey?
had to throw myself in front of a speeding car!
Stop!
Ha aargh aargh!
The legs  .
You trod on my bloody foot!
At least I wasn't wearing a stilettos.
True.
That's the one where I marshalled with you last year actually wasn't it?
Yeah that's right.
That's right.
And you came, you came and tied his dog to the back of my car.
Yeah.
They're gonna 
And the 
run away with it !
and then wrote himself a note to remind himself to untie the blooming thing.
Oh yes .
Dear Doug
Don't forget to untie the dog.
And you can just imagine him rid 
You can.
driving away with it
Absolutely.
Woof!
Nicely  then followed the car.
Yeah, true.
It's easy.
I don't .
But then you start to overtake him   seventy miles an hour or so.
Dog's yapping.
Yeah.
Well I reckon that erm  Andy  ought to sort mine out.
And he's rowing with that blonde chick.
And you're so jealous?

Walkmans have a built-in speaker something like that.
Yes.
But I thin, this one hasn't so 
I can put it all down .
Are you following it?
Did you hear it on the radio this morning about the research that the , these people are doing?
No.
They were talking about language on Radio Four and erm  what people e , it isn't anything to do with the training course we're on, it's the language.
It's nothing to do with T N T or anything er  at all, it's just  er they that organization has wro written to a number of large companies and asked them to  er  record er, so many, er tapes so they can analyse it.
But really they're looking at the  the er sounds you're making and the language you're using rather what, they're not interested in what we're saying.
what people?
What age?
on me.
What is it for?
And I won't ask you what situation 
you were in when you found that out.
Right.
Let's have a look at what yo , who's gonna represent us on the old er  features and benefits this morning?
Phil.
It's gonna be Phil.
Oh right Phil.
Elected.
Good old Phil.
Okay.
What did we 
have?
Good of you to volunteer Phil?

Yeah.
Erm  on the first one it's the before nine service  er basically 
Yeah.
a benefit for the customer that it is a guarantee before nine.
Erm  it is obviously beneficial particularly for banks and financial institutions to use 
In what way?
Well they start work quite early and they can get cheques processed erm  situations like that.
Yeah.
So what 
And then 
what, what's the benefit then?
Just, what is the benefit.
It's there at the start of a new day.
See
It's there somehow.
that's the benefit?
Describing the feature is only describing the feature.
Mhm.
Before means, nine, means your getting it there before nine you said and er, that means it's there nice and early.
That's describing a feature .
Mm.
The benefit of getting it there early  and  a little leap word which takes you from a feature to a benefit
Which means
Well done.
Which means that  so you have to make 
Ah ah .
it into sentences by a little leap word
Actually I've got it on here but I just don't like saying it all the time.
I've got a 
Ah ah!
I've got it on top of bank though.
Okay.
Right.
Before nine
You just wrote that though.
Eh?
You just wrote that.
Yeah.
Which means you, that you can start  what was your words Jenny?
So you can start the working day.
means that it's ready for the start  of the working day  giving you a
Eh?
that's the real benefit.
Alright.
There at the start of the working day, giving you, you've gotta say that next step  and tell them, okay, if you can say so what, you haven't told them the benefit.
Okay?
So what?
Let's see how many so whats you can come up with after this.
Okay.
Go on.
So what's the next one?
Again, before ten thirty it is a guaranteed service before ten thirty  which is a benefit.
No.
Before ten thirty guaranteed is a feature.
It is built in by design.
We build that in.
If you build it in by design, like we build this in
and the design  of that was so that it will stay on, built in by design.
And should stay on.
Which means that  what did we say yesterday?
Right.
And therefore helps with your presentation simply.
That's the benefit.
Right.
So, the fact that it's guaranteed that, we've actually built that in by design which makes it a feature.
Mm mm.
What he, what the customer gets out of that is what?
So
Well, on, on the ten, ten thirty one 
Yeah.
I've put it very similar to that of the nine o'clock one  really.
Which it , it is.
It's still 
Yeah I've I 
the elements of time really, yeah?
That's it.
It's just cos I , I couldn't do a lot more about that one.
What other things , what other things other than giving them actually 
Cheaper.
They're paying less 
Well it's , it's an option 
and they might 
as well isn't it?
They got an option.
sometimes get it before 
Nine.
nine.
Yeah.
It gives them, what does, what does options give you?
A choice.
A choice.
It's choice, and I feel I'm, I'm able to choose  what does that make me feel?
Good.
In charge.
In charge.
Can I use the word control now then?
Yeah?
You're saying in charge is sort of like, I am in charge which is like this.
It is if you make the customer feel they are literally 
That's right.
Yeah.
in charge of their 
Now 
service.
They like that.
I like to know what's happening.
Yeah.
Adrian 
Yeah.
said look Ka Kath, gotta get to Plymouth tonight, I need to know.
Cos you, here he needs to know as well, don't you?
You sit here today knowing that something's gonna be done.
Because it couldn't wait until lunchtime and that, that's perfectly understandable because he wants to feel in control of what's going to happen to some degree, rather than just be at the mercy of someone else's position.
He wants to be part, you know, influence that decision, and that's important to all of us isn't it?
To know where we stand.
You know people say, I like to know where we stand.
I like to know whe , know where I stand.
People love the feeling of being in control.
And the before nine guarantees, just give them the time factor again.
Er, that enables that they choose how much time they need, er because it, do I need to go that time or that time?
And that gives them control.
And as you say  it's one of the best things that they want.
Because, when you subcontract it out, has anybody changed hairdressers?
Or changed banks?
Use a service where they've changed before now?
Mm.
Was there an element of risk involved?
Were you a bit concerned at the time making the decision?
Worrying about what might happen?
And everybo , when you contract out something, when you ask someone else to do something for you.
Ooh oh!
There's just that  doubt.
Obviously, repeat experiences, good ones, gives you peace of mind.
But what I'm saying is, it's this that you really want.
And becau , that's one of the most valuable benefits you can give a customer  time and control.
Any more?
Yeah the er, the noon one.
Mhm.
You're fo , guaranteed 
Oh yeah.
before noon.
Oh sorry.
The noon, yeah.
Again, we come into  which means that  what?
Well it's, I put down on here that er, it's a benefit for customers that possibly their shops close half day where they can have collections, er sorry deliveries in the morning  so that they've got benefit of having deliveries A M 
Right.
only.
Well done.
Again, we're back to  being involved 
Choice, yeah.
and choice.
Well done.
Yeah.
And als , erm  and on them three services is what we said a few moments ago, they got the choice of three different options.
Right.
So that the 
Really , you're giving them time and control and it's up to you, it's an alternative choice on the whole thing.
I dunno whether a price would be a feature or a benefit.
I mean it's gotta be 
I think 
a benefit
Yes.
to them.
Be , yes certainly.
But obviously people always receives the choice doesn't it?
If, well it's a value judgement they make isn't it?
But I don't think selling price saving is a, I don't think putting money up front first is a good idea.
No.
Because if you put it up front first, what do we now discuss everything around?
Money.
Money.
That's right , yeah.
D'ya see what I mean?
That dictates.
That's right.
What I'm saying is, you always assume that that is people's  er albeit, which it is obviously isn't it?
But 
You're detracting from the real issue of their needs.
That's right.
That's right.
Why, I mean it might not be worth anything, I mean, you know, it's a value, you can't, you can't start influencing them about money to early, because it's the value benefit of that  that they're really looking at.
So I would keep money well out of it.
Last thing innit, really?
Yeah.
Because when he makes out  mu ,bi how much is this worth?
Is what, is where the money thing is coming in  not, how much he saves on the level of service.
And then he makes a value judgement.
Is it worth it?
No.
You get a taxi sometimes don't you?
To places.
You don't have to go in your own transport.
What's the deciding factor?
Are there special taxis?
Mhm.
No.
Is it worth it sometimes?
Yeah it is.
Would you use it as an everyday mode of transport?
Yeah.
Mm mm.
You see what I mean?
Some people do.
Some people get taxis everywhere.
Do their shopping  with a taxi .
Because for some people  there may be a value judgement made about it.
I don't know.
But what I'm saying is, is that everybody makes their own value judgement and be careful that you're not making, imposing your value onto them.
Th they're free to judge.
Yeah?
Next one?
Saturday  Saturday delivery.
Right.
Erm, again it's an option for them to have if need be.
Er, but I've put down here that erm  but possibly some retail outlets  although the Saturday is the busiest day of their week they might important merchandise  to arrive particularly at, you know, Jaeger shops, expensive shops  where like the price of the item warrants paying a Saturday surcharge.
Alright.
So certain areas can have delivery Saturday.
What are the things apart from the value of the item ones in erm  you're right  Phil, by the way I'm not saying you're wrong.
The urgency of the package.
Convenience.
If a restaurant needed a microwave cos they're open all weekend  they couldn't wait till Monday.
Well what about erm  working weeks  for industry and  commerce.
A lot of 
Six
a lot of factories 
Yeah.
do open on a Saturday 
That's right.
and they don't actually do collections, they don't actually do, do any production.
What do they do?
They do all the 
Cleaning.
clean up on a Saturday.
Right.
I've put that down.
Mhm.
Put that 
Right.
down.
Mm mm mm.
Cos
That's what we want.
Obviously, it's again, it's control so, so  a Saturday delivery 
could give you the benefit of erm  reduce down time.
Have you heard that expression?
When, if a production line is going and the production breaks down  but er  if we can reduce our time, has anybody worked in a  in a, er, a co , an industrial environment on, what sort of cost saving could you 
Well 
say er, a  production of say two hours would be where you worked, would you know that time?
Er er
On a production line?
choo choo choo choo choo choo
Er, to give some, but none of us have worked in that environment and it's not something we're familiar with.
To be honest it's really difficult to put a cost to that.
Hundreds or thousands.
Er, thousands.
Thousands.
I mean we're talking big numbers an hour aren't we really?
Yeah.
In the steel industry we'll probably 
I mean 
talk in terms of both.
Tens of thousands
per hour?
Yeah.
Terry?
Yeah?
So what I'm saying is, is getting a delivery  if you can't get something there in time  I mean, it may mean that you know in advance that you need something done and you can deliver in a normal working week, but maybe it's inconvenient in a normal working week.
Maybe, there's nobody really there, maybe it's engineer brought on site.
Yeah.
Because you're not, although you're using the  power space, the power er er of the production line or equipment, they might not be, that might not be what you're making, you're just using that kit and you need the supplier of that kit to bring an engineer in and you need to get a part of it, but you want control of that rather than just waiting on a supplier to do it for you.
Yeah?
Mm.
And that reduces our time.
We are now talking  a few over there.
It may be making 
Quite  quite often you tend to find in industry where  er, if you're dealing with mechanical bits and pieces
Mhm.
if you've got one bit that can't work without another bit, and the bits can be relatively cheap, say may only be about twenty P a bit, but if the twenty P bit doesn't arrive to work with the other bit
One of the
then it's worth  twenty thousand .
I suppose it'll be  into your .
.
Well said Andrew.
Do you know what this is?
Mm.
Well that's a bulb, you need one without the other, so  if that doesn't arrive so you're knackered.
What do you reckon it's used for  that?
What do you reckon it's used for?
That sort of thing.
Probably used for machinery  
Yeah.
If I looked on one of your er  account  entries, it would probably say  fastening.
Now to me, what's a fastening to you?
Zip.
A zip.
Zip.
Mm, yeah.
A button.
A button.
Yeah.
But fastening is a complete industry.
It's how we've, on the actual er vehicles  there is actual metal fastenings that's holding the whole trailer together.
Rivets.
Yeah.
Rivets, or fastenings.
Right?
This'd probably be used for  a construction of some sort I would imagine.
Would you?
Maybe er
Bolting tasks.
Bo , holding machinery through er a base of some sort.
Yeah.
Some, I mean  it's the sort of item that people probably buy hundreds of to hold items down with or construct something, er er put something together right?
How much do you reckon it's worth?
Not, not a lot.
Be interesting , ha?
About four pound.
I don't think it will be but 
Four pound.
Which bit's worth more than the other two?
The bolt is.
Yeah.
Do you 
Either.
reckon they sell them like that?
D'ya think they  some people buy  cos they need more  oops  because they need more of these than these at some time?
No.
Or, they maybe replacing some of these but they got plenty of these, or they're replacing some of these but they've got plenty of these?
Yeah?
I reckon that you'd probably buy those cheaper than this item because of the raw materials would you say?
Yep.
I mean
Plus that's a lot, lot smaller.
They probably come in sets, yeah?
Or people order them together, yeah?
If you were ordering hundreds  and hundreds of these would you put, express them through a parcel delivery service?
No.
Someone else here.
Well probably not, no.
Would you probably ,
Well no.
how d'ya reckon people buy these?
How are they delivered?
At a time.
Box.
Box.
They probably get them on pallets and stuff like that.
Tell them to ring back?
Yeah.
And er 
so, if I was to walk into the place that was selling these
Hello.
what sort of picture have you got of the environment I'm in?
She will call you back.
Industries.
It's in a heavy industrial warehouses, they're, they're, they're 
they're probably pressing these out at quite a rate of knots aren't they?
It's  er Bob  student they've asked to interrupt the .
Oh!
Oh well I apologise for that then.
You'll need a  then won't you?
Shall we go up?
Apologise for this.
Hello .
You can carry on.
Where were we?
Where were we?
Construction engineering manufacturing.
Construction engineering.
Oh, well I think we've got to the point haven't we, where these are probably cheaper than the bolts.
And they're
Hello.
they bolt like this in pairs 
Hello?
How did you get 
as, as a pair.
then ?
but what tends to happen?
Probably if you'd brought something from M F I.
You got one missing.
Missing.
You got one missing.
You got, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what usually goes missing?
The bolt.
Nearly always the nuts.
Mm.
So er, what we've got is a situation where somebody's ordered maybe a couple of thousand of these
But no nuts.
but they want, no, they've got the nuts as well.
But inevitably they've been sort of thrown in a corner and people have fiddled around with them like I've fiddled around with this and we find we got what, twenty or thirty of these missing.
Now, we're talking about a totally different situation.
The weight is different  the numbers are
significantly less  and so you might well consider  the need to use this means 
we, can't use them as you were saying earlier Adrian, yeah we can't use one part without the other.
Yeah.
It is necessary.
So, this now becomes very urgent.
And so we might well Express these then or even send erm
I suppose for the construction industry you're then looking at
perhaps when you po produce like the channel tunnel and things 
Yep.
like that, where it's labour intensive that you're paying people maybe thirty, forty, fifty pound a hour
That's right.
And if they're sitting there 
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
on their backsides waiting for nuts 
, you know
Yep.
then it's  not just the intrinsic value of the items themselves
Yep.
It's the  
That's a consequential loss.
In fact you could in 
in  
yeah in fact that's a fir , that's a very good example you see, because in that situation you might well pay more for the carriage than the value of the item
Yeah.
because of the other things that you're losing, er guys sitting 
Mm mm.
on their backsides
Overtime
getting paid whatever it is.
and cost , overheads.
O , other machinery maybe, maybe you're burning electricity unnecessarily because of er having to keep 
To stay warm.
compressors and things running.
Allsorts of costs may well be impinging on this.
So you find yourself  maybe paying well over the price of the value of the item
Mm mm.
just to get it there because it's urgent.
Think of any other examples?
Well clothing might have said, important merchandise, clothing
Yep.
In a place I used to 
Eyes.
work
at least I think at work 
operation Pete is it?
What, what was that Carly?
Eyes.
Yeah.
Course, yeah.
Mo 
Organs.
Most products used in er manufacturing, whether it's in pharmaceuticals, food, industry, er all products that rely on, you know being there on time
Yeah.
to meet, meet that kind of .
I mean, even deadlines isn't it?
Magazine 
Yep.
deadlines.
well my wife's in the rag trade  and  this morning she's got er, a fashion show starting, and I'll bet you, I don't know this, but I'll bet you at least two of her manufacturers  will have sent her samples to put in that show  which probably will arrive at nine o'clock this morning.
Now how they're gonna send them I don't know, but I can assure you they will send them in a hurry.
Cos they were probably putting buttons on, or doing the last stitching 
Last night.
last night.
That's it.
Mm.
Now it isn't,th the value it doesn't matter there.
What they're doing is they're sending it so that somebody will place orders.
And they could find themselves with, you know, somebody asking for a thousand of an item  and it's well worth their while therefore, spending a bit of money getting it there.
That was Adrian's, also, that was Adrian's point.
Exactly Adrian.
Yep.
And this is when you've been on the receiving end of it.
Now, some of us haven't.
I've never worked where I've had to get materials together and  you know, sort things out.
I've worked in advertising.
You see it in the crisp industry, they're all
Yes.
they're all
well
No salted crisps.
We were 
well to be fair, first i 
Times I got that in.
ha , how can I say, what,whe when you're talking about fa , I mean fast moving consumer good are fast 
Mm.
moving off the shelves and into the shop and, what we would do was erm  deli people now do er, stock an order by computer and, and people like Sainsburys were doing that in the seventies, you know, and they would actually work over  er work on erm  data erm, from their computer  and order er erm  you know, okay, they'd be an event at the weekend or something and they'd, they'd of, increase it or something, but they would technically work out exactly what the throughput of certain items were.
And it goes through the till now doesn't it?
Yeah.
Well, yes, they have a comput 
yes they have the computer software.
In my, in my day probably someone did it a little bit off that, different 
Maybe.
but the, but the proce , the, er the, the whole thing works on the same principal but now they're doing it without, with less effort.
Now what I'm saying is, is the retail trade or the sharp end of th , you know,i it's, it's very much, it's staying alive.
If you over stock, you're dead!
You know I mentioned 
Yes.
the manufacturing point, from that end, not from the end- user to get the products, to, to the retail 
Yeah.
outlets, I meant that  
Ye , you're probably right.
But I mean to be fair we used to we, warehouse  thousands of tons of potatoes in Leicestershire, you see what I mean?
We've made 
Yeah.
we make er, you know you feel, ah my factory we thinks looking at 
Like a .
see looked at, looking, looking, look how we treat our potato, aren't they gorgeous!
You know, and tha , we wouldn't go and have a look at a parcel machine system we'd look at lovely potatoes,.
And Marks and Spencers use the same  potato.
Can you just get your girls to wear their hats on each layer and we'll have your potato,the , you know, that's how you used to get the Marks, get their Marks and Spencers account.
A , but what I'm sa ,wha the point you were making Adrian, is tha , is is  that's what you've gotta keep in mind about every time you walk into a business or phone up a business, that it does matter that it's in, your, that's not what we want  cos I'm telling you, you know, don't you know, the security guys  photographing, you know, lampposts and stuff like that.
But if it's a bolt that holds a lamppost down and they've under  under-ordered, there's not, but they're with them, then we can take those.
The other thing is, is docu , documents are the same.
If, there are, there are industry working to deadlines all the time.
I in  Terry was just mentioning his wife's business, in advertising, d'ya, would sell the advertising space in your feature or your magazine or whatever  try and get the bleeders to send you that what they wanna put in it!
A friend of mine sends things like that and they gotta be  and the proofs have to be sent.
Honestly!
You know.
Oh trying to get companies to decide 
how they're gonna say, what they're gonna say, coming up with art work ideas and whatever.
And it was always to,ye , you know, you ask a commercial artist what sort of lead time, that's another, another er  another word that you might come across, because again, you don't want them to speak our jargon but we can speak there's.
You know, if I said to Terry's wife, Mrs , how much lead time do you need to set up your show?
What would she say?
What does sh , what do I mean by lead time?
To set it up , the amount of time it takes her to get it up, be prepared 
That's right.
for it.
what about  we , and if I, if one of her suppliers I asked them, if I said well okay, if we feature your outfit here, how much lead time you ne , do you need from order to production?
What do I now mean?
If I place the order today how much lead time do you want?
What do I mean?
Actually the time from er 
Time.
when the order placed to the, when it's gonna be on the rack and ready.
In i , actually in my shop is what I mean.
Now 
It doesn't work that way in the rag trade that.
Remember I was saying to you about the whole of the rag trade?
I know it's gonna cost sending them by the way.
Mhm.
And the rag trade was  also upside down ready on the trailer to come across, I won't bore you with the way they do their budgeting for example, but what happens is, my wife will go to one of those suppliers and say  yes, a number of my people want to buy that dress so we want a thousand of them.
And I want them on, such and such a day.
Alright.
That's no problem.
It's not 
Fine.
how long does it take you, what's your lead time?
So really what's the, what
You get it there on time.
What, what you're saying is, is the lead, if I ask that question then now they would say,tha when, when do you want it?
That's right.
It's like, if you go  to, I've heard, I've not been, but if you go to Hong Kong, you can have a suit made overnight.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's a tailor-made, handmade suit that is stitched
Mm mm.
overnight.
And shirts.
And shirts 
made.
In Thailand while you wait.
Cos they will just say, they'll just sit down and make it.
Measure you up  make it cos they want  the money.
Cos, that's what they need.
Because labour, there's loads of it  and it's very cheap.
And really, what the rag trade's famous for is labour, very cheap.
And that's why they can
Stretch it.
That's right.
And that's why they can 
You've been watching House of Elliot.
What I'm saying is, that's why they respond in that way, which, in in other industries and comp , businesses, er, we have different er, things to consider don't we?
Like arranging where they're bought and so on.
Now T N T do something, when d'ya want it?
We'll get it there.
We'll get it there.
Because, I mean, if we can't do it through T N T overnight i , if tomorrow's too late who do we use?
And if they say well, we want erm  seventy five different locations served with crisps stands by ten o'clock tomorrow because our advert is going out  on national T V tomorrow  can we do it?
Yeah.
And we then go and recruit, we'll go the, you know, we'll go to the job centres and get them.
Mm.
Or, they'll turn round, if the money's, if the money is big enough, they'll turn round to anybody who works for us and say, d'ya wanna join us?
Come and join us.
Get your kit on and do a bit, d'ya know what I mean?
And they'll just ask people to partake and we'll get it done.
If it's, if it's, feasible we'll get it done.
And that's the sort of ethos that T N T's got.
But we're likely to make more money at it than  perhaps the sweat shops do.
So what I'm saying is, is lead time in lots of business is highly valuable  but  if you can cut down the delivery time and give them more lead time  you're actually extending 
Yeah.
the lead time by tightening up and this is where your time deliveries come in.
Because, although it's before nine  erm, the next morning  erm  you're actually giving them now more lead time, you've given them another day because an , sometime tomorrow  you know, if it gets there at two o'clock and it's off-loading in in in at the bay and someone checks that it's been received and then someone makes a phone call to tell them it's there, and then they're doing something else, and then they come down and have a look at it, how many boxes do you think are sitting on loading bays that don't get looked at for a day or two, or three, or four, five  when they've had a next day service?
Quite a few.
Quite a few.
Mm.
My other half ordered from a catalogue disc drives to assemble compu , er a home computer  and he was looking very carefully cos computer parts can be quite expensive and he was looking at national catalogue for the best prices.
He knew exactly what he wanted, or, or the range of things he wanted, and the price that he, he was price conditioned and working out which was the best price, priced package.
And oh!
Look at that place in Southampton, can do me a disc drive for two hundred quid or whatever it was, I don't know why but I can't remember the price, but let's keep it at two hundred pound, And he phoned them up and said oh your price is very good on that one.
Right.
Yes it is.
There's a lot of people ordering that one.
Okay then, can I have one?
Yes he said.
That will be two hundred pounds plus V A T, plus thirty pounds carriage.
He said  thirty pounds?
That's a hell of a lot to be asking, you know, why is it so much?
Oh it's express.
He said right, oh so I'll have it tomorrow?
He says, no it takes thirty days to get here.
Sorry it wasn't thirty days, ten days to get here.
What service does he need Carly?
I can deliver to you next day, but it takes him ten days to get it here, what service does he need?
Mm?
Before nine.
Before nine.
Mm.
Say it again louder.
Carriage forward.
Carriage forward.
It's called carriage 
Can you 
forward.
co can you explain to those who don't know what it is cos it's 
Yeah.
a, it's a stupid name isn't it?
Carriage forward.
Sounds like the, talk about the horse before the ca , the cart before the horse.
In the first place you've got three companies, A B and C  C's your manufacturer
D'ya wanna draw, do you want to draw it on here?
Yeah, wait a minute.
You got three companies  A, B and C.
Erm  we'll call B the carrier  sort of like the go between if you like  A, is your say, shop  and C is your manufacturer.
Now you may have a customer that comes into the shop  at A and they need something desperately, they walk in the sho , may walk in and say look I need that compact disc player, my life depends on having compact disc player and shopkeeper  no see now we haven't got it.
But what they can do in this case is  the manufacturer's at C, but the manufacturer cannot deliver to the shop until  maybe two weeks time  they can phone us, the carrier, we will then arrange  for someone to go to manufacturer at C, pick it up, bring it to us and then we'll take to the shop.
Right.
All for a charge of course.
Right.
So that gives what, to the shopkeeper?
Control.
Control again.
Now what else we could do, well said 
Customer satisfaction.
that's, that's  that's well said, but we can also do third party 
Third party.
carriage forward 
Oh yeah.
that's why, that's so that we can give the shop his control of supply  which actually like my da , you're saying if it was a computer disc supplier he could have next day delivery to him and then next day delivery to my man.
Mm.
Right?
What we can actually do is suggest to the C, the C D or the computer shop  your manufacturer can send directly to Peter  via us, I then say  via us.
Aye, you'll get the bill.
Mm mm.
But  we will send the bill
To that shop.
you can 
Mm mm.
send them the bill and we'll send them the goods.
They, Peter, if he found out where they were coming from what might he do?
Phone them.
To the supplier.
He might cut out the middle man you see.
Cos he might be able to go straight to the ba , the
Yeah.
Now obviously, we don't 
want to lose his business so we protect him but we don't say  it's coming from there.
We are, we represent him, it's his delivery van 
Yeah.
that delivers to Peter.
And that's third party carriage forward which is even, and Peter's even happier because he doesn't even have to wait two days now, he gets his delivery next day.
And the bill he, that he gets at the same as the time as the delivery, and what's normal credit conditions?
Thirty days.
Thirty days.
So when does the thirty days start ticking by?
We get our money back much quicker.
That's right.
You do.
So instead of waiting ten days for delivery and then the invoice being,tha , you know being delivered with the goods  when you open 
Yes.
it up there's the bill  the bill can be eleven days in advance of that which means improved 
Well that means everybody's happier.
The manufacturer's happier
That's right.
cos he gets his money quicker.
Well done.
The shopkeeper's happier because he gets 
Aha.
his money quicker.
We're happier  because we get paid quicker and the end-user's happier cos he's 
Aha.
got his product quicker.
That is it.
And if the shopkeeper uses our service all the time he doesn't have to carry any stock.
Yep.
Yeah.
Right.
Improved cash flow.
And if he doesn't have to carry any stock  what does that mean with th er in terms of his capital being tied up.
It isn't.
He can do 
He could 
what?
Open 
He could do so something else.
Another shop.
another shop.
Yeah.
D'ya see?
But d'ya know something?
There are businesses out there that don't understand that.
They probably don't even know we exist.
D'ya know, d'ya know
Yeah.
why?
D'ya know why they don't know it exists?
People like shops.
I don't know why it is, no.
Because nobody has target them.
Yeah.
That's right.
Anthony?
I've seen a lot of companies like that 
Honestly.
just recently.
Why, why 
Can I tell you another reason why as well 
Peter rang this computer 
because 
in Southampton and he said we can give you next day this, they won't, they won't enter into it, we can give you next day delivery  but it takes ten or twenty days.
And I bet you, if you look at how many of your accounts are not using carriage forward when they should  you would be amazed.
Existing on your roller now.
And so, why so many don't know about carriage 
I know.
forward
Yeah.
They don't understand.
That's it.
They don't understand what it means.
Th ,ca , what do most people use carriage forwards for?
Just collecting from somewhere else and bringing it back to themselves.
Bringing it back, sending it back.
Yeah.
Invoice them 
let me, the o the other thing we can do is if it's broken  the shop can send it back but the man, the other person pays.
Yeah.
Mm.
That is also carriage forward.
Comes back to the person.
And a lot of our carriage forwards are 
Are 
returns.
Yeah.
And then they put in a claim form.
Or sometimes they've got an account in your name.
And that's why we don't make money on carriage forwards cos we don't sell carriage forwards for the positive reasons, we say, well if they don't want them send them back, or if they're damaged send them back.
Yeah.
Or if you have to have, I used to do it for erm  West Bro , er  Northampton Brewery.
Banson's 
Banson's 
Brewery.
Erm, it was, was Banson Brewery.
Er no it wasn't Ba , Banson's Brewery, erm 
Anson's 
no sorry, I'm I'm in the wrong trade, it was er  gas cylinders.
And we used to send back the erm
The valves.
the valves.
They used to er se , we couldn't carry the empty ga , you can imagine that's not express parcel stuff, but the valves er, would sometimes need er replacing and we would send them a valve and, and while, instead of having any down time, we would give them  you know deliver the spare, have the spare come back for repair.
Do you understand?
Cos there's a lot of this maintenance thing that goes on as 
Mm.
as well isn't there  with businesses?
It isn't just  service doesn't end at the sale,so , a lot of things have to have after-care don't they?
Or 
Mm.
a service contract with them and there's lots of business, repeat business.
Another one we did, er, out of South Wales was hip replacement  kit 
Gosh!
to erm    the hospitals  and erm  they would  appar , I might be wro , I'm sure this is the way she explained it to me cos one of the girls in the branches did explain it to me once, and they said they have a choice of joints, like the doctor would say  er 
New brain.
your due to, you know, you, you were due for your hip replacement.
Right.
And what they would do is have a look and say ooh that's, ooh that's about your size, that's about it.
Right.
They don't make a joint do they, for you, you, you, you and you?
They're all sort of standard sort of size pieces of kit.
Cos it's an engineering job really isn't it?
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
Providing you're looking after the blood supply, I mean, you know, the cardiovascular bit, you know, it's a bit of an engineering job.
So they,th , you, you have a choice of hips, and they also have a bit of saw, a bit of sawing kit and screw in, you know, have delicate screws.
Cos it's, it is pins and stuff isn't it, that makes
Yeah.
the hip work?
So they have little screws to, you know, to go into the bone and little er  delicate instruments which are highly developed instruments and manufactured by certain pattern.
And they actually supply them in special sealed containers, you know, little  cases that er, so, when you're doing a hip job you have a little kit come  from the supplier.
And what they do, is they give them a couple of choices of bo , you know, hip joints to go for and the guy decides, the surgeon decides, does his job and then the kit goes back to the manufacturer again  and then when the, another hospital orders it they make up a, another kit.
Obviously there's a lot of sterilizing going on in the meantime and all this.
But they don't, these tools are used again, and again, and again  you know.
The screws they make are, are to be there in the body  and the parts are in the bodies, but the bits they don't use come back and then they are put back into stock again.
And our service was so good  to hospitals,, that they'd be somebody on the table  well where's the bit?
Mm.
She's just getting her anaesthetic now.
Well where's the bits you know?
And they're ringing up  er  Julie about it, and say Julie  well, they're here.
What's happened?
Because the service was so good  they'd all, you know, they'd forget about the delivery that would be there.
She'd supply them.
So it was there?
Yes.
Already 
Yeah.
there.
And then one day it didn't.
Can't find this bit.
They're always going down for anaesthetic, we can't find it.
Now she's just had a pre-med now.
Right okay.
We can't find it.
Can you find it for me?
Okay then.
Traced it.
But of course it took a little bit of time, an hour or so, and th , the woman came round again, they said can't do you today
can't find the joint.
So, she came back out of er  pre-med, had a nice happy half hour on a bit of valium and came back out of it again.
Went back up to the ward cos there was no bit.
Do you know where it was?
In the erm  gate house  at the hospital.
We had delivered it but they hadn't taken it from the gate house to  you know, normal procedure but they, we delivered it normally but they hadn't taken it to the exact part of the hospital it was going to.
So, Julie sent the patient a bunch of flowers  and sh , and said sorry for the de , for the delay, you know it's there tomorrow, and she had this, she had it done again.
But really, what, all they wanted to do was save face from the hospital because it wasn't our fault  but she used a bit of  you know, we won't embarrass the hospital  we'll say 
And then our customer's happy.
bit of customer care, but really 
And, well 
we all, we'll lose face with the patient
Mm mm.
because we int gonna, we haven't gotta worry about what she says about, but he sa , the hospital didn't wanna lose face, but I mean, the hospital said thank you .
Cos they were saying will they tell her, you know the part hasn't come and, so we said okay, let's pretend the part didn't get there.
Send her a bunch of flowers.
But really it had got there but again  But what I'm saying is, that service  of carriage forward  we were making almost as much money on the kit coming back  cos we could have charged another
It's five quid isn't it?
Yeah.
It's five pound at the moment is it?
It has been up to nine or ten pound  for 
Mm.
return.
Because it ca , most, we do lose a lot of money on carriage forwards.
If I talk to, if you talk to our operations they will say, oh my God!
Do you know why?
Because, we don't know what we're carrying.
A lot of carriage forwards 
are returns and damages.
Mm.
And they're in a terrible state when we pick them up.
Because, you can imagine working for us, you received something and thought that's no good and can't use it, what happens to it then in your warehouse or  despa 
Just sta , lays there.
And what happens to it while it's ?
Kicked around.
Kicked around.
Kicked about.
Right.
Broken.
Broken and all that.
And, what did you say that we get a lot of claims on carriage forward?
Damaged foodstuff.
You have to insure them don't you, carriage forward of course?
Yeah.
That's why we have to
So 
No you don't.
Yeah.
Tha that means we're paying out 
But you see the problem is 
if we do actually find out.
Yeah, you see the trouble is though we're so open to abuse.
because
Yeah.
people, they don't rush back, they don't wanna urgently express back a carriage forward, they don't work.
What they want is, they get on the phone and say that's no good, send me another one.
And we send them the replacement, and they let the broken one sit there.
How many times have you  supposed to have taken something back  or have it repaired or something and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there  and it's collected du , I've got things round the house that I've been working on and that I've gotta, I've gotta  and it's collected dust.
You know, that's another project that went sort of slowly the way.
Erm, and what I'm saying is, we don't address the things that aren't urgent 
Yeah.
we only address the urgent things.
But we do leave 
Yeah.
ourselves, well we've gotta protect ourselves as carriers against other people saying  ah!
We broke that, or that was broke  er, but we'll blame the carrier now and look at it, then our security guy goes out and they know it's been sitting around someone's  you know, it's been there for months!
And er, we we, we are open to abuse on them.
But that doesn't mean to say that what Danny said  was very valuable, and as you said Adrian, the four, the four parties, the receiver, the thirty party receiver, the people who are paying the bills  buyer and us are very happy in many cases with  using carriage forward in a positive way not just for returns 
Mm mm.
yeah?
The returns do get a bit dodgy I find.
But we still do it  cos we insure it, we, charge an extra fiver every time  then it's good money.
I'm stopping you through your list  Phil.
Well I mean, I've got a 
Any more?
quite a few on here.
Is there any ones that you want me to pin point at all or 
Erm le , what I wanna do is just get, just insure that we know the difference between what is giving the customer the, the benefit and the features.
So we probably won't go through them all.
But 
No.
let's just discuss our way round a couple of other things because these are, this is your product knowledge now isn't it?
Yeah.
This is what you need to know about selling the service.
It's no good, er  talking about how you do something, how you do is not what they're interested in.
So whats, that's how you do it.
How do you do it?
the customer.
It's, it's what can please me.
Cuddly toy .
What's in it for me?
The with them factor.
What it is in it for me?
Okay.
I've got liability options.
What d'ya mean by that, liability options?
Well like being insu , like people have got a choice of different options of insurances and 
That's a good one.
Now if I said, ooh!
We offer good liability options.
We can give you  transport liability at, what level's that?
Aha.
Five thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, and fifteen thousand pounds costing three, three, six, and nine pound respectively.
Five, ten, and fifteen.
Which is forward transit .
Don't be like that.
What is the free?
Fifteen pounds a kilo.
Sorry, five, sorry I got that one.
Three,
Six and nine.
Six and nine.
and nine.
And the free one is?
Fifteen pound a kilo.
Right.
Okay.
Now what I'm saying is  we, because we have good liability what can that imply?
You're getting a  
How can you sell it's properties then?
In the likely event
In the likely event 
In the likely event 
Likely event so
Well we won't  us, it won't graduate any 
but does it have to do got this  
You're committed 
liability?
you're committed, you're committing to your service 
It's like life assurance.
on the fact that you can offer you your high rate of liability.
Cos by offering a high rate of liability it's, it's suggests that we
Concerned.
that we care.
And say we co , we, we're committed.
Rather than see non-damaged  if you like.
We're limited  I won't ta , I don't like using the word problems without .
The reason why 
What about the 
we can afford to offer such good liability cover is the risk is very minimal.
Is small, yeah.
The cost is very minimal.
Yeah.
Mm.
That's what you're saying isn't it Adrian?
Yeah.
Good.
We can get excellent 
Try to find the words but you had a good, good case there.
We can get excellent rates from insurance companies 
That's right.
because we are so good.
Now we , actually
Yeah.
we are our own
I know about this.
inge , we're our own  which means that we are, our problems are so limited  that we actually carry the liability ourselves, we don't even have to use an external  company  to get the rates on.
We are so , so what I'm saying is, we can afford to offer marvellous cover  because it's, because erm, the risk is minimal.
Dixons Starsfield got er, the same as ours really, got  .
Who does?
Who does?
Dixon Starsfield, Dixons, Currys.
Right.
Where they, they offer extended five year warranties.
Now the chance of you actually needing a 
Yeah.
five year warranty on a T V is .
That's right.
They generally don't go well.
My friend li , my friend offers a lifetime guarantee on his leather furniture.
Lifetime.
But the way
It's a  it's not .
It's a ex , it's an extra selling point that's what 
It's like when when 
Exactly.
you sell me a  
When you go to buy it you think oh I've got a life I can change it.
you take out, I think most people take out 
life insurance 
Don't you?
you don't expect to die but you just cover every 
That's right.
eventuality.
That's right.
That's the pitfall.
But what 
Yeah.
what what the insurance salesman do is do wobble you a little bit so that you will take it out, you know, can you afford  down, if you were forty having a heart attack leaving a wife and young child behind.
I mean, they do tell you, they sell on that way don't they?
Yeah.
Yeah well they do 
To sell, sell them.
they sell you som something to do with it.
You say that, that is negative.
Cautionary tales.
Yeah.
You know when somebody's at, when someone's at a lowest point, that's when they go straight in 
Anything for a sale.
Yeah.
and you get them to make a will afterwards.
It's co 
you see salesmanship is applying psychology, you know, and a lot of people, I mean,wha the reason why insurance companies are justified is a lot of people are protected by it, you know.
You don't always know what's good for you, you do need someone to say.
Mm.
And you're twenty one 
Can you explain it to me again Kath
Mhm.
about the options there please?
Right.
What is it that you are, you don't understand?
Well I understand that you get fifteen, it's just that I've got a lot of customer where I got  business that is depending on the kind of insurance that we give them, based on what our 
Yes I understand.
competitors are offering.
Erm, the fifty P, P a kilo up to fifteen thousand, that I
Yeah.
That's pro-rata.
Yeah.
That I understand.
Fifteen pound per kilo.
Oh sorry I co , sorry, fifteen pound 
Yeah.
per kilo  up to 
Pro-rata.
Up to a thousand kilos.
which is, yeah, that I
That's
that I understand.
So, if it only weighs kilos you will get how much cover?
Thirty quid.
Er thirty, thirty quid.
Yeah.
You understand that, right?
Yeah.
Now 
But when you got to the options, now 
The full liability, yeah?
what are you saying now fi , up to five thousand pounds?
Per item, per per assignment.
Right.
Regardless of weight.
What's that, what  right 
You're buying a  aren't you?
You pay three pound extra
Oh extra?
Yeah.
On top of your own 
On top of 
Oh that's right.
on top of the fifteen pound per 
No.
kilo?
No.
On top of whatever 
No, no.
price the customer's paying.
Customer's rate.
How do you achieve a rate 
Sorry can, can anyone 
say if you 
can 
well 
I just say
he doesn't pay fifteen pounds a kilo Adrian, he pays nothing.
He pays the rate you  ask him to pay
Yeah.
and, inbuilt in that rate  Mr , is fifteen 
Oh I see.
pounds coverage for every kilo of weight.
That's right.
So if you have a thousand  kilo pallet  it's fifteen thousand pounds.
But if your item weighs a half a kilo, we'll round it up to the first kilo so that's any valid for fifteen pounds.
Right.
Now obviously that's worth a lot more than fifteen pounds to you isn't it?
Right.
So what I suggest you do is pay an additional three pounds which means that that is now covered  for up to five thousand pounds regardless of it's weight.
Right.
Now I understand.
Are you happy with that Adrian?
Yeah.
Now, the reason 
Yes, yes.
why you give them different options  right.
Thank you.
On, on, on the same day they only charge nine pound and i , everything's valid up, insured up to fifteen thousand pounds per consignment.
Are you happy,yo you happy with that then?
In actual fact, sorry to point it, that's consignment contracts   .
Right.
But yo ,
So 
i I haven't, you know, it, because when you read it it doesn't always make, it goes in there, and I understand 
Right.
people getting a little bit confused about that.
But, that just means the levels of insurance, as a risk, ah, you know, and we've just put a rate in to, to represent the, the levels of insurance because  we charge you more if we insure you for more then.
Erm 
So if I've got a customer that's sending erm  quite a lot of parcels but have got a 
Now parcels, have , what is the, what is the, what is the erm definition of a consignment?
Cos this is regarding consignment.
When is a 
Ah ah sorry , it's   
So , what I'm saying is 
it's solely for, it's erm  i ,yo you could have six or seven parcels all picked up in one consignment if it's picked up by that carrier 
By one carrier.
going to one address at one time.
So that's one consignment.
Now if say, let's 
So it's one consignment.
keep it 
so 
to a dozen.
Okay, so you got one consignment 
You've got a dozen items  I want a dozen items
Yeah.
Which is made up of one consignment.
One consignment.
You're only covered per consignment, so the whole twelve together are only insured for fifteen 
Ah ah, ah!
thousand.
Aha.
What he must do
Is make sure that each individual box
becomes a consignment.
Ah ah.
He's got to label up and pay for  at a consignment rate each item.
He 
Cos 
can't
I understand.
Can he put that on his er, consignment 
or 
note?
Can he actually  put a, a tick o on a box, you know when you fill in a consignment note?
Yes.
D'ya know when yo , d'ya know when you put one on each parcel
You write a co sep separate consignment number 
Yeah.
for every consignment.
If if the customer feels that every item he's sending out
Is valuable.
is er is valuable, can he do, I dunno. a dozen individual consignment notes and then tick the particular box 
Yeah.
that he wants?
That would work out 
Yeah.
then 
That one.
because he's gonna pay
Yeah.
he'll be paying  
If that's what he wants.
Yeah, that's it.
If he needs five thousand pound coverage on each item 
On each one.
He's gonna, he's gonna have to pay for it.
he's got to send five, if you've got a twelve  well twelve percent.
Now, can I put it another way Adrian?
I'm just trying to get an edge on my competitors
Right.
cos, I 
Let me put it another way then.
This is only what we publish.
If you know the value of the level of insurance your client wants
Right.
and if he wants to send them as one consignment, but now the value is twenty five thousand pounds  collectively  you can ring up Stubbings  and as , or get your F and A to do this for you, Finance and Admin, ring up Stubbings and can you give me a special rate for these goods and ar , can you give me what I can charge them for special coverage to take it higher than our normal coverage of fifteen thousand pound?
Oh I see.
Now what they will wanna know is the ins and outs of everything that you're sending.
How delicate it is,
As most insuring company,mos most brokers or people like that.
how value it is, and most insurance, yeah, that's right through a brokers.
Would you have to send in a profile?
Do you have to send it in?
Yeah.
I've never done it but I think you do have to send that in.
And can I please recommend you speak to your finance and admin people and they will say, now don't expect to be saying, oh that'll be no problem, because we na , we ain't got a F and A like that, they're always to caution, you know.
They're all  
Yeah.
don't think you can do that son !
You know you'll get this thing, don't worry, say okay
Cor!
Now ,do we?
We don't know.
Been looking everywhere.
I dunno.
Anywhere er
Who would call ?
My husband
Er erm, you, you couldn't, could put a call through.
Can't.
Er, well you could leave a message then?
No.
Well done Jenny.
Very good.
And just all the right format 
Yeah.
of questions there.
How did it feel about ringing and asking questions that were  ?
Did it throw you a bit did it?
Yeah.
I mean really you're saying 
I could 
I can't think of anywhere to go,my God!
I mean , she's saying well  what do you exactly mean by this question?
I mean, I wasn't  the world you know.
Now
Erm
did she hesitate for some time before the answers?
Yeah.
Mm mm.
and what did Jenny do when she hesitated?
Lis listened.
She did, but she did something else as well.
She went ha!
She went off .
She went
Mm.
Everything.
And you say ooh, come on, come on.
Come on  
Have I said the wrong th 
Did you feel a bit uncomfortable when she hesitated a bit then?
Mm mm.
You we , and it feels like that when you're on the phone.
Now all she was doing
now you can see that  you can read those messages about  the hands went didn't they?
The shoulders went, the face went long.
Mm.
Ooh!
Er, oh!
You could see her thinking about it, but you couldn't have heard that on the phone.
Yeah, you do get silences like that sometimes don't you?
And you get silences on the phone  and you're thinking  this is going down like a lead balloon.
No!
She's engaging brain  it takes her some time to come out to the phone  instruct the whole thing.
Yeah?
Don't worry about it,ta , the pregnant pause 
is to use.
On a moment's thought for them to sort of.
Did you feel the pressure of having to ask the questions till then, when, when they were asking you to do it to to plans?
Very much so.
Yes.
And you will feel like that and you sit there   Oh God!
I've gotta do that .
Yeah.
Preparation, good preparation will help that.
Relax, Jenny, relaxation will help that as well.
Just
Mm mm.
breathing calmly and waiting.
And, when she said  anywhere  was that enough information really?
Do you really wanted to know where Jenny had, where Mandy had been on holiday?
No.
Would,wo , would you liked to have known more?
I would have.
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How could you prompt her to expand on that?
Er 
Could you give me a few examples?
Well done Paul!
That's, oh yeah, how did i , repeat the question,an an and emphasize on the word.
Mm.
Could you give me an example?
Now if you say it in an ex , in a, in a  do you want to give me a few examples?
You're a bit Yeah.
All she'll say, no I 
No.
can't.
If you say  ah!
Neil says you've been everywhere, what are the type of things, that you know, you can use tone and voice cos they can't see you.
It's all in the voice what you put into voice.
Bill had  the opportunity to sit face to face with them and  you catch his eye, you you used to  er  time to  er use, use hand gestures and show things to them on, on presenters.
You haven't on the phone.
Can you give me a few examples?
Could you expand on that a little?
We what was your question Phil?
Yours was a good one.
Aha.
Where have you been?
Yeah.
Th the, the fall on the, the repeatedness , the broken record that sort, when you repeatedly question.
Ah!
Where have you been?
Oh I've been to, or you rephrase it in another way.
Well done.
Very good.
And don't lose, just because she said  I wanted to know, they didn't answer me.
Stick with it.
Even if it means a few phone calls.
What exactly do you mean by that?
Sorry, I've never worked in your industry, why is that?
Yeah?
And follow it up with a new question.
So the experiences, although it's got nothing to do with your product, is what is gonna actually happen to you on the telephone out there.
Yeah?
Mandy, would you like ask Jenny a question?
Yeah.
Erm  how long have you been driving?
Two and a half years.
So when did you learn to drive then?
When I was seventeen.
And what were your ideal car?
Er a Rover .
So I give you the choice of a, a Lamborghini or a Rover what would you rather have?
A Rover I think then.
Ah.
So if I let you drive my Rover home, would you?
Definitely.
Yeah .
And if I let you drive my Rover home, would you?
She said yes to the actual question.
That was more than a closed question, it was closed
Oh right.
would you?
You said would you drive my Rover that's the question?
When you said  we'll talk about that question last.
And the others will have to wait till they come up again.
Ah ah!
Right.
Well done.
See that, excellent.
Right.
How did it feel Jenny asking a load of questions?
Straight out  weren't they?
Yeah, when she was saying asking them 
And the, that's right.
Now, the other thing is Phil  because he's got a new experience with it, struggled to find a question.
Right, he knew what she was talking about, she'd got it written down and she was gonna get that information.
But sometimes it can sound too  I know this didn't happen
Yeah, comes a bit too 
it's just  
I mean I'm not suggesting you, you behave like that on the phone
but what I'm saying is, awareness now, I'm just slagging off the awareness.
When it sounds rehearsed, it sounds, like, that.
And it doesn't sound quite as clear as if you have to think about who you're talking to.
So the fact that you struggled Phil 
Mm mm.
to find the next question, the customer knows you're thinking.
Ah  that's interesting.
Try and get that now  buy yourself a bit of time
Mm.
think about that.
Let me , let me think about that.
Do you mind if I come back to you on that one?
And if you can't stand the heat  get out quick  and come back to it.
But it, eventually it will sta , you'll think afterwards, oh God!
I didn't know  the next thing.
Analyse what you did
Sure.
then think about it, and there's always another call.
Yeah?
No problem at all.
Okay.
Now, that was very well done .
No problem at all there.
Paul, would you like to ask Carly a question?
I didn't understand it.
I've done three questions of each.
Oh God Paul !
Do you understand it now?
No I, no I understand what you're saying, it's just that I thought you said three questions of each.
I done three open, three limited, and three  yes and no questions.
Would you, would you wanna erm, d'ya wanna
No I've crossed them all out now.
Okay.
Go on.
Well away you go then?
Sorry, well I've 
The blurb.
got that one.
My, must be my mistake.
Well I thought you would have got it in black and white.
I got a big 
No go on.
in the mornings.
Go on Paul.
Carry on.
Carry on.
Hello Carly!
Hello Paul.
How long were you seeing your boyfriend then before you married him?
Er, about six years.
About six years.
Whose idea was it to get married?
Both of us really.
Yeah?
Right.
How old were you er when you got married?
Twenty one.
Do you live at home with your par , er your parent's home or erm  do you live in, in your home?
Well currently with my parents because we moved down.
Are your parents ha 
Or moved up I should say, sorry.
erm  are your parents happy with your choice of husband?
Initially  no.
Well  , I was afraid of the answer then.
Well done.
That was a very 
good question Paul.
Yes obviously.
Excellent
Keep you on  .
Excellent questioning Paul there.
Well I did have some more but I thought no I 
Ah, thank God for that!
.
How did you feel about answering those questions?
Fine.
No problem?
No.
Again, speed
But I think erm
Sorry go on.
Sorry.
No.
Answering back  I thought he could have given me a bit more time cos I wanted to say something else and he was 
Ah ah!
That's interesting.
Yes.
You could have got more information Paul!
But I didn't.
Ah I know.
But I didn't 
But just 
want any more.
I thought it was, it was, it was,en en en 
No can I just, can I say 
encroaching on her private business.
the er  yes I know.
I know.
I don't care.
It's only an exercise and, and you 
Yeah.
and you have e , your own agendas there, obviously.
What I'm saying is  is sometimes slowing the pace  and simply 
Yeah.
let her think a little longer because  and then she'll say, oh!
And then she's just think of that.
With Phil's hesitance  we got a bit more.
And Phil was thinking  I wonder whether this is about  and I'm  trying to think of the next question .
No.
Which is the question of what you feel when you're in the field out there trying to work something through.
Which calls 
Actually you've hit the nail on the head there didn't you?
Mm?
When you said  Phil thought he wasn't, I'm not listening.
No.
Because that's what it's all about.
Yes.
And when you're listening you're watching for body language as well.
Mm.
And so if you have not been concentrating on the question
Yeah.
you will probably have recognized the body that says  I'm prepared to give you more.
Now, to be fair  that comes with experience.
Of course.
Listening, as you become more comfortable and you become, you've done it a few times  you know what you're gonna have to say  and then you, you er, you listen more carefully to the answers.
But the listening is the key.
Paul had it well prepared and really she sa , but sh all his answers met with  a logical sequence didn't it?
Mm mm.
Very well done  and he spent a lot of time working on that did you notice?
I'm not saying that's, okay, you got a bit misled by the instructions but don't worry, but he still gave  you could see that  you know  he was, you know, he was just 
Yeah.
you know, he was caught in a 
He was  concentrating .
train of thought.
He was erm , he was trying 
Thanks.
very hard and e , good, good preparation does take effort.
I mean I know we're only playing here, but it does take effort and, practised effort becomes easier  it doesn't become hard work.
It's like  playing a good game of squash, squash, to get a better game  and it's not so hard  because you're off to, you, you're fit for the game.
And that's what you'll do, you'll become fit.
You'll be a better player.
As you say, when you're on the phone you get those silences you just of go, mm mm, mm
Well done Jenny!
And like,
Well erm, what's ha , what would you call those?
Right.
Okay.
They know you're listening.
Listening noises.
That's very good.
That's very good.
Right.
All 
Can I do, just make one announcement?
Yes.
Please do.
Just to illustrate how important this thing is, you've probably all come across and it really irritates me, you see people interviewing people on television  and they've got their clipboard there and they've obviously got a prepared question so they can't falter  and fine, that means they've prepared it.
And they ask a question and somebody's very open with the answer and they da , they just,sa expand on that answer  and then, two or 
Aha.
three questions later they ask them the very question they just answered 
E e expect  
and that really irritates me!
And that's purely and simply because they're just not listening.
Oh.
The easiest thing in the world to take off that question
Yeah.
so that it's
so think about that because 
Yeah.
And you'll lo 
you don't want to get the backs up of your customers by asking them questions .
That is right.
And you'll losing the point of why 
Absolutely.
you're asking the question.
See
Aha.
you're not, you're not paid to ask questions, you're paid to get in , information.
Info.
Yeah?
That's the point.
So that fact that you can't think of a next question Phil
Mhm.
don't worry, you've got some information.
We can all ask questions  later  okay?
What you really want then is a way to sort of happenings or embarrassments because you're a bit stuck of where you want to go.
Mm mm.
That's interesting.
Let me write that down.
Ah!
You're giving yourself some new , you know.
I think one of the things Phil can do in that si 
Don't worry about it.
or anybody could do in that situation is having asked a question, they're a bit hesitant about  er, the next question then simply throw in there to buy yourself some time something like  ee, is that all?
Or, is any more that you can add to that?
Just to give yourself a bit of time
Mm.
Or repeat the question.
for the next question.
It will help 
Yeah.
you.
Like we've just suggested.
Oh have you?
Or, what was your way of doing it before you said?
When, when you wanted to know where Mandy went?
Can you give us, tell us about that Paul?
Well I kept asking her, it made hard work, yeah.
Yeah.
What did you do to her?
You've not been listening have you Paul?
You know whe when, when we asked 
He's still
Well I thought she didn't know that.
No he's still sitting back on his reflected glory now.
And rightly so as well.
Well done.
Carly would you like to demonstrate yours 
Kath.
now?
Er 
Could I say, say something?
Yeah.
I just think  I just think  it's quite important for us all to realize  I did a, when I used to do a similar job to this  it took me a long time before I realized  that the customer, you know on the phone doesn't know that your  you shouldn't have asked an open question there 
Oh.
on the close  and it comes, it just comes with practise, get all 
Right.
from practise doesn't it?
Which is exactly it.
what I'm saying is is, you can, it doesn't matter how you ask the question, but sometimes 
what I'm trying to help you practise, cos we're not, we're very good at asking closed questions in conversations but don't very often recognize, but you know, we, we we we, we'll zip backwards and forwards, and that's okay, but I want you to do consciously is know what type of questions you're asking because you can sometimes be hitting a brick wall and thinking I'm getting anywhere here and it's because you're asking too many closed questions.
Mm mm.
And you're making it sound like an interrogation.
Erm, especially when you're in front of a screen er or you're in front of a, a form that you're, someone's saying get the traffic profile out and th what they send, what they, how many they send, it can sound like an interrogational.
Get the buyer, get the product, get the carrier, get, and so on like that.
You've got to be careful that you are not losing the skill of a conversation.
Mm.
Open question  what th va , advantage of open question is, is you do a  less of it  and they
More of it.
More of it.
And that's why it, on a foundation course we keep the questioning very simple.
Justin's experiences has tooken it, taken it further than that which is brilliant, and he can apply those skills straight away.
And if you've got those skills apply to them job, I'm not suggesting you don't, but remember  the first part of a, a tele , er a telephone or a face to face sales negotiation is,th th two of these and one of these.
Right?
You should you be posing the questions and letting the discussion take place.
Posing the questions, controlling it  but posing it and letting it go.
Right?
And you're gaining information.
When you've gathered information  a , and and come to a conclusion  erm interesting, we may have something for you there.
And that's when you get your presenter out and start matching to what the customer wants.
Now you've gone through an alternative yesterday  and we know, we ta , we don't talk what is built in by design, what do we talk about?
We tell them what's built in by design and then we
Tell them the advantages.
of what they get out of it.
. And we keep it simple.
One feature  maybe one or two benefits  and you don't have to tell them the whole story.
Mm mm.
As you said Bill, pull out the benefits and features that are appropriate to what you've heard.
Er, there may be something you're interested in there?
Now there are tighter ways of actual sales negotiations but we haven't got the time to go into it today.
You'll have to come back on your selli , your course to do this.
Okay?
Or you ca , if you can do it on your own, brilliant!
Run with it now.
But what I want you to do is gather information, this is your answers, and match what you're doing  er, what we sa provide with what you found out then.
Okay.
And you'll find out what method by just simply questioning them  about the .
Let me just check before we start that everybody's got this.
I'm sure Danny, Jenny, and Carly have, but just because  we've gone half way, can I just let the other three finish off their presentation?
Cos they've sat and done the preparation.
Carly.
Okay.
Hello Paul!
Erm, I know you're allergic to food and drink, so you keep on telling me, what sort of food are you allergic to?
Just about everything under the sun.
What sort 
Dairy products  erm   dairy products , oranges  various fruits.
Remember the listening noises.
Right.
Mm.
Yes?
Er, can't think of anything else specific at the moment.
But it's just about, I've got a list at home, it's about this long though.
Right.
Okay.
Erm  do you actually
What type of question is that when you do actually? him.
What type of question 
A minute.
Yeah.
And then, give him a choice like, can you 
A choice .
what were you going to ask Carly?
Do you actually
I was gonna ask him, do you actually eat the products still to a limit?
Right.
Okay.
It's a closed question there.
Right, that's right.
How can you change  ask,ge get to that, but say it as an open question.
If there are limits
No.
That's a closed 
question.
What do they begin with?
Sorry, they're the words which you were .
Which foo , which food do you eat?
Yeah.
They're the words true.
There is nothing to give me 
There was no  last night.
these are open questions.
You said, do you actually eat the products that made you allergic Paul?
Right?
What you're saying  how can ask any of those, any of those sort of questions?
This is a very useful one.
Just by  .
How can you ask but using that word at the beginning of it?
I am allergic to almost an anything.
And you wanted to know do you eat almost anything don't you?
Yeah.
Do you still suffer?
So, what, what word do you make it into an open question?
Can you have them?

No, I'm allergic to everything and I still eat it all.
Yeah.
Going by last night apparently, ordinary roast.

Okay.
Let's get back 
to the point, the point of the questioning.
Carry on Carly.
Go on then.

No.
Are you scared, what type of question?
An open.
Let her work it through for herself.
Oh yeah.

But I'm trying to make her brain work not one of yours.
No, I have got a .

Erm

What was your second, answer to your second question?
Sorry.
I eat lots

I'm allergic to everything but I still eat it all.
That's the information you've got so far.
Right.
Is there a special method of cooking your food at home, not obviously outside?
Now nobody help her at this stage.
Is there a special method?
Wha what, how are you gonna answer that Paul?
No.
Now, what sort of question is it you've asked then?
Closed.

I like most types of music but erm  at the moment I'm, I'm into U B forty, I quite like them.
You say, now  erm  why do you listen to this particular music?
I think my daughter really weaned me onto it.
I didn't have much choice, I wasn't listening to it anyway so then I  got quite to like it then.
Yes, you .
Erm  where do you listen to this music?
Er, it's just at home usually.
So, do you listen to this every day

Excuse me .
I listen to them.

I don't care, I'm not there .
Yeah.
Well done.
Well done.
Lots of informa , I know it's not re , I know we haven't talked about selling T N T, and I'll, your questions aren't really about this time, I'll do that in a minute.
What questions can we ask about T N T, to T N T potential customers?
We asked about music, we asked about food, we asked about holidays, we asked family, we asked about, what was Ja , Mandy's questions to you Jane?
What was your 
Driving.
question?
Driving.
Driving.
We asked about, what was your question to 
Music.
music.
Er, er clothes to Danny.
What questions do you want to know from customers about, what d'ya wanna know about them?
Their business.
About their business.
What about their business Justin?
What is the question that you want  answered?
Do they send goods out?
Do they want a carrier?
Do you use a carrier?
Right.
How regular?
Can we assume that something moves out of most buildings?
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, we can.
What sort of things move out of any  business premises.
Papers
Letters.
or letters.
Documents.
That's right.
Something's likely to move.
So yo , rather , do they send goods out?
Can we assume that one anyway Ju , maybe not goods 
Well I su 
but there's, something moves that needs a delivery 
Mm mm.
somewhere.
Would you, would,wo , I mean, just the way, what made you feel that it wouldn't be the case?
But would you mean 
Well er , well I've, and added two hundred mailers
Mhm.
in like two days and
Yeah.
that's the fir , and you ring up hairdressers and
Mm.
vets and all sorts 
Mm.
so you had to ask them.
Mm.
A couple  
Some people just have, some people will will never have a need for a carrying service.
Yeah.
No, there is some
Are you, sort of 
Okay, you were talking about, you you're talking about your target customers were sort of like abattoirs and hairdressers and stuff like that?
Yeah but you know the mailers that we did, I mean 
Right.
that that 
They were just registered businesses.
we were told to ask
Right.
you know
Okay.
do you ever have a need for a carrier 
Yeah.
at all?
You know before you start giving them all the spiel 
What type of question is that though?
Do you ever have a need 
Closed.
for a carrier?
It's closed.
Yeah.
Cold.
It's, still a  
You have to  open.
How can you ask to that?
Yeah, you could say that.
Well there's, they need to know a little bit about you.
So you said, you know, good morning, my name's Kath .
I'm a, the business repre , I'm, I represent th er, T N T super mail, I  er, am responsible for business development here 
you've recently received  er erm, a some information from our company, am I right?
Yes.
Yes.
Or I know you've recently received some information, that's good.
I can see that you are a hairdresser  now what question do you wanna ask?
Would you ever need 
How often do you have a use for a parcel carrier?
How often would you ever send, or something into your company, or have something sent out especially, by perhaps a customer request?
So you need to know how often, right?
Assume something goes.
I guarantee something'll go.
It might be once in 
Yeah.
bloody blue moon  and you may not be worth putting on your  and calling every six weeks Mandy, but, it might be worth asking it in a more open way.
Because Sod's law'll say if you ask it open, you'll find summat out you never assumed.
Mm.
Yo you know.
You never thought.
Well actually, yes we're the head office 
for a regional group here and as well as have a, er an actual service for hairdressing we also have a distribution  er control shop at the back.
And, we have our own delivery service  to our cu , to our own network.
Now what's the question you can ask this hairdresser that got his own bus , I know I'm using a, a an extreme 
Mm mm.
point, they've got their own delivery service.
What else would you like to ask?
Is there any place you can ever not go to?
What areas does it, do they tend to serve?
What happens if  give me an scenario, a cautionary tale like the insurance man does to his customers.
You sell  
God forbid 
God forbid?
God forbid that you should ever lose parcel  and Mrs  on Newcastle hasn't got a wig base any more
your reputation's going to be in tatters, isn't it?
What do you do in that situation?
What are you gonna do?
Do you know the one thing in that 
God forbid!
he said, and I wrote it down here, which I think is wonderful, probe th the past problems and future worries.
What would happen if
Yeah.
in the future?
What has happened, when
Mm.
is past.
Yeah?
That's a very good question.
That's how they do, sell insurance cos e everybody knows who they've use, had a mishap and not insured.
Because if you say, have you, what type of question's this?
Have you ever had any problems?
It's a closed one.
Na , no.
And what they gonna say?
No.
How difficult was it Mandy to think when Jenny was asking you about your holiday?
It was quite difficult.
Why?
Mm mm.
And you , you gave  mono , what's the word?
syllabic.
Syllabic.
Syllabic.
syllabic.
Can't get my teeth right.
Monos , one word answers didn't she?
Long words like.
What I'm saying is, is if customers 
feel like that and if you ask, if, they must say yes, no, because it, to engage, hang on th the phone rings, ring, ring, ring,ya , yes?
Yeah?
Erm, yes  right  er, yes .
You know, and they're in this sort of 
Mm.
mo , very 
Yeah.
fra ,ma frame of mind, you got to demand  and wait for the answer, even though it might take a minute for the  to say  erm, erm, oh we use erm, you know, we've got a, a, a local van that comes and se , like, you know .
What happens if   Well, oh sa , pwurgh, I don't know, I mean she has to wait  for a week .
You know?
You know.
Or we rush one over to her specially, make a special journey.
Right, now where d'ya, what do you wanna go, what question do you wanna ask her next?
Someone other than Justin now.
How do you achieve that?
How do you achieve that.
Good question.
What sort of question is that Bill, open or closed?
Open.
Open.
Wo!
That is open question.
How do you achieve that?
Now sometimes what salesmen do is suggest the answer, do you do this?
Do you do that?
Do you do that?
Do you do that?
Shut up!
Don't keep on.
How do you do that?
Quite difficult eh, er  well usually somebody goes in their car, you know.
She'll send her, or I'll le I'll let someone go, someone from the shop go.
Now what do you wanna ask?
You think of the problems.
Could this possibly leave you short handed?
No that's a closed question.
Closed.
. Right, a good question.
A very good question.
Could it leave you short handed?
Change it to an open question.
How do you manage when this person's out delivering  the goods?
Hang on Justin.
Same question Paul
Yeah.
but what it means is, what's the difference?
Well, you've gotta .
That's right.
Or, you shut up 
and I start talking, you'll find out more.
How do you manage?
Really?
God forbid!
How do you manage?
Touch wood.
Oh!
You don't say?
Honestly?
You've got that, you blow the problem up a bit.
Hang on in there now, you've found it!

And sh what's in those coloured bags there?

Buck.
Was she out today then?
She was out yesterday  about   oh sorry, he's querying the arrears, he said he wasn't there for what, two months?
Aha.
Which he wasn't,and true, he was living with me.
She wants to know where she's living    I said, oh I know where she's living  she's in  she's now got a property down in   I says and I, I be honest er  ooh she said to me, yeah sorry  oh who are you?
Are you his father?
I says no I'm his brother-in-law but I know all his details  and I said, he wasn't here!
And no matter how little re rebate he gets  it'll be a help to him, why should he pay for something he didn't get?
Alright?
Then I said, have you got him a house yet?
And she says it's strange, but there's no movement in the Conway Estate  there's usually a good turnover of people who're moving in and out.
Wait a minute  it's no good  there is no movement.
There usually is a, a, a, vacant houses  but at the minute it's at a standstill.
Right  so that means if there's nobody moving out, John can't move in?
He neither filling another form, I says well I'll fill it in tonight for him  he'll sign it  and if I post it tonight you'll probably get it tomorrow.
I won't be in the office she says until er  May the fifth  and nobody else will deal with it  so there you are.
This is what, April the what, the fifteenth, the sixteenth?
What is it?
About three weeks.
Yeah, well there you are.
Yesterday was the fourteenth, it is the fifteenth.
What?
What did he put down?
He didn't, he didn't fill it in.
Ah he says, what about talking money?
But he doesn't want to talk money  he's hoping to get that bitch to come back and live with him  and she doesn't like us!
Well you can't blame her.
Jean, we don't even have see them  you know what I mean?
He doesn't have to pass our door to get the bus stop, he doesn't have to pass our door to get to the schools
or the children.
He doesn't have to pass this way  to go to the shops.
It's 
It will be handy for me though.
I can't see her coming back really  I mean she might come back for 
Well Christ well what did you get yesterday  you found her clothes, her trousers and her knickers!
She must have been staying there at the weekend!
She might stay  for a a weekend or something, but I mean  erm 
Aye get her end away  he's, he's no scruples!
Here, put these clothes away.
He hasn't 
Did you phone Kate?
No, I haven't.
No, well phone her  see how she is.
Now if she says why we were not here  or say  say she tells you she called on Saturday and we were out  just say to her   Raymond was drinking stout!
Fuck her   I was drinking stout  on Saturday night  and normally don't do it  because  we've simply no money!on the vodka  and say it wasn't even enough to buy a carry out  but don't say it unless she says she was here!
Oh  can't see her coming for Saturday night.
No.
She was here on Friday night.
She mentioned the silver teapot to John.
I said to him we made her a cup of coffee out of a teapot that was bought   and she says she was talking about it.
I didn't want John thinking that  I said  he would get her one.
No,
There's toilet rolls in there .
In that top one?
Aha.
Can you not put them in the bottom of the cupboard and get rid of that bag?
Jean, that's what drawers are for!everything, look at that dir lo look at that now!
I can  take some down and put them in the cupboard.
Are you sure Jean there's not a box of soap in there?
Aha.
There  is.
What?
No it's not    the soap  in that box is lying down in the coal hole.
What?
The soap out of the box is lying in the coal hole, the empty box is in the bin.
Okay.
Hey listen  you see these er  the stuff you have in that cupboard there, the hot press.
Aha.
Now, you'll have to go through it  right?
There's no use in keeping things that you're not gonna use  okay?
Now you, if you get rid of a lot of, of a lot of the rubbish  right?
Do you realize  how quickly your clothes would dry in there  in the hot press?
All of them.
No serious, in summer, it's alright now  good wind blow  you can get the clothes dried  in a reasonable time  but in the winter  you can't
I know.
right?
They would even dry quicker than  if you put them over the clothes horse  cos that's what those slats are for.
There's no use keeping things you don't need Jean, and you don't know anybody that needs them!
John  never mind him!
If he gets a house he'll need curtains, putting his curtains up.
Ha for God's sake Jean if she's gonna move back with him  she'll not want your stuff!
That's why she won't move back in with him, cos she says there's too much stuff there reminds him  reminds her of her  his ma  or your ma.
I think she was glad to take it all mine.
at the time Jean.
I don't want to ge to get involved, but you just can't help  and I don't want any of this shit out!
Now  watch this

Take them to the park.
And we're gonna be, he's on the earlies next week, and the following week.
He's on the early next week.
That's what I mean.
But, George is off Monday and Tuesday but  so if you were getting them, sitting here and bringing them up on Thursday  John can come here and get his tea here and then take them home.
Aye, but I'll have to go down next week because they're off school.

And I'd say to John

them and then take them down.

I wonder, is he trying to get her back into the house and she doesn't wanna come back.
Well, that's alright.
She's just have to 
Is she, she's in the 
ask Graham, you see, if 
Yeah.
she doesn't wanna, she'll find 
But if she 
her way again.
Yes.
I understand that.
But if she's living with someone else  how does she explain her absence  the weekend she goes to John?
Unless she says she going to so to go over and spend a weekend now and again with her kids but er  that sounds right.
Aye, but
And he doesn't be there.
But, I, what I can't understand is, why all of a sudden does he want her back and see the children, well for over a year he kept her away?
Told the children lies.
Unless he doesn't know she living with someone.
You know that saying Jean?
No.
Oh what a tangled web we weave  when first we practice to deceive.
What's that?
This dog here's taking over this house!
I know.
John's dog's not too well.
No?
No.
What's wrong with him?
He's very listless.
I said to Kelly Ann today, maybe it's fucking, erm sorry, maybe he's dying.
Cor!
I shouldn't have said it.
Sure Brandy's fighting.
I was telling Stephen today the story of a  did I ever tell you?
No.
Did I ever tell you Raymond?
My first job driving a lifting in the Harrow Street?
No.
There was a Mr and Mrs , Stephen was   and there was a Mr and Mrs , the caretakers, and they lived in the third floor of a flat there.
And, the first day I started  right enough, they were awful kind, awful kind  they were English people, I think.
They were.
He had a bad arm.
But anyway, er    well I'd, God forgive me!
He's laughing, the boy!
Raymond's jumping about laughing!
I dunno, er yes, I was eating jam, bread and jam today.
And anyway, the first day  she gave me  right enough, she came round every morning  with my breakfast  and brought it into the lift for me.
But, the first day she gave me  bread with jam and butter on it.
Now, you know I can take jam or butter
But not butter and jam.
That's the most revolting taste!
And instead,instead of telling the woman  I  I pretended to eat it  couldn't finish it  I put it down the lift shaft.
See?
Oh Christ, no!
The next morning the same thing happened  and I still hadn't the courage to tell her.
Cos I was that grateful for her, you know, making it.
Ya.
Jesus Christ, Jean!
You wanna have seen the butter and the jam, and the smell of it!
I can smell it now!
Oh God!
But anyway  this went on for weeks and weeks, and I kept on it down the lift shaft.
Instead of taking it out to the back and throwing it in the bin.
Mm.
Or you could 
Right.
keep it in your pocket and take it home.
Never thi never thinking!
The lift shaft was about  three foot deep.
Sorry!
Th the the well of the lift, you know from the  er,ju , when you went to the bottom floor
Aye, at the bottom, right.
I would say there was a drop of about three feet, right?
Down.
So anyway, after fucking weeks and weeks and weeks  I had  come out to me one day, and Mr  came out and he said to me  he had a wee bucket and shovels and he says er  bring me down to the first floor  so I opened to let him out and he gets out and he says to me, now take her half way between the first and second floor and stop her.
And I says okay, but why ?
He says I'm gonna clean the lift shaft.
Oh!
Well Holy  Jesus !
Oh God!
Clean it?
He says, I clean it every now and again.
People throwing, you know, cigarette packets and all down it.
Oh my God!
So when I couldn't say a word, so he was able to open the lift door, you see, from outside.
Yeah.
The lift was immobilized.
Once the door was open it couldn't move, so I couldn't go down on it.
Well he jumps down into the fucking lift shaft and he slipped on i oh eh well you fucking bastard you!
You bastard!
Honest to God Jean!
He slipped on the jam and the bread  and the butter.
Must have been bloody moulded and everything.
Bloody moulded!
Jesus
Oh hell!
Christ!
Oh my God, Jean!
What did you say?
What could I say?
It came up on his elbows and all, and his trousers were covered and there's bloody jam, er this concoction!
Oh Jesus!
Jesus!
That's terrible, isn't it?
No, they were, they were awful kind.
I forget what I said to them but the they forgot, the next, I don't think I got a bit of grub ever, since then.
Do you blame them?
Not until he left.
But I  it was only butter and the jam today that er,thi this came into my head.
Oh my God!
That was nineteen fifty three.
This is nineteen ninety two.
And I, every now and again I'm embarrassed by it.
Every now and again I think about it  and I'm deeply embarrassed.
You should be.
After doing that to her cooking!
Jean.
When he slipped in that  muck  he could have cracked his head against the side of the lift shaft!
And I couldn't have been, I couldn't get out to help him  I was stuck between the first and second floor!
Well I took it up about six or seven feet, you know, from the ground floor.
Mm.
When I say the first floor, I'm talking about the ground floor and the first floor, you know?
Drink your coffee lovey.
.Well in that  today he says er  when I seen the syringe coming out I just, I'll not be in the room if he's getting injected.
I wouldn't have let him give it to me.
Remember the time I took to vertigo?
And the minute he walks through your bedroom door, I says no.
I don't want any injections.
I was in the toilet, giving him a shot,and  I come back in and he just stuck in the syringe, there was nothing you could do.
Did he take a sample of urine away?
No, he went out to the car and brought my cards, he said he'd got it in my notes.
Oh!
And what did he say?
He says his urine was alright and his was al 
Oh well, that's good.
alright.
But he said there's all 
Oh!
He won't take a breakfast in the mornings any more.
He goes straight to work.
And th , and then he said talking about putting weight on nearly.
What did he say?
He asked , erm has he put any weight on?
And I have said yes, because  there's a couple pairs of his trousers  has ripped because he has put weight on.
Right.
But he didn't say anything when I said he has put a bit of weight on.
Raymond.
Drink affects us all different.
There are no two people affected by drink  the same way.
I know.
Now we're all individuals when it comes to that.
Now, you could be one of the people  that drink harmed quicker  than maybe, say  or maybe I'm  ta injured quicker than you with drink.
I mean, there are people who can drink va vast quantities  never seems to affect them.
They're up like a lark the next morning.
Jesus!
Me, like I mean, that's got now, my age, I'm not fit for three days!
Well, for two days anyway.
But, it's possible  that, the same amount of drink, two people drink, taking the same amount of drink  one is affected more badly than the other, or worse than the other.
Yo it's possible you could be one of those.
So you wanna be careful, like.
There's no way, Raymond, you should be able to drink  two or three of those bottles o of that cider  in ne in the one night, it's not good for you!
Or vodka either!
Well you, you don't drink that amount, but you know what I mean.
Stop,.
Jean I'd love a vodka now!
I'd a love a vodka and coke!
I'd give al almost anything.
Would you now?
I would sell you!
You would sell me?
No, I wouldn't.
I'm only, you know I'm only joking.
There er, there is none in the house  
I know there's not, maybe that's why I've  Where did you get that lemonade up the stairs Raymond?
Mm?
It's finished.
The cider, it should be ottoman ?
Inside the ottoman.
Did you get a bottle?
I didn't think 
No.

No, no.
Raymond said to me the other day, I asked him was there any lemonade?
And he said yes.
He went up and got a bottle of Sasperella he said to me there was two bottles left.
So when the Sasperella was brought down, that was at the end of it.
And there was two bottles 
Yeah cos you had the rest of the orange ?
No I didn't!
I got no orange Jean!
I gave you a drop  about that much

No, the two pro , the thing that the two prongs sit in  is cracked  so naturally  say it had to go into a hole that size, right?

Anyway, right  the park was lovely this morning.
Was it nice?

Out of the roa out of the road Patch, move over .

cigarette  
I would say  it wouldn't matter what time you went up the park there'd be somebody there.
But it was lovely.
It's the best time of the day to go up when there's nobody .
I'd imagine there'd be people maybe  down and outs maybe tramps sleep in that park with newspaper round them or something.
There you are.
You should've heard the different birds.
Lovely.
But I c er I only see a blackbird, that's all, two blackbirds  three.
But I could hear the rest of them.

That dog had the microphone in his mouth.
God save us all.

To me she looks very thin even though what we're feeding her.
Well it may be that type of a dog Jean.
I mean look at, look at Brownie  and look at, and John's is a fully bred thorough or er  a pedigree labrador.
She's more fat than a  chip and he's feeding her tons of stuff.

He wasn't pushed?
Yeah, he lo , left 
of his own accord.
You're welcome.
I've heard you selling the guy that showed you these two manifestos  one by the Tories and one by the Labour  and the one that stuck in my mind  it's that the Labour Party will have a minimum wage  to comply with the rest of Europe.
Tories saying, if they have a minimum wage it will tear a lot of people out of work.
And cause unemployment.
What a bloody disgrace when you're in a democracy and they want  minimum 
Pathetic!
wage!
So you can employ someone for
Peanuts!
ten pounds!no law against    the swines!
God help them!
Shows you that  .
Oh this is disgusting!
Yes,.
mm.
Mm, mm mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Don't  do that!
That's when accidents happen Brian!
That's what   oh that's alright for you!
Hit my bloody shoe that will!
I like to know  about this polyunsaturated  thing?
What do you want to know about it?
Well this  Carrie was on today about it.
I didn't put spread on your bread cos you said you weren't  takers.

Are you sti , are you taking it?
Still have spread on your bed  bread?
No.
Well not  not if I have salad on it, anyway.
You didn't  
No, I didn't put any on.
It's only Brian's.
It's for me who put it on.
Do you see, do you see what was written on the olive oil bottle and it says it's got  polyunsaturates.
Cos I thought it pure, you know ?
It's supposed to be.
Natural.
Oh!
Natural!
They don't put animal fat in it, surely do they?
Mm.
They 
Ay

Some vegetable fat

Very bad for you!
And when

Brian had  his cholesterol test on er  little bit of paper they  give you  with all the information  it tells you  the only oils you should use are erm  olive oil and  saffro saffrall 
Saffron.
oil.
Mm.
What about rapeseed oil?
Isn't that very
No, didn't say that.
Mm.
Rapeseed that
Well they had a 
list of what to eat, and a list of  list of what not to eat.
And I'm eating all the stuff I shouldn't be eating!
Not tonight.
Josephine!
So I  I only saffra ,saffrall oil now  or olive oil.
Mhm.
I didn't realise that 
What about sunflower oil?
No  not sunflower oil.
No good?
It's better than er  animal fat.
All the vegetable fats are better than the animal 
Mm.
fat.
Yes, of course!
Be, I mean 
Oh well we shouldn't have any rust.
No.
You think you're doing the right thing by eating  olive oil  pure oils but
Another twenty years, there'll be another turnabout 
Ah yeah!
won't there ?
Saying, you should be eating butter!
Should be 
Well it said 
drinking  whole milk!
it said in the paper this week  that  erm  broccoli  is the finest  vegetable you can eat.
The finest green you can eat.
Mm.
And it helps  stave off cancer, didn't it?
Well it helps fight 
It did kind of like  whatever!
it helps fight  the cancer cells it 
Mm.
said.
Where fats  encourage it.
Er greens.
But it specifically said
Broccoli.
Broccoli.
But  when tha , when the doctor was on in the morning, the doctor said it's the same as the carotene in carrot 
Yeah, and not actually 
I was just going to say they said carrots 
not actually  
a while ago didn't they?
Was the
Said it's the 
Not  
same  it's the same sort of thing.
And really the doctors have known that for years because  a lot of cancer patients they put on  er 
Diets.
vegetable  diets.
They can't have chocolate  they can have this erm  what's it called?
Not cova , is it coba or something?
This natural chocolate.
They can't have cakes  they can't have anything  that's got fats in it.
Oh!
One minute they say you can't eat , and then they say that you can eat it!
Yeah!
I think you've gotta try and strike a balance haven't you?
You'll get paranoid if you
Well  I think we all are to a certain extent!
It's not knowing isn't it?
Everything in moderation 
is my answer .
It's just some people that eat everything they live till they're ruddy  seventy or it's  makes you wonder!
Yeah, but I suppose they have to go by  the general rule
Oh yes!
but I mean, you'll always find exceptions won't you?
I'll go along with that.
Well I'm not gonna last too much longer!
Much longer!
If I eat another thing that's bad for me!
You don't Brian!
You
No, I do , I eat, I eat plenty of fruit  and  occasionally I'll have  a bag of chips.
Very, very occasionally!
We have  we have erm  fresh vegetables every day.
Mm.
And black pudding!
You're pretty active though aren't you?
No.
No.
You're not very active?

I'm up  up and down stairs 
you're still fit.
I will up  I will up your insurance!
Yeah.
Get the policy

And stress!
Mm.
Stress is probably  a greater factor than has been allowed for up to now.
Yes , but don't  women   
You won't actually get 
give a lot of stress to men?
Pressure!
I'm, I'm just asking the question!
Brian's not here enough to take any sp pressure from me!
I mean, they probably don't!
He's not here long enough!
He works one and half shifts, or two double shifts  .
You stick with me!
Well, better than being !
That'll keep you in black pudding for a while, Brian!
Carol's friends  he doesn't though!
He doesn't get paid overtime.
It's erm  these friends of ours, Judith and Peter, they've retired.
They 
Early retirement.

Or have they 
No they've got a hotel.

Hotel, yeah.
I thought you were gonna say the children are having it.
No, they sold it and er
So what, what are they gonna do?
Nothing.
They've got enough money not to   
Worry.
Mind you, they've worked hard for
Mm.
quite a few years, haven't they, to build that place up?
Sold herself to death that girl won't she?
Quite possible !

Round the clock wasn't it?
It was  no holidays  for a 
But they 
few years.
they sold it  for quite a bit of money  and
Well when he was thinking of selling it before he was talking about three hundred thousand.
Yeah.

Oh yeah, the guy that  he hasn't reduced it at all!
He hasn't?
Oh well he's asked them  what he was asking for it then?
Mm.
This guy wanted it.
Did it take him very long to sell it?
A chap saw it in  November, no!
Sorry, September  and really they weren't  bothered about selling at that time  although they always said if the right offer comes along
Mm.

It was November wasn't it?

Anyway, just after Christmas this guy says er  I still want  the hotel  so Peter said well you better put something down, you ge , better get something  so he  he went and put fifty thousand  as a deposit on it  and  then said  his legal  advisers would be in touch  and they had a month went by and they never heard anything, so Peter rang up, he was telling me the other day, er, he rang up  yeah, go, he doesn't want it you know?

With a site.
How long ago was that?
Two years ago.
Mm.
Well about that.
And the they  they keep saying to us, why don't you use it.
You see in the  lakes  mm, I mean you pay much more though 
Oh yeah, you pay for the site.

Yeah.
This is the thing.
Cos it is a nice site 
Mm.
Got everything piped on there  so 
Mm.
Is it  erm  are there are any residents there?
Is it a residential?
No, it's only a te , well I mean you can only stay on it for ten months a year.
Ah yes!
A year  so er  from the first of March  to the first of October  you can use the  but  after
You can go up for the day.
Oh yes, but you can't
Not continuously occupy it.
But you're not
No.
sleeping 
Mm.
there.
And they like the  erm  the water, excuse me!they like the water drained out  the site, you know, they like it sort of all the water switched off on, on each van
Oh yeah!
through the winter
Mm.
so there's no  there not gonna be any 
Freeze up.
any problems at all 
Mm.
they can drain the whole system on the site so
I mean you 
can go up there if you were going to stay and make a cup of tea and a  sandwich or something.
So you're taking your water with you.
Well you'd have to take a car er
Kettle of water.
water.
So is there somebody on the site all the time 
Oh yeah 
then?
there's a resident
Mm.
erm  site manager there.
I think he opens the  no, he can't do it on the site cos it's in er  what is it?
National Trust.
National Trust  land so  
Well where they are you can only see a , one other van can't you?
Yet there's loads there, it's just the way the  .
Oh it's on an elevated spot is it or the 
Well sort, there sort of like little coves aren't they and  they're  you can only just see one van from where they are.
Oh that's nice because it's 
Mm.
private .
Oh yeah!
I mean we had er
It's like being in the woods isn't it?
marvellous time didn't we?
Mm.
It was so quiet!
Erm, until it rained  and when it rains 
And then it drums on the roof then!
Ahhh
Mm.
Bloody hell, I mean you
Especially in the night!
It's all it's all trees.
But the they're fine in the summer.
But they're hellish  cold in the winter!
Mm.
Yes  yeah.
Erm  but they are colder than a caravan!
Well , I mean they're only thin walls aren't 
Mm.
they?
But cos 
Ooh aye 
they're so long  erm  they always seem colder  than a caravan  although it didn't 
We've never been in the winter  that was whe I wouldn't know!
No, I mean when we went up it was  it wasn't  erm  winter time  it was  late summer wasn't it, when we went up?
It wasn't so warm.
I love 
Mm.
a bit of cold!
And  i it felt damp.
Mm.
And if you wake up in the morning  and all the condensation 
It didn't!
Oh the windows were, but it never felt damp!
It did to me the first time we stayed.
Just weren't used to it you see.
Well there wouldn't 
Oh yeah.
be any heating in the bedrooms, I don't suppose, would there be?
Just a
No, it didn't have a radiator in the bedroom .
The heaters are erm, in the kitchen or the lounge area I suppose.
Well it's   
Nice to spend time in the  in the warm weather though.
Mm.
I think I would have  bought something a bit more substantial at it, I mean, if you've that amount of money, they must have a fair amount of money
No, they didn't, though, no.
The money was tied up.
Well er, I know what you mean 
It was all tied up.
and  I understand that because I, I'd  probably feel like that, I'd sooner invest in bricks and mortar even if were only a little end-terrace house 
Yep!
Yep.
than a caravan  or a mobile home on a site.
You see they, they've only got so long on this site with that van
Mm.
and then they've either got to replace the van
Mm.
Pardon me !
But erm, on that  site, he's pretty good the manager there.
They've only got six years.
No!
Tha , as long as you  keep it 
Oh yes!
maintained 
Mhm.
Mm.
they'll let you  leave it on longer.
But 
They 
otherwise is it normally just a six year
Well I thought it 
Normally.
was ten?
No, no!
It's normally six years  then you replace your vans on the sites.
That's the way 
Oh it's not six years!
You'd tell us anything 
It doesn't seem very long does it?
For six 
Peter told us it was six
You couldn't spend sixteen thousand and leave it there for six years!
Course you can!
And wha you'd have to re 
It was longer than six, six years!
It wasn't  
I think it was ten years!
Take no 
Ah.
notice of him!
It was six years Peter mentioned!
You're not a reliable source 
No he didn't!
of information Brian sorry!
Get your facts 
He mentioned six years to me!
Rubbish!
He mentioned six years!
Rubbish!
He mentioned six years to me!
Rubbish!
I'll tell you!
I'll mention six years to you!
You won't live another six years to find out!
Oh oh oh God !
Kept up with the insurance policy!
Ahhh !
Cooking down to you boy!
Might I go to the toilet mam
No!
No, no!
Take that microphone with you so we can hear what your doing!
Will you stop it?
You haven't still got it on have you?
No!
Hopeless  with that on because  of course, he's been  wearing a pullover all the time and  initially he had it clipped on the right hand side of his belts  and of course , with that switch  where is it?
The red switch  there  being  right on the end  when you depress that the play switch goes down as well.
But with him having on this side, because he's so blooming awkward  he's been pressing the play switch  and of course, so the tapes been turning round, haven't bothered to che , so  you know, he was sort of saying well  well play that tape and I'll  write their names down of the people as they speak, just the first names, you know  so there's loads of
loads of blank spaces on these tapes !
You're best just putting it on a table Margaret.
And the rest of the time  he's had this, sort of on, on the pullover here and of course it's so sensitive that it  it picks up every  rustle!
I mean  he was talking to Norman  over the fence the other day and it sounds like gunfire
In  in the microphone you know !
Every now and again the  voice comes in.
I mean, it was a windy day as well and I don't think that helped because the wind was sort of blowing into the mike  but er  and when he took it to college there was this noise all the time, he must have had it clipped under here somewhere!
I said, well you know it's gotta be 
I'll put the kettle on for you Brian.
it's gotta be  outside  the clothing !
But erm
Well it's, it's alright, I mean
Well  er, I think probably, I mean i so , this lady came on Friday and she's coming on Friday of this week to collect it  or collect the tapes
Mm.
and she said  you know, use as many as you can which  which we have done   and a lot of blank spaces on them !
You haven't got  er 
Er 
Top of the Pops on one of these?
Mm mm, no no, no.
No?
Or Radio Two,tried but er  but erm  he's got sort of better.
I mean, today we've been to  well we went into Henry and Norman's and they were  having a chat  and it's better if you're just sitting down like this with a mike just  you know 
Oh yeah!
not attached really because it is very sensitive 
Ooh ooh yes!
and I mean, unless yo , and they said don't clip it near your throat because  it would   I felt like clipping it round his throat !
It er  it would interfere with the erm 
Are you taping about that ?
with the reproduction so
You've gotta go you have!
You're coming very close Brian!
She's trying to get rid of me, I'm sure she is!
You're not are you chuck
She doesn't mean it really!
No, course she doesn't mind!
Anyway, how about a car boot sale on

That's right.
I still got a free one.
Isn't there a mail box here in the college?
I don't think so.
It's on the way 
Oh!
Should be one!
Would of thought
Well, are those your chairs?
Yes, ah, these
Are they?
Ten minutes to go.
It's too high get it back on the chair!
It'll be too high.
Yes.
Oh I see, yes yes yes.
Well it's so many things!
It's higher than the one I  had because erm  the base is  obviously I just had the  springs going across didn't I?
Yeah I, I sa I've erm  cos I'm gonna  reduce the 
Mm.
base, you know the  spring unit what you were talking about.
That's right.
If you can get them up 
Yeah that was
high,
Yeah.
So I can   
So you done it with springs, that's right 
Yes 
yeah.
just  you know
Is it just cos it's  you're a lady anyhow, I mean she co 
I mean a 
probably not big enough for a man.
I wouldn't say  I wouldn't say anything Gwyneth, to me i , I'd be quite happy!
But then  Joan is speaking on  how it should look.
What she said was  the head was
Oh I see, too high?
Yes.
Well it wouldn't be for you would it?
Well not really.
It depends on  doesn't it?
Those Ercoles that we got, those  wing  they're too  they're too low for me.
I think they are  
Surprising, yeah.
inches.
No, they're not made for a tall man er, you know my 
No.
wife's quite 
and your 
happy but  my head's like this and I I  bit disappointed really 
Well that's the trouble!
I thought that they were  the wings were gonna come up  you know, the, the old type that kept the draught off.
Which 
You wouldn't have draughts, you have double glazing!
Well that's the thing you see but er 
If you have double glazing.
Oh dear!
Now I've  
No, but erm 
Well I 
That's what I anticipated, but that, yes that's lovely !
Be quite happy 
She said 
with that.
she said we didn't  but she's on her own.
I'm not  
Yeah.
but she's nice isn't she?
She'll be al , yes, that's right, yeah, yeah.
You see these are one size anyhow, cos
The wings, are they?
When it comes in it's hand made which
Yes, I see 
and he made it, you see  I mean i it cost over  twenty years ago told me  I think those were too small.
Small, yes, they should of been a bit 
Well, I mean she knows that 
deeper really, so that the 
knows that well I'm not   I mean, why should I?
It's different.
Nice!
Yeah.
Not only that erm  I mean you could
I think she'll be very happy.
Yeah, I think so.
Yes.
I think, you know in 
certain cases you've gotta say to Joe, well you mean that's what the lady wants now  you know those Ercoles I did?
Well she convinced me to start off  with foam, you know  webbing on the foam and I said well 
Yes.
she said it's a lot cheaper  and easier, so I hadn't got the springs at that time
No.
You re , you really
but then er  somebody said  don't do that  you've gotta think what the value
That's right.
of how it's 
Definitely!
supposed to me.
See, I did it 
So 
once
in the end I persevered 
when I first came  when I first came, that was the one thing that I was  like  that  was the fact that  that I might be pushed  that way  whereas  I only 
Mm.
really nice  he's thinking that  I mean that, he couldn't never lift the seat up.
Oh it's gorgeous!
That's why I love the  sprung hair and the horse hair ideally, you know I love it!
I mean, do you know
Now that'd be better for me 
better for you
but then I  as I say, you don't cater for every height on the 
Whe 
chair do you?
When I went to Noreen's  if I make that to be used with a cushion or without
Mm.
she can always put the cushion over the 
Yes.
and then take it off the chair .
Well it , ah well, of course the other thing you'd have to do to do that is put a top
Oh I'll do that in there.
Oh that's what you're doing is it?
I've got enough material.
Oh well!
I've got enough material.
So you're gonna give this a top stuffing?
Yes.
No, I'm gonna give that a top cover for this .
Yeah.
That's what I want.
I see, just one, I see yeah.
That's right.
So all you want is a bit of erm
on the side  you know, piece of wadding
Wadding.
I've got the both types.
Well that's great!
I've got the narrow  and I've got the thick.
That's great!
So she can please herself can't 
Mm.
she?
And you can make 
I think the 
that  loose.
Yeah, and then 
Good!
she, if she wants a cushion she can put it on, and 
You're happy!
Joan's happy!
That's right.
Everyone's .
That's a good idea that!
That's, that's got one.
You've got in effect, a dual purpose
Mm.
chair  haven't you?
I if I set it up there
It's too low is it, for you?
Well
I see yes.
The height from there
Oh yes, I see, yeah.
isn't it?
Mm, yes.
It's that comfortable it's actually going off to sleep here!
You'd better get some work done you know .
I had to get her out of bed this morning!

And that  
The golden rule is if you're reversing you must look behind you!
Yeah, but she said she did  and he wasn't there.

I think the 
you when you learnt to drive  when you came to reversing you're told you must look
Yeah.
out of that rear window all the time  not using your rear view mirrors  look once as well.
That's what a lot of people do,the , they look once and then turn forward and bang!
It's fatal!
Cos anyone can whizz in behind you!
And she's got no chance if she told the truth!
Of course, the other thing, if she says oh well I er  didn't know this feller was moving and er
Yeah  they're never going

but er  it's just the same, the  they 
Yes.
go to a nursery  and pay six or seven times as much  and
They want it for nothing or or 
next to nothing!
Yeah, I know.
They don't want it half price 
They don't realise!
they want it for a
You still got the 
fifth!
same  overheads
Heating.
heating costs and
, yes.
compost and  all of that.
And the work is  tremendous 
Yeah.
doing that sort of thing, I'd, something I would never take but there you are that's people for you!
What?
Like this game to some extent isn't it?
The furniture they want it  somebody'll want it done for no 
I've broken many the dowel or tenon or something like that!
Oh!
In just 
Erm

Well, I mean, say it's like that where you just  polishing with a cloth or something

Ya.
Say that was a tenon there  the underneath part of the chair you're not gonna  see  drills a hole in there
Mm.
and then jegs  and after a few  five minutes
Yeah.
doesn't get  you know, it breaks down the glue inside.
and that hasn't broke.
No, no, you've been lucky there but
Yeah.
it's a good tip that you know, isn't it?
I've never heard of it before.

Michael  the erm  the up , the furniture restorer that's erm  he's coming here.
He's not here.

Michael .
.
He's written a book.
We've all got the book.
Oh yes!

And and yo 
I

Well he he sort of came and asked us, you know  do you mind 
Yeah.

I see!
to get this
Teaching?
other exam.
Yeah.
As I say, they  he qualifies you see.
Yeah.
Er  so it's mainly erm  what I've just been telling you about  cleaning  all 
Mm.
screws, how to identify furniture and  mainly ol and his methods are totally different to  what we've learnt 
here, especially with polishing 
Mm, mm 
and that.
Mm.
Uses hardly any polish  it's nearly all waxing though.
Is it?
Oh!
Stripping and everything's a different technique.
Oh very good!
But he 
And that's part of your three days is it?
You do three don't you?
Yeah, ah that's right, yeah.
Well er, the Tuesday is supposed to be  furniture restoration, that's what it's been
And yo , that's  
but then he started doi you know, a few weeks ago it wa , well it'll be the fourth week I should think!
Mm.
And 
Fourth.
who do you do the er   for?
Furniture restoration.
Well that's the  the three day, you know, George i he's  
George, Bill and
No, Bill doesn't go in!
No,
He doesn't ?
This is just  woodwork.
Oh I see.
Ah well we do a bit of copying.
Now that's, is is that in this class here?
In this room?
The first years come in here  for upholstery.
Mm.
We go in there to the  woodwork
And that's on Tuesday mornings?
Tuesdays.
Yeah, yeah 
Oh I see!
It's a fiver each that is.
Some 
I wouldn't mind doing that.
Well, I I liked it, you know it's  it's so interesting and er  he is very good!
Trouble is, some of them have made the mistake I think, of saying well  it's not good for us because we don't do really old furniture you know.
Nobody's gonna come to us for the lease of erm  William the fourth or anything like this!
No.
Or William and Mary and say er  can you do, they're gonna go to an expert like him.
But then  if they got tips
You never know, you might have to do a  top of an 
Yeah.
old, really old 
Yeah.
table.
And not just go on and strip the  
Yeah.
which
Yeah.
he's still really  tha that's a 
Yeah, you ca 
of him that is.
No.
Don't, never use that stuff!
Makes his own wax!
Does he?
Showing us how to 
Yeah.
we're gonna do some  between us.
So if he's got to  he's ga got to re re-buy something then he just clips it down with sandpaper does he?
Oh no!
No, just  cli , and yesterday he'd got this marvellous cleaner he uses.
Just wipes it.
It just cleans.
Cleaner  and then er  wire wool at  at the last 
Mm.
resort
Mm.
but  oh he he, he does do stripping obviously but the 
Yeah.
the stuff he uses is ve isn't as  caustic as the stuff we 
No.
use.
No.
It just takes the surface off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then th , the object in the, is to build up a pattern 
Yeah.
there you see, so it still looks old.
And he 
Yeah.
does a lot of patching, somebody's got a  cigarette hole you, you've gotta match that up.
Yeah.
Very interesting!
Yeah.
But it would 
pricey If I wanted to come you see, I'd have to pay again!
Oh well , yes, yeah, oh well I wouldn't be coming.
I'd have , I'd have to pay for it.
I have to 
That's right.
pay for everything I do, you know.
It's part of my second year, so  yeah I know.
Yeah.
So I'll be in the same boat as you next year.
Will you?
Well yeah, I've had a  come for one day, pay for a day and hope I can  sneak in on the two day.
That's what 
Ya.
you can do.
Mm.
Yeah well we could
I mean, Joan said well ma , you know make the numbers up, once you're here  come in on the second.
Well we can still be away for about four lessons at four thirty so er
Well that makes up
and he'd been away for three months so that you know I mean  
Well you see Eric was offered two months.
Little Eric, the one that's always 
Yeah.
in there.
So the  let him come in the day, two days  he was off two months, Christmas time,
How is he?
with his bad back.
Tha , well he went to Spain for a month to sort of recuperate.
Yes.
And  and come in on the, he came on the Tuesday and he's been three days a couple of weeks so   
Eric will be pleased at that.
Between friends I think  
I haven't got a bad back, she had me
Wings on  you would wouldn't you?
Ooh yes!
Yes.
The wings go on last don't 
Last 
they?
yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Ray, can I ask you ?
Sorry Pat, what?
Have you got glue from the
No.
Yes.
Kept this space 
There?
specially for you Pat.
Oh that's very sweet!
With you in mind.
Well erm  Mary's 
here  so she can budge up a bit.
Yes.
A gem you are!
There's usually another guy here today so he hasn't showed up, so there you are so  we got bags of room.
From what I've heard she'd got no chance that lady!
Well yes.
As long as you're alright.
Bit shocked really I suppose.
Yes, well it is!
Yo you sort of er  if you ran into someone you know, you do something silly it's it's it's  it's automatic to say oh I'm sorry  we will  you know how much
Yeah.
?
Yeah.
But today, especially these youngsters the attitude is I'm 
Yeah.
not saying anything!
Course it is, you say anything 
Now it's sticking out a mile, but the time home that make up another ruddy story to give 
Yeah.
to their insurance I mean 
Oh yeah.
it's awful.
But 
Oh she blamed me, she said I was coming round the corner  at high speed!
And I, we weren't anywhere near the corner!
We were this end  sorry, we were this end, you know  .
Yo you were stationery were you?
I was stationery.
She got no chance!
You ran into a , I mean  if she's reversing
She reversed  
She's not looking, she couldn't of been looking!
She's she's looked then she's taken her eyes off the back.
Yeah.
Must of!
Well, she probably didn't look at all!
Could be.
I mean I I
I said, I hooted her as well.
Mm.
And er
That's fatal!
But I I was always taught, probably like yourself that you must look through that, turn round and look through that rear
Yes.
mirror.
Cos if you take your eye off for a second, bang somebody's there!
Oh yes.
So I don't think she's got much hope now you know.
Have you got 
witnesses anyway?
Yeah .
Oh!
I hope sa er  , see of course it's all question of getting it sorted out as quickly as you can.
There's the insurances and the tale that she tells them but tha , I think they'll have that weighed up you know.
Ha!
Well I hope so.
Cos I had an awful experience about  ooh, four years ago, I had this old Moggy Morris Minor  coming along very slowly  north of Hull it was  and this chap and his  about finished work you know, so I  going past this  cri , there's a cricket match going on  and he was looking like, I could see  and his girlfriend!
And the car just went like this  into the middle of the road slowly  towards me  I swerved  onto the  grass 
Yeah.
verge  and he caught my back bumper an an ripped it off you see!
Got out the car, said good God lad what were you doing?
And he never said anything and he said  something like, I'm not saying anything.
I said  you ran into me, look at the position of the cars!
Ooh no, he said we'll swop insurances that's all he'd say!
It was his dad's car.
Yeah.
His dad was on holiday.
Anyway, I, I should of got the police there and then and had 
Yeah.
him breathalysed although it wasn't 
Yeah.
drink or anything but 
Yeah.
police said to me afterwards you should of  we can't fight your claim  you 
Yeah.
should of had him there and then and measured up the road a bit 
Yeah.
we could see how
Yeah.
you're too late  to have ended up knock for knock.
It's as though 
Yeah.
it were partially my blame you know.
They paid half  of erm 
Yeah.
totally his fault you know!
But these youngsters today they could kill 
Yeah.
someone they wouldn't er
Yep.
they wouldn't be compassionate about it you know.
Well I proved I was stationery this morning there's no way she's right.
Oh no, I think you got a pretty good case there.
It's nasty though isn't it?
It leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.
Where are you, North Wales, Chester?
Yeah.
I thought, ooh   by that 
Yeah.
you know.
Anyway, one lady  came  came to the house whilst I was here  and she said oh  it's not quite what I want.
last week  getting married.
Just a .
Put a deposit down will you, oh can't 
Yeah.
pick it up till the weekend.
Yeah.
But I'd come down to er, one two five you see in the local paper.
Oh!
So  anyway, it's gone.
As I say, it didn't cost 
Yeah.
me much.
Didn't cost me 
No.
anything to  to buy that one 
Oh well.
so er  but it's stuck there for er weeks on end, you know 
we've been finished it
Yeah.
bit of a .
And the ?
Oh yeah,tha , that was Lorraine  you know Lorraine that was here.
Yeah, but then  I suppose
But then she's  you know, otherwise hers .
Where does sh where's her shop?
in Wallasey 
Oh, in Wallasey again?
Ah.
I see, yeah.
Oh well I could go there and have a look, anyway one day

because  is she the only one there is she or 
She might be interested I don't 
Yeah.
I don't know whether the other girls go round with her but erm  what's the other girls name  that was here?
Wah I didn't know that very well.
I knew
Oh!
Lorraine because I, you know
She ru she, she does her own work she starts being  
Oh yes, there was another girl, yeah.
Yes.
A friend of my daughter's went in the other week and bought a little erm  table off her  erm  and, you know, it's quite , I mean it's all, that's it.
Wanted some new furniture.
Trouble is she only wants to buy it off you cheaply you see, for
If you can, it's how she does it, she might erm
Sometimes they sell things for you don't they?
And charge you  for it.
That's what I was gonna say, I she liked that new erm   in there.
I know 
Yeah.
she did do that, what they get for it   erm
Usually they're pushed for space as well, you see, that could 
Yeah.
be  the other thing, you know.
It's been there  er, for sale for a few months and sold it by February at a 
That's right.
loss.
To save on .
She had the Monday market didn't she?like all  things, you know, though people do tend to go in and look and then say ooh yes, very nice!
Yeah.
We'll think about it and say ooh oh  you have this don't you?
Especially at lunch with the  they come up and spend 
Ooh yes.
little bit on , they're still buying.
Ooh yes!
Because they're going  they go by the band road  down south.
And sell it much dearer there obviously so er  you know
They, they still buy it    no, okay I can charge  where in this economic situation and we think .
Oh no, no!
No I  no, there is erm 
We bought , we bought stuff ourselves you know, to people and we've spent on it, so
Yeah.
It's my last weekend  but it was such a scramble!
I was, wanting to get home  I, I couldn't 
Mm.
be bothered but erm
Yeah.
Well you know the erm  Handbridge ?
Yes.
Yes 
Well you 
Yes.
but I think there's only one  shop there, The Pearl Antiques  just over the bridge on the right hand side
Over the bri , oh I know yes!
A 
anyway 
that they call Vineholts Vineholts is a cake shop right opposite there.
Oh yes , that's right yes.
Well I hadn't been there for ages!
Have you got a a row of shops on your left  by the pub
Yes, and then on the right 
then er er a park on your right and 
right.
then a couple of the shops, and she's about on the corner this
Oh, well I haven't been that way yet.
Just a couple of ladies erm  well it's one lady, I think er  the lady just helps her.
We've been in a couple of times and I said that I wanted a chaise you see  ooh I got this  erm  one for   Victorian one  it's very nice, and lovely warm  you know, the legs  anyway it was one  one thousand three hundred you see, so I thought, oh  I said well  I didn't wanna 
I beg your pardon?
Well that's what you can spend now for a good one.
But this is ready to take home  but  I said oh, can I have it out?
She said, yes.
That's finished is it then?
Oh yes, yes!
Had to be.
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Only one seat then?
Oh yes yeah.
I said to her have you got one that's in bits?
But er  for three hundred, you know   er  but  er er
But
the back was loose!
And I said, and she said oh well  she said you know well it's  that's how you've gotta take it stripped, for me to take that to get that  done up by a restorer  you'd have to take all the upholstery off, or quite a bit off
Well I was gonna say
and then if it'd go up to about one seven she said, and I couldn't sell it here she said, I'm not Chester prices  I'm just that bit cheaper.
Which, a lovely lady!
But 
But 
I thought, I was surprised to see it was loose, you know.
Well that's it, I mean the joints 
You've gotta take it home like that.
the joints have got to be done haven't they?
The joints have gone and this wanted doing but  it would of been extortionate she said, you know, to get it done
Yeah.
and then try and sell it  you know, take 
Well that's alright.
all that into account.
I think it's terrible really!
That's bad!
And I've seen chairs like that, I've seen  I don't know whether it's there but  a couple of places, bedroom chairs, gorgeous things, you know!
And   the backs!
You know, you can do this with the back!
I mean, you don't like saying to the people 
No.
you know, because 
No.
their faces drop when  you
They do.
you're not supposed to say  
You'll be marked man when you get in there.
You're supposed be glad that it's old and   don't sit in there, you know th but er  it's bad, but though isn't it?
It is.
Well you know, you turn things out here and you go in  you might see that little  
Yeah, put it in  
and magnified in your mind aren't they?
That's right, like my  my .

Hey one thing I was  gonna query you on Mike  the erm  sanding sealer you know  you say you must leave that for at least a week?
Well, you can bi what I tend to is  is get a coat on  er, first thing in the morning, another coat in the afternoon and then leave it for a week.
Cos it really does, it still goes on settling into the 
Oh yeah!
grain , have you got it here?
I don't know, I, I, I took it home 
with me.
No, I took it home, I I was sort of leaving that to you you know, as you say, as you've just mentioned now  that, but no, I thought when you first  of you said haven't got the time to put these all the layers of  on, you know and
That's why!
and you  you gotta wa 
Yo 
Yes, I suppose 
You should come in the breaks.
I was purely killing myself!
Initially you you're doing that then saying right, forget that one, get on with something else and that's there for a week or whatever till that  thoroughly hardens and then .
, look at that  and then and then you can  straight onto it.
Right, I'll leave that till Tuesday.
So if I bring it again on Tuesday
Yeah.
in the state that I've  you know
Have you put one coat on  already?

Good old
And started off by the sea  but that wasn't a good idea really was it?

So we just stayed anywhere  and if you hadn't got anywhere to go
That's right.

Used to say 
I've always
do you want a cup of tea that's been stewing for three days?
Just go and get it when you are  when you want more of this.
Ah, but it's goes too

I'll just move some
Alright, my old son God bless!
That'll do me now.
In er, in that sense I agree 
I I
that waxing's taken half an hour!
Yeah, it's just this waiting for this sanding sealer you see to  dry.
But then you're not spending hours
No.
putting  you know the  button on the while you are here.
If you do it the way Bill says.
Everybody 
Will you be wanting it?

for so long, I mean I can't  
I mean yo , you don't get waxing off Bill do you?
No.
Yeah we, he showed me.
Was it two times   that's what I do  and then  and then  let it harden off  and then 
Mm.
put the wax on.
That's why .
I think the  some of the we've  turned out isn't so important is it?
Oh no.
You know, you get something that's only twenty five years old
it's not so important to get it perfect.
I say, it's like a 
You know, as the stuff he's  doing because 
Oh yeah!
That's right.
And he's very good!
Very good top quality you see so  he's gotta have it right.
That stuff.
It's handy to know the right way to do it innit?
Yes, I suppose it is.
And I mean the way he did that table
I suppose cos he   
It's nice that table anyway!
That old one's gone, you know.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with that.
It's a nice approach I think.
Mm.
And he makes it interesting.
Mm.
Whereas  Bill 
Bill 
tends to be a bit I don't know  se dictorial 
doesn't he?
This is how it's done  get on with it I'm going now!
You know, and then if you ask him again he says, I've told you once!
But he does get funny!

And it's right opposite  or near the  well, not opposite the Billets it was the auction rooms before 
Yes.

Yes.
But they had one in the corner you see and I could see the back leg was gone  said to Margaret an said I might as well do something of that, you know, to do up  it's the only one  that they had there that wanted  really wanted repairing, so the feller said ooh  I don't know he said  hang on, I'll look in the book.
Very, very lucky!
Victorian  walnut.
A hundred and forty.
The state it was in !
Oh that's crazy!
I said oh, I said, I'm very sorry but  I don't kno , don't know what you'd have to charge to justify that  you know, to buy it and then do it up, I don't know!
Yeah.
You'd have to get two hundred and fifty at least, wouldn't you?
So I thought that was a bit greedy so, that's not bad at all that!
That would go for a lot more in Mold 
Would it?
Oh yes!
Oh yeah!
Definitely!
Which one do you get it from?
I got this  in
Tell me.

Philips  in Chester.
Oh that's the one you're  oh!
But what it wanted to

The  go 
Mm.

But it is a, it wasn't a, it wasn't in  ordinary auction  what is was, somebody had died in Nantwich and they were doing  selling the contents the of her house
Oh I see, clearing.
and  it  it was on a, on another  day, I can't remember what day it was, but there wa

Ah!

Ooh I'll have make a not of that!
I saw erm  we saw a campaign chair  near Mold week before last  it was  I asked the guy how much  put down on it, you know, he said thirty pounds so I sa , I said I saw it for forty.
Didn't stay!
When you can get choice of them, if they're going for forty over a piece!
Mm.
Forty five, fifty, something like that.
And all it was, was a tiny thing, like a ruddy camp stool!
And the leg  so he said, well  half a leg was missing.
So I thought well I'm in with a chance, you know, one's  wanted a  and this leg repairing  so  compare it with that  no 
No 
comparison really!
Very, very reasonable!
Mm.
You got a chair that's worth  another couple of hundred there so  well, not yet.
Get this bit right on the back!
Oh!
God!
Ah!
Don't you get   critical when you've been here a bit?
John, I've got to  get the car on the ramps.
Feel my back breaking!
Is there any way to  stop those ramps
Yes.
shooting away.
That's why,.
I used to get two  four by fours from the wall in the house.
Well I mean, that's an idea  
No I can't do it  I haven't got these  !
And  but they seem to shoot away though.
Bit of carpet.
Carpet on  on what?
On that.
On the ramps?
Well on, no  o on the floor.
No, you know the actual ramp itself
Yes.
It's in, it's in rungs is it, yes?
Yes.
The bottom rung  bit of carpet round that line  and wrap round the bottom rung.
So, but if a tyre runs on that  you won't end up 
Oh I see!
The car .
It won't fall back.
It's like double.
Yeah.
Hey!
Of course, that's right it's cos it's got it on the .
Yeah, so you're alright dad, just go on.
Ah, you don't 
You could  you could  make loads  I can make loads of them!
Yeah, but  the good thing, you know
It's a good ramp innit, you see?
Yeah.
But I, you know, I told you the front brakes they er  snapped the middle and all this.

Cylinders all round, haven't you dad?
Have you got the
No, it's only one side.
Oh right.
So you get rubbers for it?
No, I'll get a new one, I thought I'd co 
Only 

time when I first came to .
And how old were you then?
I should say about six or seven.
What year would that be?
Tt Let's see, I'm sixty one now, so sixty one that's er twenty one isn't it?
Twenty one.
Yeah.
Twenty one ye Nineteen twenty one when I first came to .
But it had been just  just a wee little village then.
We had we had the two schools, the  School and the what we call the Boys School, that was the other one on on the green and it the girl's school, near this school, you started there as an infant between five and seven.
And then the girls stayed on till they were fourteen.
But when the boys became seven they they went on to this school on the green.
Now the village green in those days was all ashes, completely all ashes.
N not as it is today, beautiful green grass and we used to play er cricket, football, marbles er pitch card, ring tor, er duckie stone, and all  that of course the village in those days was divided into two parts and if you lived over  's Hill you was a downtowner.
And if you lived this end of the village you was an uptowner, see?
And we used to arrange football teams, cricket teams, during the before you went into school, playtime and very often when you came out of school.
But if you went over the hill, after school time, then you were in for a fairly rough time the other end, you were challenged and all sorts of things.
And of course there were no houses down where the village ha past the village hall in those days.
I think  Row was about the last row in  and of course you'd got all the fields, Gardens and what have you.
And there was nothing till you got to the Grange, absolutely nothing.
And there was just, well  Road, other than er the  Estate was pretty well the same as it is today, very little improved.
And the w the road might have been widened but the houses are the same and er the er of course with a lot of The old factories have been pulled down, Mills was pulled down, that was a v very prosperous f factory at one time, when I was a boy, but er I'm afraid that went according to you know  the lack of trade.
It was er The village centre is about the same as it was when I was a boy, more busier of course, all the private houses that were on the front, you know, Street?
That's all been altered,i they've all been made into shops  and spoilt the you know, the and there used to be old  's, the shoe shop and Mr.  's watch shop and Mrs  's pastry shop.
Mr , the bar local barber, who's son lives next door, for years, he used to start at nine o'clock in the morning and finish at nine o'clock at night.
Still cutting hair at nine o'clock at night and shaving people, penny and tuppence a time.
Old Mr , the old er, our only, as I could remember,centurian , died when he was a hundred and two.
He was going to have his hair cut w in every and a shave  Mr er  's barber shop right up until practically the morning he died.
And he did his own gardening, right up, when he was a hundred, he was fit as a fiddle when he was a hundred, doing his own gardening.
Where about did your family live?
The first house they lived in 
?
The first house that I can remember was on  Road.
That's just by where your friend lives.
lived in that house there and it was three shillings a week, I think it was, two up and two down.
One biggish living room and a little back kitchen with no water and no sanitation and if you wanted to dispose of your water you'd have to take it out on the roadside and chuck it down the main drain.
And you used to have to fetch your water from the pump's head, just round the corner, outside toilets, we used to have to go about fifty yards to use the toilet.
And then you'd share it with somebody else on the same row.
Yeah.
And it was  a fight for the f towards the end of the week it was a fight to  sort of say, Well,Shan't be able to move it,use it  until t the man comes.
But although in that house there was eight of us
That was your?
Mum and Dad and six kids, there was four in one bedroom, me sister, me and her my Me two sisters in the slept in in a double bed in me Mam's bedroom and we four lads slept in the back bedroom w w whi which was just just big enough to get a double bed in, as you can see, and there was two that slept at the top, and two slept at the bottom.
And you can guess what that was like with four four of us in bed,Hey    Wi move your feet.
And and of course y you didn't have extra blankets in those days, you had to fetch your Dad's topcoat up and put on if you're cold.
That's sort of business.
What did your Dad do for a living?
Well Dad, he worked  in the ammu in the munitions at Coventry, down  Lane for the Humber people, during the war.
That's how he g He's native is here, he's a native of , there was a very big sam family of them, about seventeen brothers.
And they always formed the  Village Church Choir,, see?
But he was tt er a twist hand in the hosiery trade, making  socks, and he worked in the last mobile, not mobile, er mechanical stocking manufacturers, owned by my uncle, Mr Frank , in  Street and th what we used to called  Street.
It was never known as  Street in those days, it was called the  Street.
And they had a big tt gas engine there with a great big flywheel and you can see these machines today, they didn't make them round, they used to make them flat.
See?
And i the bobbins an and that used to run across like that, the shuttle always used to run across like that
From side to side ?
Aye.
And er great big pulleys with three inch leather belts, if they'd have done it in, er do it in these days and the factory inspector would have cut him to pieces.
And I can see the o old father when he used to have s want to make the mo the machine immobile, while he did something particular to it, so like you switching the electricity off, well,h he used to have to take the belts off.
He used to get this brush handle and shove it in between the belts, like that, and  twist it off like that.
Then when he wanted it to go again he used to get the  th the belt, the leather belt, and er sort of hook it on to the lower end of the cast iron pulley and follow it round until it went on.
.And that's how they used to start the o and the old gas engine it used to pop pop pop, pop pop pop, pop pop pop pop.
.A y That was the last one  of the mechanized o Well, it was the only mo er mechanized stocking stockinger's shop in the village.
The rest was all hand operated, which was , was infested by stockinger's shops in those days.
That was the framework?
The framework 
knitters?
Yeah.
And you can You can see the n the buildings And there are one or two of them pulled down now.
I don't remember all I The last man I can remember working one was Mr , Joe , and he was down he The last one I can remember, as I say, was being operated in in the yard just down  Street.
Opposite to Mr where Mr Fred  used to live, at the back of his house.
That was the last one I can remember being worked there, but I do remember Frank , where me Dad worked.
Then of course, me Dad, when that closed down, it was like everything else, it's as bad as it is today, for jobs.
They couldn't get work and my poor old Dad went miles round these outside villages, on a a old lady's push-bike, trying to find work.
And the work they'd go for They were building their house, they'd v volunteer to take the footings out, or dig trenches to, or find out which farmer would have the threshing engine to do the, you know, to help them with the threshing, which was arduous work in those days.
Fetching coal and water for this  poor old steam engine , taking the chaff away, which was a filthy, horrible job.
. Carrying sacks of beans and s oats, up into the storage block in sixteen stone bags and twelve stone bags.
And how they used to They used to put them on like a You know what these two-wheeled barrows like they put the sacks on, don't you?
Well, it was a similar thing to that, only bigger.
tt They'd got two handles which was b made it mobile, two wheels, and used it Have four sacks at the end of this threshing engine, hanging on little hooks, and and a bloke there seeing that it got filled alright and it when it was full, they used to run this thing underneath a sack, crank it up by hand, like that, till they got it to the required height, then nestle it on their shoulders, you see there was a There's a there's an art in carrying c In carrying coal and there's an art in carrying corn and there's an art in carrying beef.
There's an art in carrying everything, which makes it easy, if you know how.
But if you don't know how, it'll kill you.
Same as all farm work, see, farm work They don't know as they're born these days, these youngsters don't, when they come to talking about farming.
used to have to w run the old b back the old horse and cart into the co crew yard which had been standing all year with about umpteen beasts on it, trampling it down, more straw, trample it down, more straw, trample it down.
Then in back end they used to empty this crew yard and you used to have to handle all that with forks, muck forks, they used to call them, and that was big biggest fork and by God, they used to pull your heart out.
You can guess what it was like, straw and everything, being trampled down all winter, sodden with with water and everything.
And then when that was done you used to have to take it to the field,and put it in we we used to put it in big heaps and then come back, fill it up, and then go out and spread it.
And 
So 
the o the old farmer used to go along with his one furrow plough, and a pair of good horses, and it was no mean feat.
I mean it th th they were called farm labourers in those days, but they weren't labourers, they were clever men, clever men, make no mistake about that.
I mean today, you've got to be an educated man to know how to even, they've got er tractors and everything, but in those days you'd got to set your plough furrow out so as you you could run your plough down your first one, and then as you as you ploughed your first furrow out you'd got to plough your next one into it.
Ten inch furrow.
And keep old Dobbin in his in his furrow.
One in the furrow and one on the stubble, see?
And you used to do that at a ten inch blade all day, up and down that field.
Day in and day out, today they can Same with old mowing machines, they used to go out To open a field up in those days, they used to have to go round with a scythe.
Go right round a f these the field and cut your first swathe out and tie it up with a a load of the straw that you'd cut and bind it up, bundle it up and shove that in the hedge bottom.
Then the old old binder used to come in with two two year old stalwarts, horses, and he used to go round this field and it used to take him days.
And then after the first seven or eight s cuttings, then they used to come along stooking.
You used to get two shears underneath your arm like that, and they used to  drop them down like that, across your knees and top them like that, see?
And you used to put eight to a stook, that was so it would dry out, you see?
And er and when that was been in the field whatever days, depending on the weather, if you'd got a good dry summer well you'd perhaps take it in in after a week, you see?
And then we used to and they used to come along with the old cart and start leading.
And when they'd finished milking at, they'd usually start milking about half past four in the morning, some of them used to go delivering milk and then they used to go leading.
What we call leading, that was picking your corn up.
And they'd knock off for a bit of dinner, come back, and do the second milking.
Wash your cans up erm and er and then they'd go and finish off in the corn fields.
And I used to go down you used to see all the mams and kids going down the moors here, taking their dad's tea, down in the fields, so they could have a bit of something and then finish as  got dark.
And then they'd wind their way home with the old port and everything.
And hay harvesting was a different kettle of fish altogether.
Admitting you went in the fields, but you didn't open the field up in th erm with a hay harvesting, you used to go in with your cutter, straight away.
Take , you didn't bother about the headlands, you'd do your headlands after you'd mown all your and then of course then that was left to dry, after two or three days, depending on the weather again.
You used to go in the fields and turn it and when it had been turned they used to start leading.
And i if the man in the field had got a grudge against a bloke who was stacking i or taking off in the stack yard he could make life hell.
Cos there's a way of putting hay on the cart and you used to have to start one lot in the corner, one lot in the other corner, another lot at the back, another lot at the back at the other side and then you'd fill in your centre.
See?
And when you'd got your centre filled in, you used to start again,, one in the corner, one the other corner, one between the eyes, one in the middle and back again.
Now if you'd got grudge against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop, in the farmyard, after when you got back home, of course you had to come I mean they didn't stick it in the field, like they do now.
You used to have to bring the stuff to the farmyard to store it, you see?
And if the old boy in the field had got a grudge against the bloke taking it off he used to shove it anywhere so he'd have to pull it off, instead of following the the seam round, you see?
By God it was hard, it was hard work in those days.
And see the same with mangle tagging,dunnet tagging, sugar beet pulling.
Sugar beeting in those days, you used to stick the old plough in, plough them up and then we had to go along knocking them, to knock all the soil off, then chop the tops off, put them in heaps, go along with the old horse and cart.
Load them up and then t take them to the heap  and ready for off again to the market.
did it, it was all road transported in them days.
M sh you see that I was saying, to be a farm labourer in those days you'd got to be a clever man, you'd got to know how much wheat to shove to an acre, no waste, you see?
You couldn't afford the waste.
Even though it was cheap in those days the farm farmer couldn't afford to waste it.
Oh no.
And then of course your sugar beet went direct to Colwick and it used to go by horse and cart in those days.
And er but your y mangles and your potatoes, they went in pits, in the field.
And of course you your mangles was for your a and your turnips for your Winter fodder.
And that was another d another task.
You used to have a special chopper for your mangles and it was like a big mincing machine, with a great big wheel on, and you used to fill it full of er mangles, or turnips and it used to come out like chips.
And then you used to mix it up with bran and oats and cake and that sort of stuff, for the horses.
An and then we used to have to and there was no no such a thing as bales in those days, duckie.
No such a thing as bales of straw, it was loose hay stacked, and you used to cut it with a big hay knife.
Oh, great big hefty thing it was, it was an art to cut hay, with these big knives.
And then we used When it g we used to fetch it off then like, cut it and then fetch it off in sheaths, like h , you know, like a big slice of bread.
And my God, again it was hard work, we used to put it in this hay chopper, pile it in and chop  and it used to come out like chaff.
And that was for your horses, you see?
An and they had to be fed.
The horse man used to have to go before anybody else, to feed the horses so that, and groom them, currycomb them, water them and do everything, before any of the farmers dare take them out on the fields.
Yeah.
So were these temporary jobs your father had on the farm?
They'd do anything, my duck.
Did you used to go and help on the farm as well?
Oh aye, of course you do, you had to do, you used to go tater- picking, my duckie, for one and sixpence a day.
And if you were lucky, and you got a good farmer, he'd let you take one o what we call roasters, home.
So you your Mam could shove them in the oven and roast them for you, take your own bucket.
You'd be, oh perhaps twenty or thirty of us, in these fields and you used to do so A length, what you call a length.
You'd perhaps have three of you picking up er the potatoes and then another length, another wat another lot of kids, another three used to do another length.
And then when the old spinney used to come up again,if you were lucky, he'd probably He had a probably a little wait before you'd finished the other, you see?
Keglet pulling.
Stone-picking.
Oh, singling, mangles, turnips, anything like that.
One and sixpence a day, but Mr   was the best paid, was two bob a day.
And we always u Everybody used to try and get to  's.
This was while you were still at school ?
This was while we were still at scho Well, you used to have a week off of school, my darling, for tater-picking, only.
When I was kids.
Did you do any other jobs, part-time 
Paper 
jobs while you were still at school ?
Paper boy.
Taking it out and all these what's name, half a crown a week.
On  Lane, walking it.
Come rain, come shine.
And you had to put it in the letter box, you daren't leave it in the in the .
Milk round, with the old ladle and jug.
And you'd be surprised what you had to put your milk in in those days.
Anything.
And we used to do that twice a day, my darling, not once a day, twice a day.
And then come and then wash your own cans out, and you used to carry them all through all round the village.
Then I got a bike, and I was alright then, I could put two milk churns on.
But you couldn't fill th the milk churns then, you used to have the half pint and pint measures, hanging inside your milk.
And it was milk, full of cream.
When you've got up next morni And then we I can tell you another thing, and very few people know about it, especially I bet you don't know wha what they called beastlings, do you?
Well in those days beastlings was a lux it wasn't a luxury because you could get it for nothing.
They used The farmers used to give them to you.
And it was milk, after they'd milked the cow first time, after she'd had a calf, well the first milking, they usually got blood in the milk, you see?
But the second milking, and so forth on, perhaps the thir second or third milking they used to get milk, what they called beastlings and it was very often too much for the calves to take, so she got a full bag.
So they had to draw it off, you see?
And if anybody had got a cow and it calved, we used to go to him and say could we have the beastlings, please.
Then your Mam used to make p pastry and put these beastlings in and make a beastling custard.
. And it was beautiful.
You didn't need you didn't need eggs in that, so forth and fifth, in that stuff.
Full of all the vitamins and everything.
You used to And then you could also go to the local farmer's and take away a quart jug, for two penn'orth of skimmed milk.
And that sort of thing.
Did your Mum do any sort of work at all?
Mum, she'd got to do, darling.
Six kids, Dad on a few shillings a week, when he was out of work, Mam had to go out scrubbing, washing.
My poor mother had got corns on across her her knuckles, right to the very day she died, from scrubbing for different people, and skivvying, up there.
these skivvies, in, what we called skivvies in those days, at these big houses up round a about the village.
Y you got about twelve and sixpence a w a year.
And w half a day a w a week and had to be in by nine o'clock.
My mother was was servant to , at the croft up there,about fifteen bob a week and she didn't know when she used to come home.
Eight o'clock in the morning till eight nine o'clock at night.
Cooking dinner, and if she got a what's-a-name,if they'd got parties on, she used to stop there had to stop there till two.
What happened to you kids while she was out working ?
we had to look after ourselves.
And if me Dad wasn't home at work,a out at work, he used to have to do it.
My father, six kids on a Friday night, we used to put a bucket of water on the hot sink, on the old gas stove and my father used to bath us six kids in front of the fire.
Friday night.
And never once on a Sunday morning did that man fail to get up and cook our breakfast and polish our shoes, so that we'd go smart and good to Sunday School.
Never once.
Yeah.
My poor old mother, and me sister finished at the same big house, servant there for them.
Same Oh.
And the mothers had to do it in those days, half a crown to do all the washing for this woman.
And you used to get up and light the copper fire, fill this old copper, which held about ten gallons, and then put plenty of stack o slack on it.
And it was there was no what's-a-name in there.
I can remember me first Mother's, what she called, automatic washer.
By God, I can remember that as if it was yesterday.
And it was a little square thing, about two foot square, with a er  and about eight inches deep, tt and you used to put the clothes in, with warm water and your your powder, close the top and you used to have a handle, and Like that there, and you used to be backwards and forwards, like that,, with this paddle going backwards and forwards inside it.
And that's what they called the first automatic washer.
Aye.
And of course they'd never They very rarely thought of washing clothes in tap water those days, it was all rainwater.
Every house had got it's own it's own rainwater tub.
And by God, it were a luxury if w you  washed out holding hot water first thing in the morning.
You used to go out in the in the wash-house and wash yourselves, under the cold water tap.
Up to the eyes in snow, up to the toilet which was about twenty yards away, that was where lived then, in the house where  Building Society is now, lived there for thirty four year.
Where's that?
On  Street.
Can you remember things that your mother used to do to make the money go further when 
I can.
when you were short?
Oh, yes, well I mean I o obviously I When she worked She used to get up I'll tell you another thing that she used to do.
She used to get up  in the morning, every Tuesday and Friday and catch the half past seven bus, from  to Nottingham and another bus down to  Boulevard, to Miss  's, do a day's skivvying and come back again, and then do her ironing and so forth, at night-time.
And my God, they weren't such facilities as er what's-a-name, if it was er wet weather.
You Every house had got lines across the the kitchen, you used to put hang the washing in the kitchen, to get it dry.
On the fireguard, above the fireplace,i there wasn't many houses that hadn't got a line across the fireplace, like that.
And you'd put handkerchiefs and collars and that, and you used to have to starch the collars in those days.
Robin's Starch, Beckett's Blue, and all this and that.
And then of course they used to iron them.
And it was hell's own job with sitting in the kitchen at night-time, a little kitchen, with washing hanging above your head, so the poor bugger could get it dry.
This was other people's washing that she took in ?
Aye.
And her own.
And we didn't We hadn't got a wash-house of our own, we used to have to go to Miss  's, down the road, to do our washing.
Borrow Miss  's.
Why was that?
You hadn't got We hadn't got a washing we hadn't got a wash-house.
Oh, you were lucky if you'd got a wash-house attached to your house, in those days.
You had to go to go to Miss  's and have it do it there, borrow her copper, and wringer.
Blimey, no, it was a luxury if you'd got a washer then.
And i and of course when she worked When Mum used to work in Nottingham you could er be assured that you'd have some bacon on a Saturday, and Sunday, because she used to call at T. N.  's in  Street, and buy sixpenny worth of bits of bacon.
Which was, say, when they'd started the the roll of bacon, there always used to be some little bits before they got the full rashers, well, you couldn't sell those, you couldn't s I mean even though things were tight in those days, you couldn't sell any sort of bacon, you either sold best back, or you sold belly bacon.
And the bits that you got off, well, we poorer families used to have it then.
Had to have that.
Eggs were twenty four a shilling, little little eggs, looked like bullet eggs, came from Egypt.
You still had to ask your Dad for a top off the egg if you were if you were a poor family.
So only your Dad got an egg?
On occasions, yes.
When he was in work, and then sh we used to go to the local butcher's shop on a Saturday night, with the old  bag, six o'clock Saturday night to Mr  's.
That's where  's is now on on the hill.
And my Dad used to say Go to Mr  's, and tell him you've come for your Dad's meat.
Half a crown and that's what you got.
Now half a crown in those days was a lot of money, you had to a full day's work for half a crown, make no mistake on that.
Half a crown And you used to come away with a big piece of flat brisket and if he's got any sausage left, or bits a of pork pies, he used to shove a bit of that in.
And Mr , me Dad wants to know if you've got a ham bone?
He says one day, me lad,if you don't come back quick, he said, I shall sell it, threepence, and there was a lot of ham of it, in those days.
Bones.
From the butchers.
Potherbs.
What?
Can you explain what potherbs is ?
Well, I told you what potherbs was, potherbs is what you buy, you go and you perhaps get a couple of sticks of c celery, that was taken off the side, you know?
The trimmings.
Carrots.
Parsnips.
Turnips.
Onion.
And they used to make two penny worth up and that's what they called potherbs, in those days.
Why they were called potherbs, don't ask me, but it was always known as potherbs.
Two penny worth of bones from the butchers, and two penny worth of potherbs.
Now that used to go in the old stew pot and they used to boil the bones till the meat dropped off, and the vegetables And that was your most of your meal for the rest of the week.
And in the morning you used to have soaky very few pe very few lads had breakfast, bacon and eggs, in those days.
It was soaky or porridge.
What's soaky 
Porridge?
Soaky?
Soaky was a basin full of bread, with sugar and milk and er a basin full of tea, with sugar and milk, and bread soaked in it.
And you used to have that, that was your breakfast.
And we Nestle's milk.
Nestle's milk conjures up a lot of memories for me.
. We had it in all ways, shapes and forms.
Spread on your bread, eat it by the spoonful, great big chunks of thick bread with Ho e home made jam,y your Mam didn't buy those jams in those days, me darling.
She made her own, did she ?
She made her own chutney, and made her own pickles, even though she was at work.
She used to make all the And er home-made wine.
And always in my attic, in our bedroom, as kids, you could always see dried dock leaves and dried stinking nanny, for poultices, for abscesses and boils.
Always.
And  tea.
You always had a  bush, that was horrible!
Detestable stuff, but my Dad always insisted that we had an egg cup full, once a week.
What was if for?
To keep your blood clear.
Mm.
And always on a Sunday morning, when you got up, Sunday morning, epsom salts.
A little, enough to cover a silver threepenny bit, in a saucer and some tea on it, and you just had to take it, drink it.
To keep your bowels right.
And as I was saying about all this, you're saying What did my Mother do to eke it out?
Eke the food out?
She used to go to the butchers and get breast of lamb, scrag-end, sheep's head, pig's head.
And if she got half a pig's head she used to cut the pig's head in half and used to use the top half, and that was where the ears was, and everything, boil it until all all the meat dropped off and then she used to put in er a big basin, scrumple it up in her fingers, put some of the juice in, and put a seven pound weight on it, and a saucer, and make brawn.
Now the bottom half,th it's j jaw, you used to boil that and make chap of it, pig's chap, and that was a luxury.
Beautiful.
You don't s see it today, but's it's beautiful.
What is it?
Pig's chap, it's a pig's pig's jaw, the bottom jaw.
Th this part here.
Cheek?
Y yeah.
Mm.
Pig's cheek.
But it's called pig's chap,in those days .
. And on a S Monday, it were always killing day at the Co-op, always killing day.
Then on a Tuesday, they used to make the black puddings, the plonney the scratchings, the potted meat, and they used to come on sale.
You used to see all the scratchings and all stu steaming hot, with the black puddings and the plonney shining like silver sixpences.
And the pork dripping, beef dripping.
Oh yes, it  was marvellous, that's how they used to make it, in those days.
Then they You dropped the old er breasts of lamb in the old stew pot, chop it up, and then if there was any left, me Mam used to take it out, so we could eat it cold.
Beautiful s er breast of lamb is, if you've never tried it, my duck.
Get a breast of lamb.
Get your butcher to bone it, make a nice stuffing, roll it up, wrap it in a nice bit of tinfoil, stick it in the oven and you've got a beautiful meal, me darling.
Or the old roast brisket.
Brisket.
You used to do the old brisket, in the saucepans, along with the potherbs and so forth.
Pearl barley, you don't hear pearl barley now.
By God, it was a must in those days, pearl barley.
Y 
What was it used for?
With cooking, like rice.
And we used to put it in stews.
You put it in stews, my duck.
Oh yes, and er of course mostly, in these outlying districts, you mostly grew your own vegetables.
And it was always a ritual for the gardeners to have new potatoes and peas ready for Wake Sunday.
When's that?
That was the last Saturday in July, the nearest Saturday to St Peter's.
And we always have used to have that on a Wake Sunday.
New potatoes, home grown new potatoes.
And s i if you were lucky, some ham.
Then on a Sunday night, the village, what they call wakes, they call them wakes in those days, not the village fair, it was the wakes.
Mr  used to open up his dragons and start his steam engine and driving the organ, and he used to give an organ recital every wakes' Sunday night for the  cot fund.
Cos we used to have support so many cots in the children's hospital, and we used to run concerts.
Mr Len , well known man.
was running all this for the Ruddington cot funds.
.was the fire brigade chief, was a newspaper man , and this was how we ran in this village.
We ran all sorts of little things, see?
And it was a very friendly little village.
My mother, apart from being a skivvying, she used to go out with along with Mrs , doing the hatched, matched and dispatched department.
Now, do you know what that is?
Well, that's the births, marriages and deaths.
And if anybody was sick, in those days, and they were nearly dying, we used to sit up with them, night after night.
And if they died, we us I  helping my moni my Mother many at time, to wash them down, before they put them in the coffins.
Put the false teeth in, and the pennies in the eyes, and and that sort of thing.
Did she get paid for doing that ?
Aye.
And then you'd send for Mr , the undertaker, or Mr , and he'd come along and measure and then make your coffin.
I've got my Mother's bill here, I'll show it you.
That was what, that was nineteen twenty eight, when I started work and I worked for  and M.
,House, Road.
And er I used to get se seven and sixpence a week, seven and sixpence a week.
And of course I wa I was due to learn the trade, I wasn't an apprentice.
I was due to learn the trade from start to finish with the with the idea of getting myself up to getting on the road.
So I started as an errand boy and half a crown a week was my bus fare, which give me, entitled me two journeys, a return journey each day.
From  to Nottingham ?
From  , it was fourpence, return.
Or if you wanted to go home for your dinner and go back again in the afternoon, well, that was four and sixpence, which entitled you to do a Saturday journey.
And you used to have a little ticket, with the days on, and they used to punch it with the old, you remember the old punching machines, don't you?
Well they used to punch your ticket, with a little hole in, so that they'd know you'd had your journey.
Now as I say, I started at that price and I used to have to help in the warehouse, in the packing and so forth, and then if there was any parcels to go into Nottingham I used to have to deliver them, by hand.
And carry them, either carry them, or push them on a two-wheeled trolley, all through the round the lace market to  's, and various other And if I were lucky, and the  's van was going round the lace market, and I'd got three or four parcels, I used to go with little Tommy and his horse and van, round the lace market, and he was delivering dress goods then.
And then he used to pick the undress goods up to go to G and W  's, still down  Road.
See?
And er of course, as years went by I got to a to be on the invoicing side, after that.
So you?
That was an office job was it ?
Yeah.
That was making the invoices out for the parcel.
Oh, and then I went u started as a packer after that, packing, which was an art, in those days.
H we had to pack hampers, and so forth, see?
And big parcels.
And then I went on invoicing.
And then from invoicing, I went into the factory, of course, to learn how the goods were made, which was very interesting.
You see the i it was er we used to make curtains then for Littlewoods, Littlewoods as it is now, they're still, you know, the they were about the  forerunners   of the er tt this er catalogue business, and if they gave us an order that would last us a long time, and that usually the eight points, which was meant to say there were eight threads to an inch.
That's how you measured curtains in the quality of the curtains was so many points to an inch.
The more points to an inch, the finer the goods were, you see?
If it was just a six point, or a seven point, then it was a real coarse one, cheap, for American markets.
But we used to Littlewoods used to give us an order, for one machine, or two machines, and you could keep your machine on this one particular set of curtains, without changing your jacks, without changing your beams, without changing your bodies, you could work straight on and on and on.
Well, they used to do them at fourpence ha'penny a pair, and each one must be put in a big envelope, so as it could go out on this catalogue business.
And that sort of stuff used to go to America, because in er we had quite a big American market in those days because they didn't wash curtains in America, they used to put them up until they dar until they dropped down and then put new curtains up, you see?
And er  we er tt  we er  we made er a lot of blackout stuff during the war, we had they called the Federation of British Industries, which was an annual fair at Birmingham, and my firm used to s used to exhibit there.
Bu and er  of course, most of your work was done from these Federation stores, stalls, Birmingham and London.
And I recall at the beginning of the war,they got a an almost light-proof black out curtaining, and I can re see it today, The Queen bought some, they were on exhibition.
Buckingham Palace I should say, not the Queen, but Buckingham Palace bought some.
And I can remember tenneyex telex coming through and we did our own er er signs in those days, you know, er advertising placards, it was red hot on the press.
Blackout curtaining, as bought by Buckingham Palace.
And of course, you couldn't keep pace with it, because Buckingham Palace had bought it you see, and it was good.
What were these blackout curtains made of, then?
Well it was er, a dense, thick, curtain, so dense that it was hardly visible, because in those days, during the first world war, during the thirty nine forty five war, blackout was essential.
You can't remember the blackout, can you?
You see the idea, was if you had lights in your house and there was just a kink, or chink, they used to call them in those days, they could be spotted from the air, so th You either had wooden shutters at your window, or blackout curtaining.
You weren't allowed to show any lights.
Even the, what few bits of lorries were on the road, they had a special mask on with er a shield over the top, so that the light wasn't visible up above.
Cos, probably you don't realize that, even a cigarette light,if you drew a cigarette, like that, and er and made it glow, it's visible for quite a few hundred yards in the darkness.
And consequently we was all subject, and you were fined very heavily if you were, if you tore these what's- a-names, blackouts, that's the name.
And then of course, we we also made the, at my firm, made the er Battle of Britain curtain, which was very famous, in those days, and I think they're still I used to have one but I don't know where the devil it went to.
Cos it, most of the things got lost during the war, you know?
Dra 
That was the 

the participants for H Two will have already discovered, we are still tackling part of H One from yesterday, but, and I apologize that you will have to sit through the outstanding items of discussion.
On the other hand, you will have gathered already that we are going to talk about Greater York, so I think there may be some distinct benefit and merit in you being he here to listen to that, er particular part of the topic, now the, I hope in fact that we can deal with the remainder of H One, because it it does lead quite logically into the next issue which we want to talk about, which is the new settlement in the Greater York area, er and I hope that we can get through this item by our morning break, that but whenever we do conclude on H One we will have to have a slightly longer break just to enable the seating arrangements to be sorted out properly for all participants who are involved in the discussion on the new settlement.
Now can I er also suggest to you that in discussing this one outstanding item of the housing land allocations, we pursue virtually the same sort of approach that we did yesterday, er and in fact if you look at what is set down under matter One D for discussion, it says is the provision proposed for the Greater York area including the new settlement appropriate etcetera, and in fact when you look at the first item for discussion under the Greater York new settlement issue, we come straight into, does Greater York new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response, etcetera.
So what I'm going to ask effectively that when we are talking about the Greater York element of the housing land allocation we concentrate on the question of is the level of provision enough?
And we know there are various er responses to that question, and I would be looking to the districts to say whether or not they could cope with the various levels of provision that have been identified for Greater York, and it's the view of whether they can cope within their own districts, I haven't said how you can cope, I said whether you can cope, you might I will I will leave you free to make the odd comment, but I want to focus on that part of the issue, and then the natural corollary to that is, will it be necessary, or is it considered necessary in the context of this alteration to provide specific guidance within H One policy for the distribution of that er development to er at sub, what I would call sub-district level, in other words do you want a specific entry for say Ryedale or Hambledon?
Has anyone got any questions on that approach?
Is it clear how I'd like to play it?
Er so with no more ado I will ask Mr Davis for North Yorkshire to present his opening statement, and then I'd like Mr Curtis, your moment has come Mr Curtis, er to to follow on from Mr Davis.
Thank you.
Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, erm I'd just like to make five brief points in response to the issues that have been raised erm on One D.
The first of those points is the principle of a Greater York dimension to the structure plan, erm we'll all probably be aware that in the original structure plan the Secretary of State wasn't prepared to accept a Greater York dimension in the structure plan, but did accept with the support of the district councils on the first alteration, the inclusion of a Greater York dimension.
Having that Greater York dimension has certainly allowed progress to be achieved dramatically in Greater York, erm, it's led to progress towards progress towards green belt definition, and more importantly it's led towards resolution of future strategy for Greater York.
Er we at the County Council think that to delete that Greater York erm dimension would take us back to the realms of uncertainty, past uncertainty, in the Greater York area, we're therefore proceeding with a Greater York dimension in policy H One at none thousand seven hundred dwellings, which equates to hundred percent migration.
The second point I want to raise is the issue erm of the green belt, er which is er a constraint in Greater York erm we've made significant progress in moving towards the statutory definition of the green belt, the green belt local plan has now completed erm its public enquiry, and a lot of the deliberations in Greater York have centred around the effect on of the green belt on development potential in Greater York, so that is a main issue, I think, in response to issues, the discussion of issues in Greater York.
The third point which has come out in a number erm of comments, certainly from the C P R E is the issue of overshoots in the approved structure plan in respect to Greater York, and as we made clear in paragraph eight of our er erm position statement, we accept that there has been in numeric terms in the period eighty one to ninety two something like fifteen percent overshoot in terms of completions er in that period.
We would wish to stress again, with the district council's support I suspect, that that overshoot really it's to sites within the urban area, as in windfall sites in general planning terms we have seen to be acceptable er in planning terms, but we would wish to stress that part part of that approach has been a continuing resistance to development on greenfield sites on the edge of the the urban area.
The fourth point, Chairman, er is the new settlement issue, and while that's due for discussion on policy H Two, that issue does shall I suggest invade policy H One, because an appropriate form of words has to be agreed in policy H One to reflect the new settlement issue and as you'll be aware the County Council is about a step by step approach towards the finalization of the new settlement erm strategy for Greater York, and then finally, a specific issue that you mentioned is the distribution of developments between the Greater York districts er within Greater York, now as you'll be aware Chairman, that has been done informally, following the original structure plan in nineteen eighty the County and the Districts got together and agreed the distribution of housing and employment land in Greater York.
Following the first alteration, when the Secretary of State approved the Greater York dimension, that matter was resolved amicably between the County and the Districts erm through the er Greater York study, so the issue therefore is there a need for more guidance for the structure plan, to break down the Greater York figure to individual Greater York districts, and our view quite clearly er is the answer that the answer to that is no.
Certainly it would be very difficult to introduce any statistical rational erm to the desegregation of Greater York to its district components, bearing in mind the small populations er in some of the Greater York er districts, we think that the general level of detail erm in the structure plan is appropriate, and we think to go down to any finer detail would be an inappropriate to a structure plan, and thirdly I think on that issue, er we would think that it would prejudice erm the work that District Council would want to do erm in their er local plans.
So those, Chairman, are the five points er that I wanted to raise on Greater York, and obviously we will be interested to hear the response round the table today.
Can I ask Mr can I ask Mr Davis to give us a bit more explanation, please, as to his rationale behind continuing resistance to the development of greenfield sites on the edge of York.
Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, erm I think the clear answer to that is that districts, erm and county, erm were very aware of the greenbelt constraints on greenbelt sites
But
erm adjacent to the urban area.
Are you saying that greenfield development on the edge of York would be in the greenbelt as you have  defined it in the deposited local plan.
I'm talking about the the overshoot, and my comments about greenfield sites were related to period eighty one to ninety two, and it became quite clear during the eighties that the sketch plan green belt or development was at that time, through the eighties, was by and large abutting onto the urban area, that er through the eighties what everybody understood to the sketch plan green belt was tight up against er the urban area, so in resisting urban greenfield sites erm on the urban edge through the eighties the County Council were recognizing the greenbelt constraints.
That isn't quite the question I asked.
Unless you are telling me that the sketch greenbelt local plan is the same as the deposited greenbelt local plan
Well
is there land between the current edge of development in York and the inner edge of the greenbelt which is as yet undeveloped?
Yes, and then that approach was taken on through the Greater York study, and in the greenbelt local plan, and the Greater York study identified a number of sites.
Part A goes ninety one to ninety six, part B ninety six to two thousand and six, sites adjacent to the urban area in the Greater York study er which were acceptable for development because corporately the districts and the county did not think that those sites discharged a greenbelt function as the greenbelt local plan was progressed those sites were excluded from the greenbelt erm and yes, we did identify a number of sites which did not conflict with greenbelt objectives erm on the urban edge.
Are those sites within the City of York administrative area or other districts?
The the bulk of them erm I think almost without exception are erm in adjoining districts, around York, the significant contribution from York that we identified in the Greater York study, erm largely comes from from windfill windfall sites, by and large.
Which districts, please.
Erm the the bulk of the erm erm commitment erm or the or the sites that we identified, er would be in would be in Ryedale district, in South Ryedale .
Thank you, thank you.
Mr Curtis.
Thank you Chair.
David Curtis, York City Council.
I think some of my er introductory comments might now be  inspector, er understand the er sort of urban situation, erm we heard yesterday about er discussion about the similarities between different districts in North Yorkshire and the possible differences.
I think everyone around the table would accept that in this situation York is unique.
York's a historic city of some hundred and four thousand people, covering some two thousand nine hundred hectares, but that city itself is only part of the settlement that I think we would all regard as as York itself, that covers a larger population of some a hundred and thirty five thousand people, er contained er within the York outer ring road, and referenced to the the map submitted with my H One submission, and also the greenbelt plan which we've we've just put up on the board there, er will show you the the broader extent of the urban area.
Clearly in that situation the city of York is highly constrained, it's a modern industrial city with a very tight medieval core, a historic core which is is world renowned, but a historic core which actually only covers four percent of the built area of the city itself, when we look at that wider area erm the central historic core together with the eight other conservation areas in the city and conservation areas in the remainder of the urban settlement comes to some thirteen percent of the urban area.
Furthermore we have a series of major landscape features, er which are been referred to in the greenbelt local plan and elsewhere as wedges, which you'll see from the map enter into the very heart of the city itself.
Some six hundred hectares of that land is actually designated as greenbelt, but in addition within that a number of those areas are er prevented from development in perpetuity we'd argue because a large part of that area has got a historic status as stray land, which is a form of common land, which means it's actually not not available for any form of development, similarly the flood planes of the river Ouse in particular is for physical development reasons er prevented from development in many areas, and those of you who were here this weekend will have no noticed the reason why, it was a flooding that took that took place on the Ouse valley, in addition to those constraints, open space within the city is at a premium erm the city falls below the Emperface standard, erm by er something like erm half a hectare per thousand population, so compared with the Emperface standard of two point four per thousand, the city reaches a quite a generous erm categorization of the recreational space we have available, only a total of two hectares per thousand, therefore, and this is very relevant to the Greater York debate, erm, really the only land for development within the city is recycled land, there are limited number of er sites which have not been developed in recent years erm which can be identified for development, and are being identified for development in our draft local plan.
But the majority of of any development land in the city would be recycled, either from housing uses or industrial uses.
The draft of the city wide local plan will be going to the city council in December, and  prove of the consultation, but the figures some of you've seen in our evidence have been a agreed by the the local plan steering group, who sit in council members er across party, committee which has agreed the basic numbers, so the draft allocations which are in our submission, and which we have seen in the  schedules yesterday, are accepted as a basis for consultation by the city council but are clearly subject to review.
Turn turning then to just touch on the issues that I've, we didn't cover yesterday for York, erm you'll notice from our H One submission we have a slight difference of opinion with the County Council on the technical side of the er the calculation, we believe that the calculation, we believe that the calculation for York's need rather than three three should be a four thousand figure, taking into account the the issue of concealed households and involuntary sharing.
However, that doesn't have an effect on our er ability to agree a figure of three three for the city itself, in the structure plan, because the work we've done on the local plan taking into account commitments and suitable allowances for small sites, does indicate to us that a figure of three three is achievable, but would be extremely difficult to exceed, the difference here between the four thousand and the three three does, however, have an impact on our neighbours clearly, and as was mentioned yesterday the City Council does own some some twenty nine hectares of land outside its current boundary, er located in the Ryedale District Council area, that land, some of that land has planning consent, the remainder is allocated in the draft Southern Ryedale local plan and was excluded from the greenbelt, that land it is the City Council's intention to use to meet its er requirements for affordable housing, could accommodate some seven hundred dwellings, I think it is very important for me to emphasize that that is a very clear commitment of the City Council, and therefore that land in Ryedale would not er in the majority of its case be available for open market use, we would be seeking to use it to meet er affordable housing requirements.
Er the other point I would make about the the figures under H One, really is that erm the twelve thirty figures that you've seen in the tables is our best estimate at the present time, based on the site survey we've carried out.
That is a very comprehensive survey, erm I wouldn't envisage any additional sites being recommended by the City Council, er at the present time, although clearly some of the sites may be suggested by by a private developers and landowners during the consultation process.
It is quite possible clearly that that number could be reduced, during the consultation process on the on the local plan, I think that's an important point because of the issue of windfall that was mentioned by Mr Davis, and was raised yesterday, reference to historic trends in the city of York do show that erm we have exceeded structure plan targets by substantial amounts, I think the figure is is forty percent or or more, er the County Council could confirm that, slightly difficult calculation to do because I'm sure you'll be aware that to our eternal shame, the City Council has not to date adopted a formal local plan, with reference erm to your question on day one er as to whether or not we might calculate contribution of windfalls in the past, we have looked at the nineteen eighty seven residential land availability er study, which was agreed with the house builders, adjacent districts, and of course the County, and in the five year period of that study, by comparison with the sites that we agreed in the study, an additional four hundred and thirty dwellings came forward and were completed on sites that had not been identified in the study, now I'd I would say very clearly that that level of windfalls erm would not continue in the future and it could not be a reliable basis for erm looking at windfall contributions in the city in the future, clearly the supply of development land in the city is a is a finite resource, er given given the constraints that are current holding, and although some additional windfalls to the two hundred I'd suggested in my H One  may come forward, on the other hand I suspect some of the sites suggested in the draft local plan could fall out of the equation.
Just turning briefly to the issue of affordable housing, you'll see from my H One submissions the City Council has a target, er which is in the the York area housing strategy, which is currently with the D O E for its consideration, of something like a hundred and fifty dwellings a year, giving over the fifteen year period a two thousand two hundred target, how we will go about achieving that is primarily, where it's possible using land we already own, or is in ownership of housing associations, and taking into account the the seven dwellings outside the current city boundary, we believe in total they will contribute some fifteen hundred dwellings towards that two thousand two hundred target, this will leave clearly a significant shortfall, and it will therefore be necessary to to seek to negotiate, if I can use the terms of P B G 3 erm with house builders as sites come forward in in the local during the local plan period.
Turning now very briefly to the H One D the Greater York issue, clearly the comments I've made about the calculations for York have a knock on effect for our position on Greater York, the Greater York figures as I understand it from the County Council are based on a one hundred percent migration assumption, if the technical difference between us er we are right then we believe clearly the Greater York figure should be increased by an appropriate amount, and the we've suggested the increased cut should be seven hundred er relating to the city itself I can't calculate with any great accuracy what the figure for the surrounding parts of Greater York might be, but it would be we suspect only another one to two hundred more on top of that, therefore that underst explains the reason why the City Council suggests that the Greater York should be increased to the ten four figure from the nine seven.
The other concern in the City Council's evidence on H One er is this issue of distribution, I note Mr Davis's comments about the difficulties of subdividing the Greater York allocation between different districts, and I I do acknowledge the difficulty in relation to Harrogate, and particularly Hambledon which obviously has a very small proportion of Greater York, on the other hand both Ryedale and Selby do contain a substantial proportion of the Greater York population, er based on my calculations of their er proportion of the population of Greater York which admittedly is a somewhat crude way of of doing estimates, but in the absence of of any other projections that was really the only way to do it, my estimate is that the er compared with the nine seven target of County Council would take in the could potentially be seen to be taking a share of four thousand two hundred in Ryedale and seventeen hundred for Selby, if you base it on their existing population distribution on er part  outside the city, now I'm not saying necessarily that's how the way you would do it, but I I think it's an indication that the scale of development in those two districts is quite significant in Greater York, our concern is that the policy as it currently stands does not give any real guidance as to the way in which distribution of development outside the city, but in Greater York, erm can be er should be di divided up, and I think the problem really occurs from the introduction of the new settlement into H One, erm I don't want to stray into the H Two debate  Chair, but I think it's the fact that H One does include a figure for the new settlement, that the new settlement is not located within any particular district, but that all the district totals do include in effect a figure which is undetermined at this stage, that that would be absorbed by the new settlement, as I understand the policy at the moment, and I think that really does introduce a problem, erm because clearly all of the emerging districts wide local plans could be in conformity with the structure plan and not include the new settlement, I think it's er interesting to note that the the D O E's recently published a good practice guide, on development plans, did particularly highlight the situation in Greater York, as a problem, as a shortcoming of the existing plan, and if I can just quote it, it does say this, on page forty three, it would seem appropriate for broad locations of new development to be established by means of an alteration to the structure plan.
So we have suggested, erm, you will see in our evidence that policy H One should be amended and their are clearly a number of ways in which that amended amendment could take place, but we would particularly suggest that erm an indication should be given as to what the proportion of each district's allocation is assumed to be going to the new settlement, if the new settlement is is agreed under the H Two discussion, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr Curtis.
I mean effectively what you're saying is that York has got a capacity for about another three thousand three hundred dwellings?
Yes.
Over a whole range of sites.
After 
Yes.
that you're really straining, almost to get a gallon into a pint pot, never mind a quart, aren't you?
David Curtis, York City Council.
Yes, that is correct, sir.
Does that include all land within the city boundary not included in the greenbelt?
Yes.
David Curtis, York City Council.
Yes it does, the there is as you will see from the greenbelt plan,a apart from the issue of the fact that the the city boundary is in many areas er sort of hard up against further urban development so there's no space between the city and the parts in adjacent districts, the greenbelt boundary, as currently proposed by the County Council, erm which as you'll see from our evidence is not a boundary supported in its entirety by the City Council, means there is no further development land between the city boundary and the greenbelt.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think I'll ask Mr Smith from Ryedale to  tell us a little more about Ryedale's problems or efforts
Thank you.
to cope with the pressures from York city itself, and the Greater York area.
Ian Smith, Ryedale District.
Erm Ryedale District, as can be seen from the table supplied by Greater York, has taken the largest proportion of the Greater York housing element over the past ten years, as regards the proposed level of future housing growth suggested for the Greater York area, the District Council supports the figure in the structure plan, the Greater York study identified a number of sites around the Greater York area which could accommodate further development without compromising greenbelt objectives or adversely affecting the character of the settlements surrounding York, and within that part of Southern Ryedale within the Greater York area the identified sites were, by and large, incorporated into the Southern Ryedale local plan, which has recently been through the public enquiry, the District Council does not believe that a larger amount of land could be identified within Southern Ryedale, without compromising greenbelt objectives.
As regards the distribution of lands between the districts, erm if I can refer to Mr Curtis's comments first, the Greater York study never anticipated that the distribution of housing around the Greater York the districts would be based around the percentage of population within those districts, but purely on capacity of sites within those districts to accommodate future housing growth without compromising greenbelt objectives, Ryedale, as I've said before, has taken the largest proportion of recent housing in the Greater York area, and has identified a substantial amount of new land for housing within its Southern Ryedale local plan, what the District Council is concerned about is that within the local, Southern Ryedale local plans, this is taking a large proportion of its district wide total plans, yet the District Council from the structure plan figure given is unable to calculate the remainder of housing that should be allocated in the remainder of its district.
What Ryedale is seeking is not a figure for its sector within the Greater York area, and the same with the other districts, but rather a figure for the Greater York area as a whole, and then a figure for the remainder of those parts of the districts outside the Greater York area, so you don't get a situation with my colleagues on the left where you are in the structure plan dictating the number of houses that should be allocated in, for example, two parishes.
I follow the I follow the er the point, but the thing that puzzles me is that your South Ryedale local plan allocations have arisen out of the discussions on the Greater York study, yes?
That is correct, yes.
Where do you go post two thousand and six, for example, in obtaining a strategic view about the distribution of growth around York, and in the Greater York area.
I mean, how is that going to be provided?
How are you going to be given, and I'm making an assumption, of course that the present two tier planning system is still prevailing?
Stick with that scenario, how, how would you anticipate, or how would you expect that strategic guidance to be given as to where development should be appropriately located to serve the needs of Greater York, what mechanism is there in place for being 
I it's 
given that guidance?
Ian Smith, Ryedale District Council.
Erm beyond two thousand and six, I would have thought the strategic guidance would be in locations other than peripheral expansion around the Greater York area, which I would have suggested would would more than likely be to new settlements.
Can I pursue  erm any fact no more without compromising greenbelt objectives, no more than that, er you said a couple of times.
I th I'm not challenging that, I simply wish to be clear what you mean by it.
Two questions.
Does that mean no more without development in the deposited greenbelt, as in the greenbelt as defined in the deposited greenbelt local plan, or does it mean no more unless it is hard up against that greenbelt?
And secondly, to which greenbelt objectives did you refer?
Ian Smith, Ryedale District Council.
Er to answer the first answer the first of your two questions, erm, the greenbelt as defined in the greenbelt local plan is hard up, in many respects, against the edge of the built up area, excluding allocated sites, allocations above that within the Southern Ryedale area would in fact require redrawing green in a green belt boundaries.
But there is allocated land, allocated undeveloped land, between the existing urban edge and the inner edge of the greenbelt?
Yes, where, sorry, Ian Smith, Ryedale District, yes, er where it was considered those allocated sites could be developed without extending development into the greenbelt.
Thank you.
Mr Davis, and then Mr  .
I'm sorry there was a second question .
Oh sorry, yes.
Erm the greenbelt objectives which we identify with or could be compromised by significant peripheral expansion, or the expansion of a settlement within the greenbelt, were primarily the effecting the setting of the historic city, which we and the County considered and refer to more than just the green wedges, and but involve the whole countryside, and the setting of the settlements within the greenbelt around the Greater York area, expansion of lar large urban areas into the countryside, possible coalescence of settlements.
Not the historic city itself?
Yes er  it the first, yes, setting of the historic city .
How would you describe the setting of the historic core of York.
Erm, it's a city,this takes me back a few months, since the Southern Ryedale local plan enquiry, the character, special character of a city, is derives from a number of elements, there's the green wedges which centre on the strays which penetrate into the heart of the built up area, there is the encircling belt of open countryside which links those areas together, there are the numerous settlements within the greenbelt and their relationship to one another, and to the city of York.
There are a number of viewpoints of the city from the ring road
Yes.
erm, in some of which the Minster is clearly visible,
Mhm.
in a setting of suburban, industrial, residential development, and some of those viewpoints on the ring road all one can see is the suburban, industrial, and residential development.
Ian Smith,Ry 
That's what were aiming to preserve, is it?
Well, Ian Smith Ryedale, I think in the majority of views across from the ring road you have a belt of open countryside before that suburban housing.
What you yo were trying to achieve is the expansion of the built up area towards the ring road, and thereby having built development hard up er as it is at the moment the ring road goes through for the most part open countryside on either side of it.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mr Davis.
Very briefly, Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, you raised the issue of procedures looking at the er post two thousand and six scenario within the light of er a statutory greenbelt er at that time, and I would envisage that the County Council and the Districts, if indeed we're all er in business at er er in in in the next century, would probably want to run a similar sort of exercise that they  would be ran through the end of the eighties, and that is to sit down together, er and look at all the options, er that are available for Greater York, in the same way that they did it in ninety eighty nine, one additional factor at that time would be that er the greenbelt would be statutory, and it would be statutory if the County Council and ninety five percent of the district support on sites would be a tight greenbelt so the options would be looked at erm er in that context, on the comments that er Miss Whittaker, erm questions that Miss Whittaker raised, there is a paper that the County Council produced for the greenbelt local plan enquiry that I remember well as N Y Two, which set out in detail the various components, erm of the York greenbelt in addition to the historic title that the that the focus of the green belt comes across a variety of of of of matters, and if it if it is helpful to this panel that document was acceptable by and large, supported by the District, we can certainly put that in, and can circulate it round.
Yes, yes please, if you would.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Grigson.
Steven Grigson from Barton Willmore.
Sir, I would want to come back I susp 
Can you?
I will want to come back, I suspect later on.
Am I on?
Thank you.
I want to make a limited point at this juncture, I reserve the right to come back later on, and it's become three points as a result of the discussion we've already had, my view on the contribution of the of the greenbelt to the York issue isn't just the setting of the city, it's the character of the city, and that would include the central city and the historic city, and the need to limit the physical expansion and size of the urban area because of the implications inside the historic city, and that would certainly apply to other cities with greenbelts that I'm familiar with like York, like er Oxford, which the character suffers from expansion, possibly excessive, Norwich, that considered a greenbelt, and London, if you like that didn't get its greenbelt until we had the character rather drastically altered, so I think it isn't just the setting and how you see the city from the ring road, it's actually what happens inside the core, the second point I want to make is really for clarification perhaps, er and it relates to the question of allocations between the built up area and the inner edge of the  greenbelt, as I understand it all those allocations are already er included in the Ryedale local plan, and are already therefore included in the commitments that we looked at in Ryedale, I don't think there is a further reserve of spare opportunities that might be used either before or after two thousand and six, that's certainly my understanding and if anybody was was taking a different view I think that should be clear, and now I come to the one point that I was actually going to raise, erm I think it's important that in this discussion of the relations between York city and Greater York, that we get a, early on, a clear view of what the requirements are in York, not just its capacity which we've discussed so far, and a figure of three thousand three hundred seems to be a fairly common currency, but its requirements, and I want to address a particular question to the County Council, which is in my proof, so they've had as it were four weeks notice of it.
And that is that in the projections of housing requirements for the City of York, not Greater York but the City of York, the County Council have a figure of four thousand four hundred households extra, but propose a provision of only three thousand three hundred dwellings extra, that's purely within York, and the question really therefore for the County Council is I had thought that their dwelling requirements, that their, sorry their their policy H One figure for York was what they thought the requirements were, but maybe it's what they think the limited capacity is, and they are foreseeing an overspill of thousand odd from the city of York into Greater York.
Mr Spittle.
Malcolm Spittle  the figures in policy H One are quite clearly referred to as provision that will be made in particular settlements, they are not stated as the the requirement for dwellings generated by that particular settlement, erm, that is quite clearly set out in policy H One, that is the wording of the policy.
If the city cannot provide mo , physically more than three thousand three hundred it would not be wise to include a figure of four thousand, five thousand, six thousand, dwellings within the city, that would be misleading and would not provide clear guidance to any local authority in the preparation of their local plan.
I don't think that was the point Mr Grigson was making.
Well the 
for clarity is that the actual projected requirements, as a series of projections produced by County Council are for four thousand three hundred households, and a projected requirement for three thousand three hundred dwellings, well quite clearly if the City of York itself cannot accommodate the requirement generated from in that city, then it must be looked at in relation to the whole of the Greater York area, and the projections of the Greater York area do take into account the er the figures generated from within the City of York, therefore, yes, they are included within the Greater York figure.
Do you accept, Mr Spittle, as Mr Grigson says, the projected on a tr on a trend statistical projection, the figure of households for York city is four thousand four hundred?
The figure I think that we, yes I wonder if Mrs Long could re  to that particular question ?
Yes.
Mrs Long, North Yorkshire County Council.
Wait a minute, pull the microphone towards you.
Mrs Long, North Yorkshire County Council.
I did the demographic projections, erm, I think the difference that, er, Mr Grigson is talking about between dwellings and households comes about within the ability of the Chelmer model to input, erm, tt, calculated dwelling requirements.
Now I did it in one method and Mr Grigson did it in er in a second method, and the ability to do that changes the number of households that it would project to the er the dwellings, and cancels out, this makes judgements erm on the actual population projections based, which are estimates that have come out, I don't necessarily believe the best measured estimates have come out for York, and have adjusted some of the figures in accordance with that.
Now I'd like to emphasize this as because within York area it saw a difference between the census counts to the actual base population of a growth of five point seven two percent.
This is more than the change that inner London received, and I think it's quite unbelievable that York's population, base population is actually starting of from the figure of er a hundred and three, a hundred and four thousand, and I think York City Council will agree with that in any case, erm, the new major estimates for nineteen ninety two would already suggest that that population's declined by a further thousand, which I think emphasizes that these major estimates are estimates, and because of the differ the difficulties within the census for nineteen ninety one, with under enumeration, some problems may have occurred.
Erm, so I'll agree with Mr Grigson that we do suggest there are more households changing their own dwellings, but it's simply because we're trying to iron out of the problems that we feel have occurred within the major estimates.
What's your projection for the city?
In terms of additional households, ninety one, two thousand and six, please.
Erm, just one moment please  four thousand two hundred.
Four?
Four thousand two hundred.
Thank you.
Mr Grigson, is that moving in the direction which you wished to get an answer to your question?
Well it, it, it, it's moving a bit in that direction, I mean I knew what their prediction was cos they kindly supplied it to me, which is why I made the point, but I mean as as you know from our proof we have a higher view of the demographic requirements in York even than that, for reasons that were amply discussed in general on on day one, to do with vacant dwellings, mortality, and I think still probably a difference in migration between us on York, which is statistical rather than environmental, but I think it is important to to have that established early on that that even in the County Council's view, and with their, as it were, doubts about the statistics which they themselves use, that er there is more need generated in York, however much it is, than York itself can accommodate, and that is of course without York city's seven hundred addition for reducing concealed and sharing households which is not in the County Council's figures.
Yes, er  I see from the supplementary proof which you have put in the other day, I mean your calculations of York's requirements is six thousand six hundred.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No doubt we will return to that.
Mr Donson.
Thank you.
Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation.
I'd like to take up some points as they've occurred this morning.
Erm, the first point relates to erm affordable housing targets in York, and the consequences that that has in relation not only to York but other areas, on the on the assumption that that there is, there has to be an overspill to to adjou adjacent areas.
Erm, I heard Mr Curtis say that the shortfall of affordable houses was seven hundred, he had a target of two thousand two hundred and felt they could find fifteen hundred somewhere already, so another shortfall of of seven hundred  that actually contrasts with para' four one one of the one eleven should I say, four one eleven, of the York housing strategy, which has been submitted, and appendix four of the York evidence which actually says that, yes there's a two thousand two hundred target, but there would still be a shortfall of about one thousand one hundred dwellings if this land, they're talking about land that they own outside of York, is developed for affordable housing.
Well there seems to be a slight mismatch there, and perhaps some of this mismatch is also a part of, with the confusion I have of the various shifting policy of York, in term in terms of their requirement, there has been in the in the not too recent recent past York were saying they had an additional requirement beyond need which they termed their concealed requirement, although it might not be a concealed dwellings, as we might otherwise describe them, of one thousand six hundred, and that has progressively come down to seven hundred as presented at this enquiry.
Now it seemed to me that one thousand six hundred was  initially as a result of survey work or shall we say investigation into the housing waiting list carried out by the York housing department, and I have to say that I have a certain respect for the York housing department, and they have a certain reasonable and good reputation within the region as a housing department, and so there seems to me that there is a gr a there is a potential to underestimate er the the affordable requirement that's been put to you, another point erm I'd just like perhaps to seek a little clarification from Mr Curtis, was was unfortunately I was looking something else up or my attention was diverted when he gave some figures for Ryedale and Selby, I think he said, and I'll happily stand corrected on this, that if you take away the York requirement figure from his ten thousand four hundred for Greater York, then the remainder he would apportion to Selby and Ryedale, so that Selby got four thousand two hundred, sorry, so that Ryedale got four thousand two hundred and Selby got one thousand seven hundred, erm that doesn't add up to ten thousand four hundred and I I I in total, and I I wondered where the rest was coming from, if I  the point correctly.
My note indicates that what Mr Curtis said was that on a pro rata to their existing 
Yes.
population levels i in the area of Greater York, an allocation would suggest that, he wasn't advocating that, it was just a pro rata ball park estimate, and he didn't purport to make it add up to the residual requirement  okay ?
It's it's still one thousand two hundred dwellings short, and I don't know where there going to go.
Mr Curtis.
Thank you Chair.
David Curtis, York City Council.
There's a few issues I'd like to cover from a number of comments, I'll I'll 
I'm sorry.
You hadn't finished?
No I hadn't.
Alright,
hold your horses then Mr Curtis.
to two points
You can pick that
Do you want those picked up?
No?
Yes, my other points about Ryedale anyway.
Er yes Chair, first of all the the last point first as it were, the erm Senior Inspector is quite correct what I was doing was allocating the nine seven figure that the County had proposed in H One, er that's why it doesn't add up add up to ten four, clearly I haven't done the calculations for ten four, but on the basis that erm there are seven hundred extra dwellings going into Ryedale, I think Mr Donson can work that one out.
Erm in connection with erm with reference to the York area housing strategy, again, there is a simple explanation, in that that that document was prepared before the current work on the City of York draft local plan, had progressed to a stage at which members had considered housing sites, and a number of sites in City Council ownership erm within the city, covering some four hundred dwellings have now been agreed by the City Council members as coming forward over the planned period for affordable housing, and in the case of two of those sites it actually requires sites to be taken out of use as public car parks, to bring them forward for development, and that is why the eleven hundred figure is actually reduced now to to a seven hundred.
Thank you.
Mr Donson, do you want to continue now?
Er yes, thank you very much.
Sorry, my my my other point is about about Ryedale, and and and its its and its its unde its relationship to Southern Ryedale, and erm Mr Smith said that erm as far as Ryedale Council are concerned they can't identify any more land within Southern Ryedale, well of course they would say that because was there position at the Southern Ryedale plan, but the fact of the matter is that there was a great dispute at the York greenbelt Southern Ryedale plan enquiry,revol resolving around the issue of what were the bits of the greenbelt which made up the historic character and thereby what were you left with that potentially could be developed, albeit it might be reserved as white land in the first place, but could potentially be developed, and a great deal of this land on the disputed side lay in Southern Ryedale, that in that in fact there was a view around the table not only sh not only shared by by the developers side, but erm that large parts of Osbaldwick and Huntingdon didn't fall within the definition of greenbelt as as set out by by the County Council in their N Y Two Two document, now that matter clearly has got to be something left to the Inspector and the Greenbelt Inquiry, but I think it's fair to point out that there is actually a difference of view, so it's not an absolute position, that you can't identify more land within within Southern Ryedale, and indeed, erm, not that I want to raise the Local Government Commission's head again, but of course the Local Government Commission is proposing that York be a unitary authority expanded, and once Yor , if York does become a unitary authority expanded then some of these areas will fall within their area, and they may have a different view than er the Ryedale current Ryedale district council does, and therefore I think it is a little unsafe to take just at pure se pure face value, that there is no more land within Southern Ryedale that could be developed.
I think we live with the local authority set up as we have it.
Mr Smith, erm, obviously you want to respond to that, but at the same time could I just press you towards your view and it's really relevant to the districts surrounding York, that we know you can live with the figures of provision as set out by the County Council in the alteration, how ar are you aware of the figures which are being proposed by other participants in the discussion for Greater York?
Yes.
You are?
Could you comment on whether you could live with an expanded requirement, er in South Ryedale?
And if you could, how would you see it being met?
I suspect you've already made that answered that that question.
Ian Smith, Ryedale District.
Erm yea,i I'll come back on that a couple of points, erm regarding Mr Donson erm and the Southern Ryedale and York greenbelt local plan inquiry.
The site that was identified or potentially identified by by the house builders in York was a site which both the County Council and the District Council considered performed a number of greenbelt functions, I think that it would be accepted that in any development plan land should only be allocated if there were some degree of certainty that it would come forward for development within the plan period, the site that was identified, there had been no objections made to the Southern Ryedale local plan so therefore there were no indications that it would have come forward for development within that plan period anyway, had it been identified, had it been allocated.
Erm regarding the question of erm additional sites for housing, I erm if I can turn to erm Barton Willmore's  G One Ten erm in paragraph 
Can I, can I just pause you there?
Have you had a copy of, dare I say it, the tabulation which was produced by the panel, which summarized the various er submissions, and if I just read them to you.
The H B F figure for Greater York was twelve thousand three hundred, the Barton Willmore figure was twelve thousand seven hundred, but they did break it down on a district basis, and they gave five six five o to Ryedale, and then Michael Courcier, represented by Mr Sedgewick, a much more modest figure of ten thousand six hundred, for Greater York.
Ian Smith, Ryedale District.
Erm, as I've said before, I have reservations about whether a much increased figure about above the County Council's er proposal could be accommodated within Ryedale District Council, and I if the figure above that is proposed I would suggest that the extra is accommodated within the new settlement, which I presume the ar argue answer you would have expected from Ryedale, erm Barton Willmore's figure is based on an assumption that they believe that within Ryedale there is a capacity to increase past building rates, I would refute that, erm the building rates in Southern Ryedale I would suggest were abnormally high, because of the development of Clifton Moor airfield, the North Western part of the Southern Ryedale district, sorry South Western part.
The land there is now nearly exhausted, and I would suggest that building rates in future years are in fact likely to decrease from what were abnormally high figures in the in the past ten year period.
Yep, er er yes.
L coming back to your other point I mean your saying you could not physically, or you would not wish to accommodate, let me put it that way, you would not wish to accommodate anything more than is now you're you're making provision for within the South Ryedale local plan
Ian Smith 
can I just just pursue that you said said so the if you embarked on another scenario, and you said that the only way in which extra over, that beyond the figure proposed by the County Council, would be by way of a new settlement, I'm sort of transgressing my own ground rules here, I know that Ryedale has expressed support for the principle of a new settlement, are you saying that you would be looking for a new settlement, possibly in Ryedale?
Ian Smith, Ryedale District.
We would be looking for a new settlement in the best location around Greater York.
I thought you'd say that.
Was that meaning yes or no?
Yes we support the principle, but the question about whether or not it should be in Ryedale district has not been erm answered by our members, and indeed it it we consider it should have wait, I mean this is answering something that'll be discussed at later within this issue, something that should not be er assessed until after the er
Well, let's put it on the shelf for the time being.
But I, we're going to have to discuss when we get to H Two just how you're going through the process of actually finding a site.
If, you know, finding a site for a new settlement is an acceptable way forward, but I, let's leave it on the shelf for now.
Mr Curtis.
Thank you, Chair.
Er David Curtis, York City Council.
I'd just like to comment on two or three issues that were raised earlier.
Clearly we do not wish to go through the same debate that we had at the greenbelt inquiry, erm but it is very relevant erm you'll see from our submissions to the panel that er quite clearly the City Council did not agree entirely with the proposed boundary of the greenbelt, the City Council did take the view that there were certain areas of land proposed to be included in the greenbelt er which did not fulfil a greenbelt function in the Council's view, and that was clearly was discussed at the greenbelt inquiry, it was not just one site, er we clearly were not not in our er responsibility to identify a specific site outside our district, but there were a number of areas er subject to those objections, not just from ourselves, but as Mr erm Donson has said er from various objectors.
The greenbelt boundary as I mentioned earlier as proposed by the County Council is very tightly drawn, excluding the sites which have been mentioned which our allocated, there is no land between the edge of the urban area and the proposed greenbelt boundary and that does seem to us, continues to seem to us er not an appropriate way forward.
In terms of the
I'm sorry David, I thought
In terms of the definition of er what is historic York I think again an issue we went over for some length of time at the greenbelt inquiry, I would draw your attention back to my earlier comments that York is basically a modern industrial city with a very precious historic core, that historic core er represents no more than actually five percent of the built up area, that something like eighty five percent of the city was built after eighteen hundred, the view that was expressed by the County in N Y Two, in terms of the definition of the greenbelt, the Greater York greenbelt and its purposes was not accepted by the City Council, we do not accept that all of the func elements of the York greenbelt contribute towards preserving the character of the historic city, we rely on the the fact that the two comments the Senior Inspector made at this, the the green wedges and historic core itself that establish the historic character of the city, there are many parts of the edge of York which could repli be replicated in many cities, historic or otherwise around the country  and finally just coming back to the issue of scale of development erm the point I should have made earlier about the house builders figures for the city of York is that the house builders did suggest a figure of four thousand for the city, erm, I'm not aware on what basis that was made, but clearly my evidence would quite clearly indicate that I believe that could not be accommodated, certainly on any known sites within the cit current city boundary, thank you Chair.
Mr Sedgewick, can I just ask Mr Sedgewick to .
Sedgewick, Michael Courcier, and partners.
As you know from our submission, sir,n we've taken a more modest requirement for the Greater York area, and that's based to some extent upon what we think is is achievable there, we're not saying that erm the figure should not be higher, we're not saying that the H B F figure for instance should nu not be er put in there, but what we're saying is if that higher figure does go in because of the clear constraints on the provision of additional land the the higher figure may well mean that there's a need for two new settlements ra rather than just one.
The approach we've taken which is set set out in our our submission in section seven, we've we believe that maybe some nine hundred additional sites could be found, this is in addition to the existing allocations, er some nine hundred additional sites could be found within Greater York, by making changes to the boundary of the greenbelt, we you do it the greenbelt is too extensive in some parts, it can be rolled back without affecting the the purpose, erm Mr Donson's already already identified those areas, if that's the case, on our figures a settlement of fourteen hundred plus nine hundred on other sites is is is quite achievable.
In the longer term, if there i is a need for a for addi additional supply that can be be done by increasing the size of the segment or or using some of this additional land.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr Davis.
This is very brief and solely for the record, Chairman, at the York greenbelt local plan inquiry the City Council made one objection, and one objection only, in respect of sites, and that was a site that straddled the York Selby boundary, that was there only expressed concern on sites specific objection, one site in the entire plan.
That's a matter of record.
Thank you.
Well I think, probably ought to make it clear of course that we won't have available to us the greenbelt local plan enquiry, so
Well certainly not in the period during which we're going to be discussing the various submissions, er un un at the E I P, now Mr Heselton, erm in a way your comments yesterday would probably be taken that Selby could cope, or would be prepared to cope, even with additional development, now you better sa tell me whether that's true or false, and I'm thinking particularly of that element of Greater Sel , of Selby which is in Greater York.
Er, yes that's that's true to a degree, Chairman.
Er Terry Heselton, Selby District.
Erm well in in the context of what I did say yesterday it'll come as no great surprise to anyone that like Ryedale we also accept the North Yorkshire County County figures, erm which in short we we find are based on reasonable assumptions and and and an appropriate methodology, compared to some of the more extreme interpretations and projections that have that have been put forward, if I can illustrate that point by reference to er potential building rates, that the highest figure that's been suggested is the one put forward by Mr Grigson, of Barton Willmore, I'm talking for the moment about Greater York generally, and I'll come onto the Selby aspect in a minute.
That's a suggested figure of twelve thousand seven hundred, which imply a building rate of eight hundred and forty six a year, in comparison with the adopted re er rate in the in the adopted plan of six o six and an actual building rate of seven o one, er  my re calculation shows that that would be a thirty nine percent increase, over the adopted plan rate, and a twenty one percent increase over the actual rate.
In comparison the er the the smallest projection put forward by Mr Thomas, would actually result in a twenty one percent decrease in building rates over that approved in the adopted adopted plan, and a thirty two percent increase over the actual rate experienced since nineteen eighty one.
So I don't find either of those those two alternatives acc acceptable largely on the basis of of the arguments put put forward yesterday.
Mhm, yes.
So coming back more specifically to Selby, and taking er Mr Curtis's ball-park figure of of seventeen hundred, erm now already we've we've got approximately eight hundred and fifty committed in terms of a hundred and eighty con er completions, five hundred and sixty permissions including conversions, and a hundred and ten dwellings identified on a site at Elvington in in the Greater York study, and there's really not a great deal more flexibility, erm, because of the greenbelt constraint.
We fully support and endorse the deposit greenbelt boundaries, then I think it's inescapable that at at some point that is going to lead us to leapfrogging over the greenbelt boundary, at some stage during the the the plan period, there may well be sufficient erm commitment and identified sites to to mop up in in the short term, but by the end of of the plan period it's it's my belief that there will be a need to address this issue by bringing forward proposals for a new settlement, er which obviously Selby district er full fully supports.
And you would see that as an inevitable er way forward if you want to meet the housing provision in strategic terms in Greater York.
That's that's right, I mean I I I would suggest that we've arrived at that point now, and we're increasingly likely to do so, because as we've already heard York is very constrained, it's it's it's a relatively small, compact, historic city, the greenbelt boundaries are drawn fairly tightly, correctly in so in in my opinion, and there's really not much room for manoeuvre within with er in a existing settlements within the greenbelt.
Thank you.
Mr Donson.
Er Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation.
I just wanted to take up the point that's been raised again, and it keeps popping its its little head up from time to time, this issue of building rates.
I would say to you that the history of North Yorkshire County is that the house house builders have built, more or less the building rate of planning policy, whatever that has been, and that is a matter of fact, and if and if and if we are in a situation where the market is being fettered, as is the policy, and it's not a policy which we are seeking to go away from specifically, and it is inevitable that the  house builders will build to whatever the policy building rate is, and comparisons of one building rate with another are simply telling you what's happened in the past, not what needs to happen in the future er in terms of meeting the housing requirement, and quite clearly in any area where you are introducing a new settlement, if indeed that's the conclusion we come to, er late later on, erm and I hope we do, but if we are introducing a new settlement you are bound to skew the building rates, and the more and more you reduce the area in which you consider what the building rate effect is the more and more that it actually gets skewed, er and erm you know, quite frankly, when the developers built a new estate at the end of my particular street the building rate went up alarmingly in my area, er and er you know, we can go on forever like that, I just think it's very misleading to just deal with the judgement of building rates.
Mr Thomas.
Thank you.
I had thought that builders built houses when they thought they thought they could sell them, I didn't realize it was part of some altruistic policy of complying with planning policy, still we learn everything every day, don't we?
Erm, sir, I want to address the point, if it's the right time about the level of housing provision the Greater York area in particular, erm that we've seen round the table here that we have special circumstances applying to York, and to its surrounding area.
Erm I won't dwell on York city centre and its historic core because you're all clearly aware of that, but it its setting was accepted at the greenbelt enquiry as being sufficiently important to warrant protection wider than just its physical, existing physical limits, erm the special protection was accorded also to the the special character rather was accorded also to the surrounding countryside, much of which is very attractive, and many of the typical Yorkshire small villages and hamlets that surround the area as well, er and we're clearly in a position in Greater York which is different from the position that arises in many other counties and many other districts within this county, we're in a position of grave shortage of suitable, developable land, we're in a position of high quality er character, and landscape, we're in a position where York, in particular , has extremely good transportation links, to the Leeds Bradford conurbation, where we discuss at length over the last two days there are policies for urban regeneration, subject to regional planning guidance in that area erm and we're in a position where quite clearly York is under pressure, a great deal of pressure from migrants, er because it's a it's an attractive location to live.
When you put all these factors together it concerns me that nobody has been advancing the case that as with other districts, some other districts in York, it would be appropriate, even more appropriate in my view, that the migration assumption should be discounted, there are in my view special reasons why this should be the case, special reasons over and above tho those that have been applied, to the other districts, this in my view would be that the Greater York housing provision for all those reasons I've just highlighted, should be reduced, should be reduced to the seventy five percent level, in other words that would be reducing it by between a thousand and twelve hundred and fifty houses, now I won't get on to the reason that the fact that that's one reason why there's no need for a new settlement, erm but it is a reason in its own right just to protect the character and the capacity requirements and the environmental sensitivities of the Greater York area.
A second factor which I'd like to raise, and please stop me, sir, if I'm not playing your ground rules here, is to get back to the original point made by Mr Davis, as to how this figure is going to be split between the districts, I think it's absolutely essential that this figure is split between the districts, and it may well be, if you decide, sir, to recommend in favour of the new settlement that you may have to leave that as a floating figure to go around the districts, at the moment it is not.
I would like to have more information from the County, or anyone else from the table for that matter, how this figure's going to be split, clearly P P G requires it to be split between district, and I'd like to see it split on that basis.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr Thomas.
Erm I I get the impression from what you're saying is that there is a distinct strategic view which should be taken about York and its role, which in a way would tend to limit the amount of housing development you should be putting in and around York.
Indeed, er and 
And that's the way the authorities should be moving forward with their planning for the county.
I think that is the case, doubly so considering the discussion yesterday where we saw, that whether some of the districts liked it or not there is going to be development in excess of the projected figures in their relevant districts over the plan period.
There is slack elsewhere to effect a redistribution to the benefit of York and its Greater York area.
Probably an el well certainly an element which ought to be considered within the umbrella of the R P G but lets 
Indeed.
wait and see what comes out of that.
Er I'm glad you raised the point about the distribution between the districts, and apart from your comment er I know Mr Davis is opposed to the idea, I haven't discerned a view either way from anyone else, whether they would like them or would not like them.
Well it seems to me, sir, that er the new settlement is becoming a bit of a dustbin which people are throwing their unspent allocations in, and then passing it around from district to district
Mhm.
and Selby are the people who are prepared to take it
I have 
it maybe it maybe, sir, you should allocate all the housing to Selby, and we can all go home.
I'm I'm about to apologize to Mr Grigson, because I see from his submission he actually did distribute it by district within the er Greater York area, er  yea, planning by Selby is not I think the right approach, but.
Mr Cunnane, sorry, Mr Grigson, you want to come in?
Well i I'm happy, I mean I was just going to make that point, sir, but I do have other points, but I'll wait .
Can we have Mr Cunnane, then Mr Sedgewick, and then we will have a coffee break.
Chairman.
Joe Cunnane.
My point is a very short one, I I simply need to put it on the record that it is erm our position that the panel should distribute the er ove York overspill, if I can call it that, as well, that the panel should address the issue of distribution, because our fear is th is th is is is the Selby problem, that Selby are embarked upon a clear strategy of er substantial growth, and we do not want to see er the Greater York overspill being unduly er dir funnelled channelled in that direction.
Thank you.
Mr Sedgewick.
Sedgewick, Michael Courcier and partners.
Our position in in the submission was that if there is not the the need to distribute York's own population around Greater York, then the argument for a separate Greater York figure disappears.
The the original purpose was to to deal with problems arising within the city of York.
If you feel from the discussion around the table that the u requirements of York have not been properly reflected in the the published H One figure er and that there is a need to distribute that population, and therefore there is going to be a Greater York figure.
The overlap with the districts needs to be eradicated, it's a black hole at the moment, every district can pass a its surplus on to another district, and indeed it would be the last district to prepare a district wide local plan that has to meet the residue of the Greater York requirement, it may maybe a good stimulus for the districts to get on with their local plans, but that's not an  planning way.
What we would advocate, as indeed Mr Smith did earlier, is that there should be a a global figure for Greater York, and a reduction, in an appropriate reduction in the requirement for each district, and I believe that anticipating you might ask me what that is what that reduction should be, erm I I can say it must be related to the ca capacity, of that district within Greater York.
That proposition presupposes that if you make a reduction in the district figures, then you must have an idea what the district contribution towards the Greater York figure is, er and I find it difficult to see that you can have, if you have a new settlement, if you have a new settlement the C provision for the new settlement floating in this table, erm but can I just say before we adjourn for coffee, that I really would like to have some very firm answers to the questions which are posed under issue two, er and particularly about two D and that is specific guidance on the location of the new settlement.
Assuming you end up with a new settlement.
Can we break for coffee?
Yes.
Sir announced the the end of debate one, I certainly wasn't under the impression that it had finished.
Well, I've got, if you you just bear with me a moment, I still have one foot dragging in H one, but I thought we'd got to the stage where in order to try and clarify thinking on the matter we ought to progress onto H two, erm, that just let me reveal the thinking, erm that, before I do that can I just say in terms of mechanics those of you who have just joined us for the first time, could you turn your name boards round so I can see them, thank you, and when you want to come in the normal practice is to put your name board on end, so it will attract our attention.
But just let me come back to the the point I want to make, it is it evident to us from what was said yesterday collectively by the District Councils, that they could live with the figure of forty one thousand two hundred, as proposed by the County Council, without a new settlement.
There's a corollary to th that was is our impression, from the various views that were sp s spelt out around the table.
You'll have a chance to come back on whether we have got the wrong impression on that, I mean I recall Mr Heselton's quite clearly, but let me pursue that at a stage further if if we take that as our impression of what you have said collectively, and you are asked to make provision for nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, again collectively in the Greater York area, and I'm addressing this question to the districts, what provision would you make in your districts of your district figure in the Greater York area?
Mr Davis, you want to make a comment?
Well I was I've looked, Peter Davis, North Yorkshire, I've just glanced down the table at certainly at the er my Greater York district colleagues, and er certainly we er are rather surprised that er you have the impression that you have the impression that er erm we could do without the erm the new settlement, quite clearly erm erm certainly Harrogate, Selby, er and Ryedale, and the County Council, believe the the new settlement is absolutely essential, erm and I think that's erm erm certainly a matter of agreement between er us and those three districts, it's absolutely essential.
I think the point, I think the point we're making is that none of the districts yesterday told us that to meet their figure in H one they would need to have a new settlement, for example, I well remember Selby saying to us if we go above our H one figure we would need a new settlement, but they did not say to meet our H one figure we would need a new settlement.
Mr Heselton.
It's in that 
Sorry.
context that we are ask now want to get clarification from the District Councils as to what proportion of there H one figure would be in the Greater York area.
Er may may I reply, please?
Mr Heselton first, yes.
Thank you.
Terry Heselton, Selby District.
Er it yes it it's true to tell, gone on record on several occasions saying in terms of environmental capacity  there's the potential within Selby district to accommodate eleven and a half thousand dwellings, however I did later qualify those comments with reference to the emerging local plan, which is the main vehicle we've we've got for identifying potential development sites and the the qualification was that was that land is not necessarily available in in the right places, to enable us to make a a reasonable distribution for development in accordance with P P G advice, so that the question of a new settlement remains an extremely attractive option for Selby District, and as I mentioned this morning, in terms of whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwelli whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short, in any case, erm
How much are you saying would be in the Greater York area in your district?
Well I haven't suggested a a figure, I made reference  and I also referred to the fact that when you then discounted completions, identified sites, and existing measurements, you would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short.
Short of Mr short of Mr Curtis's figure ?
If if if I be yes, Mr Curtis's ball-park figure.
Mhm, so we'll we'll credit you with minus eight fifty, shall we?
This probably being the best  
Er as as a basic starting point yes.
Yes.
Mr Allanby.
Er David Allanby, Harrogate Borough Council.
Erm first of all Chairman I would confirm that it is our view that with a provision of six thousand five hundred for Harrogate district, we don't think we'd be looking at a new settlement to serve our needs, erm, having said that, we support the Greater York strategy, and we we certainly the level of provision erm for Greater York as proposed by the County Council, er but leaving aside for one moment the issue of a new settlement, it is our view that we'll be able to accommodate the level of growth that I think is anticipated in our district, erm, within the figures, and I'm referring specifically to N Y one, and the table on the last page where there's an indication there of the sort of of er housing numbers that would would have to be accommodated within Harrogate district, and and our part of Greater York is essentially a rural character consisting of a a number of small villages, so there there we have er a total figure of two hundred dwellings to be provided within our part of Greater York, that basically represents erm existing commitments and a a yield from small sites in the future, perhaps conversions, and we'r we're quite happy with that.
I think our view is that if that provision was to be any greater, then we would have significant difficulty in accommodating that provision within our part of Greater York, primarily for for greenbelt considerations, not reasons, erm any additional provision would require a rolling back of the greenbelt, er significant provision would have two implications, erm either it would mean peripheral expansion er of York into the greenbelt around York and into our district, we feel that would adversely affect the special character of York, lead to outward sprawl of the York urban area, encroachment into open countryside, and coalescence of the urban area with the villages in our district, er and we we wouldn't want to support that.
The other option would be expanding the villages themselves, and we find that that would be equally harmful, so we'd be opposed to any significant additional development in our district over and above that that's that's been assumed in that table.
Mhm.
If I if m I summarize that, I know Harrogate have supported the principle of a new settlement within the Greater York figure, but you hadn't anticipated that it would bite on your district, if I can use that word.
We er haven't er certainly been through or down the road of looking at whether there are sites within our district that that could accommodate that, that exercise is still to be done.
But if I put it another way, you could meet your anticipated contribution to the Greater York figure as spelt out in the structure plan?
That's right, sir.
Ninety seven hundred.
Thank you.
Mr Jewitt.
Michael Jewitt, Hambledon District.
Michael Jewitt, Hambledon District Council.
Erm, before we leave item one D, sir, there are two things that Hambledon would like to say both on the q questions that the Chairman asked, capacity, and also on the principal of breaking down the Greater York figure i into the constituent districts, erm, the first point, on capacity, erm, we feel that we have a very limited capacity, er to accommodate development needs advising in Greater York, you'll see from our statement that we have just two settlements an , sorry three settlements in two parishes er within the defined Greater York area, Shipton, Beningborough, and Overton.
Two of these settlements have just ten and eleven dwellings respectively, erm Shipton is the only settlement of any consequence erm being two hundred and er twenty dwellings.
Now, within that overall context it it really would be meaningless to identify a contribution for Hambledon in terms of Greater York, as this erm figures are so are so small.
The second point being that erm if a figure was to be identified for Greater York, we'd feel that this would er unduly interfere with our duties and responsibilities as a District Council to allocate land in our district, cos in effect what it would do is direct us to making a housing allocation in one particular settlement, Shipton, we feel that's our responsibility not the County Council.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Isn't 
Go on, go on.
Isn't there an argument, and perhaps I am st getting now onto two, matter two, that says from Hambledon's point of view, what has just been said is compelling, is a compelling argument in favour of identifying where the new settlement should go, because that will, at the same time, identify where it should not go?
Ah erm well, Chairman, I I think that this is something that's going to cut, as far as Hambledon's got concerns, is going to come up in the erm in the next debate, certainly, erm, the erm, the issue of erm whether policy should be expressed in terms of principle and criteria, or erm area and a district as being a dilemma erm to Hambledon, erm, it feels it's erm erm not being able to support the policy as defined, because ultimately the Council would object to a new settlement in Hambledon.
Erm, and therefore it feels it would be disingenuous of it to support the principle at this stage, it may well lead to a situation where were encouraging the County to go down a particular route, but only to get to the very end of it for us to pull the rug from beneath the County's feet.
Mm.
Yes, erm we are aware of the the view that the District Council have expressed, about the new settlement, that's perfectly clear.
But if I just turn your attention to the figures that are postulated in the County Council's N Y one, the tabulation in paragraph twenty on the last page, it's attributed forty dwellings due in Hambledon, more or less.
My understanding of the situation in Hambledon is that there are, we're talking only small figures I realize, there are twenty commitments currently, within that area, erm clearly there are going to be some unidentified sites come forward erm, I don't wish to er  critical of that figure, I would accept the figure.
Sorry?
I would accept that figure and 
Thank you.
Yes.
Mr Smith, Ryedale.
Chairman.
Ian Smith Ryedale District.
I've already said this morning that the District Council does not consider that it can accommodate any further dwellings within the Southern Ryedale area without adversely affecting the character of the settlements that are already there, or compromising  greenbelt objectives, erm, so therefore to meet the Greater York total, the District Council considers it essential that there is a new settlement to take that amount of housing that cannot be accommodated within the Southern Ryedale area.
What figure can you accommodate in South Ryedale?
Part of.
Sorry, in Rye in the Ryedale part of the Greater York.
If you look at table, at the County Council's M 
Yes.
Y one, erm
Is that the one you can live with?
We could live with that figure, and indeed our local plan is based on on that sort of a figure, being accommodated within that area.
And the York figure we take as three thousand three hundred, Mr Curtis.
Dave Curtis, York City Council.
Yes, sir.
And ou and going back to Mr Heselton, he has said i , I've got a negative factor for him at the moment in terms of minus eight fifty, but let let me let me take the figure which is actually quoted in the County Council's table of nine fifty dwellings.
Is it nine fifty, or is it something slightly higher, or something less?
Er, Terry Heselton, Selby District.
Erm, I believe the figure of nine fifty also includes a an allowance for windfalls windfalls.
Mr Heselton, I understood you said when we started this debate that you were eight hundred and fifty short, or thereabouts, of Mr Curtis's pro-rata figure, which was four thousand two hundred.
Did I misunderstand ?
No, er Mr Curtis's er hypothetical figure 
Yes.
of seventeen hundred.
Mm.
I beg your pardon?
Yes.
Which takes you back to nine fifty.
Sorry, eight fifty.
Eight fifty, more 
Yes.
or less.
Yes.
Hypothetical.
So in progressing through there, and I'm sorry we haven't done it this way, we end up in terms of the County Council figure of nine seven hundred for Greater York, possible er provision from, collectively from the districts of about fourteen hundred, fifteen hundred short.
Is my arithmetic correct?
Yes.
Thank you.
Mr Grantham.
Erm
And then Mr Thompson.
Er I just want wanted to to pick up on your your opening remarks, sir, after coffee, that that the impression you had was that the the the districts, erm, could live with a that the County Council figures.
Erm with without a new settlement erm that that was indeed the the impression that erm I was left with as well, and what what we've sought to do in in the evidence that we've we've put before you is to take the nine seven, nine thousand seven hundred figure in Greater York, and and er s based on the data supplied by the County Council to to demonstrate that that actually when one looks at outstanding commitments erm with planning permission, identified the sites er without planning permission, those those that are allocated in local plans, making suitable allowances for small sites erm windfall sites and conversion, erm the the residual figure that is left in Greater York, which I calculate to be eight thousand six hundred and thirty seven, once one has taken away completions, which I think is an agreed figure between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety three of one thousand and sixty three, that erm, those existing commitments, and the sites likely to come forward,ma virtually match the figure for the outstanding housing requirement, so so one is left with a view that erm from from the data that's put in front of us that there isn't a residue of that size to to accommodate, although I accept that there may well be a residue of some sort, erm and it seems to me that the established Greater York erm framework, er is is the process by which that is distributed around the counties along the lines that the discussion's proceeded this morning.
In that context I think it would be helpful to us erm if we could have submitted to us a version of the table originally submitted by the H B F relating to commitments.
Relating solely to the Greater York area.
If you remember at the end of yesterday, Mr Donson will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong, he fige finished up, we started the day with a total guaranteed minimum of about thirty three and a half thousand, we got that up by arithmetic to thirty four point nine thousand, and I think we finished up at around thirty six thousand at the end of the day.
I think it would be very helpful to the panel to know what proportion of that thirty six thousand is within the district, within the Greater York area, don't ask for that to be done now, because it may well involve some difficult arithmetic, perhaps it's tonight's homework.
Is that possible Mr Donson?
Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation, it's not possible by me, no, but
Right.
I'll I'll leave it to the  
Your sources your sources of supply are on the other side of the room.
Indeed they are, yes.
Thank you.
Mr Thomas.
Yes, thank you, sir.
I think that the districts there possibly given the exception of Selby have taken a rather cautious approach as to what they anticipate being built in their areas within the Greater York area itself er over the next thirteen years.
Er a similar cautious approach which none of them took yesterday when on examination it was found that there was more potential there than before, erm so to help with the figures I have found very helpful erm appendix eight to the er York City Council erm statement, I think it appears in both of their statements   appendix eight Greater York housing provision   sorry, could could I also direct you at the same time to the County Council's N Y five appendix three   now the, the two make interesting comparisons because they both start of with the same H one proposal of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, and I'll remind you there, sir, that only five thousand seven hundred of those are required by the existing population, four thousand of those are for migrants, and the two schedules go of in slightly different directions under the heading of completions, and the reason for that, sir, is that the the Greater York, the er County Council's figures, as you can see were computed in October nineteen ninety two when only seven hundred dwellings had been completed, yet six months later, under item C for the Greater York er housing provision figure, York Ci York City Council figures, the completions were one thousand and sixty three.
Erm, I'll not go through the whole of this table sir, but I do want you to look at the next column, outstanding planning permissions.
In October nineteen ninety two the outstanding planning permissions were three thousand three hundred and fifty, in April nineteen ninety three, there were three thousand four hundred and seventy three.
In fact sir, the County Council's figures produced in another appendix, can't lay my hands on it at the moment, had put this figure in as three thousand six hundred and fifty, but the nub of those two things are, that over that six month period, we're not only seeing more houses built but we have more consented, and that hasn't affected the residue that appears in the rest of these schedules.
Now the County Councils and the City Council's assessment of the capacity of the Greater York study sites are roughly the same, you can see, sir, that as things have moved forward in only a six month period, the City Council calculate there's a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings, only twenty five percent of the migration assumption, none hundred and forty seven dwellings left, compared to the County Council's outdated information which suggested it's one thousand three hundred and thirty five.
Both of those figures, sir, exclude any windfalls whatsoever over the next thirteen years, now if that is a justification for a new settlement, I'm a disbeliever.
It clearly is not the case, that, we have heard from the city this morning, and in the city alone windfalls have been progressing at the rate of eighty per annum, if it was only half that rate over the next thirteen years we would see five hundred more houses, and that excludes windfalls from the rest of the Greater York area, excluding the city of York.
It is quite clear, sir, that on the existing allocations, thirteen years to go, that the figure of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, if you want to stick by that figure, my view it should be lower because it has too much an assumption for migration in a constrained area, if you want to stick by that figure, the nine thousand seven hundred will be reached without a new settlement, of that I have no doubt whatsoever.
Now, a new settlement option is a last ditch option, we're far from being the last ditch here, we're hardly the first ditch.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr Grigson.
Thank you, sir.
Steven Grigson, Barton Willmore.
I will want to come back on the same point that's just been made, but if before I get to that there are some other points that I think I should make in explanation of the lead we have given, if I may call it that, in putting forward the distribution of the Greater York total.
I think it's necessary to to set the scene for that to say that in fact as between the County Council and Barton Willmore there's very little difference in what we see are the requirements for the ring around the city, we both have a figure of of six thousand and something quite small.
The difference between our figures for Greater York and the County Council's figures for Greater York arise almost entirely within York City, and bi I think been established earlier this morning that some overspill, albeit the size maybe in dispute, is necessary from the city into the ring.
Erm I think it's also now pretty much common ground that the capacity of York city is around three thousand three hundred, but I think in in in taking an view on that, and in taking any view o on future windfalls, it is necessary for the panel to keep in mind that historically in the nineteen eighties windfalls were coming through at a time when it was not a adopted local plan for the city of York, so to some extent anything by definition of a substantial size was likely to be a windfall, erm, but also more to the point than that definitional point, I would expect to see, and I think what Mr Curtis has said earlier on that the local plan is likely to tighten up on criteria for release of sites, both small and large, he referred to the shortage of open space, and I would expect to see a policy change in short, a policy climate change, within the city of York that would constrain past historical rates of windfall release.
So that I think the situation affecting the Greater York area is that there wis there is a requirement to accommodate within the ring part of the needs of the city, and on our best estimate that er I apologize for the word overspill, but it it is descriptive, is of the order of three thousand three hundred dwellings to be accommodated in the ring which after the needs of York.
I don't intend to discuss the  housing, whether seven hundred acres, sorry seven l land for seven hundred houses is owned by the City of York, that's not part of our case one way or the other, but we have offered you a distribution of the Greater York provision figure between the districts, because from Barton Willmore's very extensive experience of participation in local plan work up and down the country, I think we share the view that er City of York have, that Ryedale have, my colleagues to the left and right on this side of the table have, that there does need to be a distribution, otherwise there will be at best confusion as to whether local plans comply with the structure plan, and at worst a game of of pass the parcel and everybody will be conforming, but nobody will actually be possibly meeting the figures, and that is the situation that I don't think anybody would wish to see as a result of er the outcome of of alteration number three, I mean I don't know how the County Council would would really be able to to say whether they thought a local plan conformed to the structure plan, without knowing what that distribution was, perhaps in some bottom draw manner which is not now the approved way of going about these things, so that I think there does need to be a distribution for the proper planning of York, and before coming on to our to explain our figures a little bit, I should also say, perhaps in in response to remarks Mr Thomas made earlier on about the general character of the York area and the need to to protect that, that that course is precisely what the greenbelt is for, and what it does, it isn't necessary to extend that concept across the whole of the vale of York, and therefore to seek to er discount migration outside the greenbelt.
That is what the greenbelt is actually there for, and if you have it there for that purpose, as I said yesterday, the necessary corollary is that you have additional provision beyond it, and  I can't resist to offer Mr Wincup some support, I'm sure one piece of evidence that he gave you about the letter from the Parish Council, he's probably already replied to that Parish Council saying, as you're in the York greenbelt have no fear, all the Selby needs will pass straight across your heads and land somewhere else.
The erm point about are distribution within Greater York is that we have attempted to look at this in what I think is a a rational and realistic manner, we have looked, and you'll see this from our supplementary paper, I apologize for its lateness, but I think it's benefited from the additional thought that could be given to it, we have looked both backwards, at the present day, and forwards, we've looked backwards at past build rates, we've looked at the present day position in the sense of the population shares within Greater York, and we've looked forwards in terms of the commitment figures that are given in the N Y one paper that we've just been looking at, and taking all those things into account, and adding in what we see as the right location for a new settlement, namely Selby district, we come to the figures that are in our supplementary paper, and there is clearly a great deal of common ground between the evidence you get from looking either at past building rates or population shares, as now, or future commitments which all point towards a broadly similar distribution, we say, with the addition of a new feature namely the new settlement, so that I commend those figures to you as somebody who's actually dared to put their toe, or maybe their whole body into the water, and given you not only some numbers, but also a basis by which if you should er have a different Greater York figure in mind, a basis on which that could be rationally er approached, I would not certainly defend to the last ditch the need to put a figure of fifty dwellings into the structure plan for the Hambledon part of Greater York, there may be a cut off point beyond which you don't go, but certainly for Ryedale and Selby, with very substantial numbers there is a need to indicate what the appropriate division should be, and you could not for instance indicate what the er Ryedale non Greater York figure was, without someone telling us the, as the Chairman rightly said, having an idea of what the Ryedale Greater York figure should be, so it isn't really I think feasible to have district figures for non Greater York, and one Greater York figure, that doesn't er get away from the issue, and nor does it solve the potential for confusion.
My final point, is that, and we have had it raised this morning, erm from er I think it was consultants on behalf of the C P R E that there was sufficient capacity within Greater York, and they referred to a table in their  and their submission.
I had a close look at that table, obviously a matter of some interest and that's the reason I return to this, as I read the table, there is a very substantial amount of double counting within it, for this reason, that all outstanding er planning permissions are included once, and there are then separate categories of allowance for all types of sites, namely large windfalls, conversions, small sites, and allocated sites, those are all put in, er or most of them are put in at thirteen years worth, that being the remainder of the plan period to two thousand and six, it will not have escaped you that if you include thirteen years worth all the existing commissions are part of that thirteen years, and so  simplest approach to correct that table would simply to discount the outstanding commitments, because they're all counted again as part of the thirteen years, I do have a secondary point that the allowance for conversions is very much higher than what seems to be happening, and in what is in the tables that er Mr Thomas drew it to your attention from the York City er appendix eight, so that er on on two counts, but mainly the double counting one there is a great deal of er erm optimism, if I can call it that, in that table.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr Curtis.
Thank you Chair.
David Curtis, York City Council.
Er I merely want to comment on the erm apparent misunderstanding on my comments on windfalls earlier on, erm it has been suggested that we we're tightening down on windfalls, was the quote actually used, erm, there is no intention in the local plan to er ignore the er windfalls, to actually deal with them in a different way than had happened in the past, clearly if sites come forward which are windfalls which are suitable in environmental terms then the City Council will give, as P B G one requires, the appropriate consideration to those applications, what I was merely saying this morning was the the likelihood of such windfalls coming forward, and the scale was clearly going to be substantially less than had occurred in the past, and the the figure of eighty a eighty a year, which was for a five year period, which was quoted to me, erm clearly would not be representative of my expectation of the future.
Thank you.
Er Mr Spittle.
Malcolm Spittle, County Council.
Erm I was going to pick up on a number of points that have been raised by previous speakers, but erm Mr Grigson and Mr Curtis seem to have er dealt with a few of those, erm just with regard to the the table put in by C P R E, with their figures, I would just agree with Mr Cur er Mr Grigson that there is a very substantial degree of double counting in those figures, there is also a very substantial degree of over provision in the allowance for for conversions, er past conversion rates in Greater York have averaged something like twenty nine dwellings per year, over a fifteen year period your talking about four hundred and thirty five dwellings, which is the figure that both York City Council and ourselves have have made allowance for for conversions, that compares with a figure of a thousand dwellings referred to by the C P R E and I see no foundation for that figure, erm, as I say Mr Curtis already picked up on the point about windfalls rates by Mr Thomas, erm just turning to the difference between the tables er submitted by the County Council and York City Council on the the residue within the er Greater York area, I would accept the figure, the figures put in the tables by Mr er by Mr Curtis, I think that they have picked up the the more recent planning permissions and the completions information, and they also take on board there more recent work on erm development within the city, and I I accept that table.
Thank you.
Mr Smith.
Ian Smith, Ryedale District.
I'd like to comment on Mr Grigson's table, in particular the figure proposed for Ryedale, er his figure is based on the assumption that because Selby gets the new settlement it therefore gets a corresponding reduction in house building elsewhere in the Greater York portion of Selby.
The development strategy adopted in the Greater York study never envisaged that the settlement, or the district that got the new settlement would therefore get a corresponding reduction in the amount of land it had to provide to meet the needs of the Greater York area, the strategy we use to identify sites within the Greater York area that could be developed without compromising greenbelt objectives, and that the new settlement would be added on outside that area without a reduction in that that figure.
Mhm.
Mr Cunnane.
Er Joe Cunnane,Sa representing Sam Smith's Brewery Tadcaster.
Just like to make a comment on Mr Grigson's submission erm points on erm the Greater York figure.
First of all I should point out that the Nor the County Council er figure of none thousand seven hundred is actually a figure for local needs plus one hundred percent migration, and if you follow Mr Thomas's figures that leaves a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings without any windfalls over the next thirteen years, which is quite inconceivable, so in order to establish his point on the need for the new settlement on tha on on his figures, the Bar Mr Grigson of Barton Willmore has to up the figure for Greater York to twelve thousand seven hundred, as set out in his erm paper.
The s the point I would make is that first of all I don't accept that twelve thousand seven hundred is er a tenable figure but that, probably the more important point is that there has to be a policy response, and a policy response to this issue demands that there is at least some response to the mi to the level of migration er you know my my my view has been put forward very clearly about that, but I would simply make make the point for the record that even accepting one hundred percent migration, there is no statistical case for a new settlement.
Thank you.
Mr Sedgewick.
Sedgewick, Michael Courcier and Partners.
The may maybe I just comment on that that last that last point, which as I understand it it the the justification for a new settlement is brought about solely by increasing the requirement for Greater York to twelve thousand seven hundred, going through those figures there seems to me, for instance, for both Ryedale and Selby to be more provision than could be met in a single settlement, I I think the the figures put forward by Barton Willmore are more than can be met in existing allocations and a single new settlement of a reasonable size.
So I I think the new settlement remains justified even with the significantly lower figure for Greater York.
Mhm.
Thank you.
I noted the point, erm I think to some extent we probably can now move forward to H two, in in a proper sense, but I'll ask Mr Davis er A if he wishes to give some reaction to the last few comments er and then your lead in to H two.
Mr Grigson said he really .
I assume Mr Grigson, as he hasn't raised his board has said all he wants to say at this stage on the points that have been made.
In relation to factor .
Do you want anything else on matter one, Mr Grigson.
Mr Grigson, for Barton Willmore.
I don't feel any need to respond on on Ryedale o or to Michael Courcier.
There was one little bit of leftover, as you've given me an opportunity before I depart, and that was that erm we did discuss earlier today, under this heading the possibilities of erm their being sites on the inner edge or between the built up area, or there might become sites between the built up area and the inner edge of the greenbelt, I think the implication was they may be in Ryedale.
My understanding is that A those don't exist at present within the deposit plan, but if they did at some future date, for any reason, that their function would be to be used after two thousand and six to sustain the permanence of the greenbelt.
Thank you very much.
Mr Davis.
Yes.
I think just two points.
Er erm we think the nine thousand seven hundred dwellings based on one hundred percent migration for the Greater York area is the appropriate strategic approach erm for the Greater York area, the County Council does not see the need for any policy intervention in terms of migration, in respect of Greater York in the way it feels is necessary in respect of er of four other districts.
Erm on a general point about the ability to find extra land, erm in and around the urban area erm of York, particularly erm on the inner edge er of the greenbelt.
Having been through the six months of the greenbelt local plan enquiry, I can say quite clearly to this er examination in public, that I doubt whether there is the land available erm er around the inner edge erm erm to increase the level of of housing development in and around the city without seriously prejudicing greenbelt objectives.
Thank you.
Now, before you make your opening statement in the context of H two we have some extra papers to distribute.
Er, Mr Donson leaving us?
Yes.
Mr Grigson leaving us.
They both are .
It would be appropriate to say something 
Yes.

Is Donson coming back?
Is Grigson coming back?

Just a minute.
Mr Grigson, are you retiring altogether from the fray?
Yes I am, yes, sir.

Are you ready to go  tell me tell me when.
Alright okay.
.
No.
Alright.
Thanks.
So can we now move in the formal sense to looking at the next issue for discussion, which covers policy H two, the Greater York new settlement, and the first part of the issue which we shall address is, does the proposed Greater York new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response to the assessed development land requirements of the Greater York area, and I'll ask Mr Davis to make his introductory statement.
Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council.
Thank you Chairman.
I'll go straight into er item two A I think the first thing the County Council would would wish to say this erm examination is that er today we are really seeing the culmination of I suspect er ten year work erm in Greater York by the Greater York authority and a particularly intensive period of work over the last five years, er by the Greater York authorities, the paper that I put round N Y five the matter two A really addresses the history and why we reached the conclusions corporately that we have and as all as we've already indicated erm progress was able to be made when the Secretary of State included a Greater York er dimension erm into the er into the structure plan in a the first alteration, erm and that enabled a body of work to be undertaken by the Greater York authority, and I think I ought to say at this point that the Greater York authority comprises of the County Council er and five District Councils, and there you have six different councils, all with an interest in the future of Greater York, sitting down together, trying to sort out the way in which the future of Greater York erm ought ought to be developed, and the means they did it did that of course was through the Greater York study, which began in nineteen eighty eight and started off immediately with a study of forty, fifty development, potential development sites, erm in and around er er Greater York which produced a report, as I said in on page three of the of N Y five, around about April nineteen eighty nine, the conclusions of which were quite clearly unacceptable to erm members of the Greater York authority, because they saw quite clearly, and they were supported by the public in this, that to continue peripheral development, which had been the pattern of development in the Greater York area, erm certainly through the sixties and seventies er was unacceptable in terms of its impact on settlements, and particularly er its impact erm on erm erm the York greenbelt which still at that stage erm had yet to be made statutory, and that was again one of the main stimuli to making progress, the need to s formally define er the York greenbelt.
The Greater York authorities therefore looked for a widening of the options available, er, in Greater York, and those that have seen the Greater York study, and it is a document that we've put in to the examination will see that there was a fundamental full scale wide ranging er assessment er of all the options er open er within the er Greater York er area and they are er set out erm in pages three er and four of N Y five.
The public consultation exercise that was part of that erm Greater York study, and quite clearly the Greater York study was not a statutory plan, it was an informal plan, but it was the only way really that progress could be made in the absence erm of adopted local plans in Greater York, it was essential that that document was pursued to give a framework for the preparation of district local plans er and the greenbelt local plan, and the resolution that followed the consultation and the long body of work, and I'll read it out, was that the development strategy for Greater York from ninety six to two thousand and six should be based on agreed sites within and on the periphery of the built up area, and that the residual requirement be met for the development of a new settlement or settlements located beyond the outer boundary erm of the greenbelt, a quite clearly there's a major policy implication there that a new settlement was not acceptable within the greenbelt but would have to be er outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt, and the public consultation on that er study er attracted widespread support for a new settlement strategy in Greater York, all six authorities agreed that that was the direction er that had to be taken, it also had another benefit in that it enabled work on the York greenbelt local plan erm to proceed and that has now been taken forward to the stage where the enquiry terminated in May, it's a joint enquiry in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, with a Southern Ryedale local plan enquiry in April ninety three, and we would hope that the inspectors report on that six month enquiry, when he considered all the objections to the er greenbelt proposals of the County Council, largely supported by the er District Council will be available er in the near future.
The County Council also accepted as part of this oral approach that there was a need for an alteration to the structure plan, because the approved structure plan did not make provision for a new settlement as an element of approved North Yorkshire strategic policy, and we've progressed that erm alteration through to the examination er in public er today.
So the current position is that there's been substantial progress er in Greater York, and I think its testimony to the willingness of the Greater York authorities to work together there that there's been such a level of agreement I think probably er never before achieved in the Greater York area as to the direction that Greater York erm er should take.
We think that on balance we have er the majority of the support of the public at large within Greater York, that this is the strategic er approach that is necessary for Greater York, it's necessary to protect the greenbelt and it's necessary to protect communities and villages er in and around erm Greater York.
Could I also say one thing finally, and that is the fact that we've tried to run together the alteration and the greenbelt local plan as concurrently er as possible, er it would appear that the timing erm is coming together reasonably satisfactorily erm in that we hope that the report from the greenbelt local plan enquiry, is not to er far distant, erm and we would expect, sir, that you will be reporting on the proceedings at this examination in public er in the not to distant future, well I think I did give an undertaking at the greenbelt local plan enquiry that the County Council, because the two are er interrelated to a degree, that I would expect the County Council would not wish to pursue either report er until er the other er is available, and that seems to the County Council to be entirely sensible, that the two reports, the structure plan alteration and the greenbelt local plan enquiry, erm should be looked at together.
There we are, sir, that's erm er er a very brief history erm of erm er of the new settlement strategy, erm it's one clear that the County Council thinks is the appropriate way erm er for the Greater York area er to proceed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I noted, and we've already had the flavour of it, in to some respect today, that initially you had almost unanimity of support from the District Councils er York City have changed their view erm and equally Hambledon are very luke warm, if I put it no more than that, er on the idea of a new settlement in the sense that they probably support the principle of the new settlement, but not in Hambledon.
But could you comment, and no doubt Mr Curtis will also want to amplify why York er seem to have cooled on the idea.
There is a there is reference in your paper to that.
Yes.
Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council.
I mean York City Council will obviously er Mr Curtis will obviously give his views on the situation, erm the particular issue that seems to have changed the mind of York City Council is the reference in P P G thirteen, transport to sizes of new settlement not being erm er desirable in in in transport terms, small scale resettlements.
Now there is no definition of what's small erm erm is erm in er P P G er thirteen and perhaps Mr Curtis could help us in due course erm on an assumption that the new settlement was somewhat larger that th what the County Council is proposing, whether that would erm change the view of York City Council, I I think there is another factor again I could be corrected on this by Mr Curtis and this tended to come out in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, er and that York City Council seem progressively to place more importance on peripheral development than on the new settlement strategy
Mhm.
erm that is my general feeling for erm erm erm the position, York's emerging views erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry erm weren't shared by the districts er which surround the city, or by the County Council.
Strictly on P P G two terms er because of the effect er on the greenbelt, but I wouldn't want to go any further than that, that's my impression, Mr Curtis will undoubtably correct me if I'm wrong.
Yes, I mean I noticed from the draft P P G thirteen that they do not define small.
How small is small?
Mr Curtis, do you want to
Yes, thank you, Chair.
come back on that?
David Curtis, York City Council.
Erm, clearly their is a a long history of cooperation between the authorities on Greater York, and er I think it is important to explain the development of thinking on that, and the reasons why the City Council has, I would say progressively, er reduced its er the warmth of its enthusiasm to such a state that it's actually become extremely cold now.
The original dispersed development strategy ended up with a shortfall, something like two thousand dwellings, compared to the sites which had been agreed between the various authorities at the time, it's also worth noting that that was based on a dwelling target of nine thousand one hundred for Greater York, I think that's correct, over the period since actual sites which have been agreed between the authorities since then have clearly increased, so as you've seen in my appendix eight the residual requirement has now been reduced to a a level of nine hundred and forty seven.
The eighty nine strategy was actually supported by four of the authorities including the County Council, but clearly, and I fully appreciate why that decision was made two districts particularly, Ryedale and Selby, felt unable to support the strategy.
The City Council, faced with the view that er there was two thousand shortfall in dwellings, that clearly two of our most important neighbours in terms of their land area were unhappy with that proposal, agreed to er proceed to pursue the issue of the new settlement.
In that interim period of that work the draft P P G three came out, and made it quite clear that the new settlement would have to lie without beyond the outer edge of the greenbelt, and that was a fur a further consideration.
Since that time clearly we've also had a series of further er indications development government guidance on the issue, new P P G one, three, and twelve all produced in March ninety two, which made it quite clear the environmental considerations were to be given greater attention in development plans.
P P G three, the revised P P G three when it came out clearly, in my opinion changes the emphasis from the draft P P G three from the draft P P G three, paragraphs thirty two and thirty three which I would emphasize should to be read together, clearly indicates that new settlements are as someone said this morning, sorry, earlier in the discussion today, an issue of last resort.
This has further emphasized to ourselves with, I accept our reading of the draft of P P G thirteen, and also more work we've been doing on land in the city, and on the potential traffic implications in particular of further growth outside the ring road.
All of those factors lead the City Council to the view that the current level of residual given emerging government advice, the City Council could no longer support the idea of a new settlement of something like fourteen hundred dwellings set in the countryside beyond the outer edge of the York greenbelt.
It's interesting to note that actually now we've since made that decision the residual has as I've said come down to nine four seven, so if we do have a new settlement of fourteen hundred we're already ending up with a a higher level of proposed development for Greater York now, the nine seven would obviously be exceeded if we had a fourteen hundred new settlement within Greater York.
The further out from York the new settlement goes the less self contained it will be, the more the tendency will be for travel into the city, which is the main service centre to be car based.
The belief of the City Council is that, notwithstanding there are clearly difficult traffic problems in the city, there is more opportunity to encourage people to use other more environmentally friendly modes of travel by locating development in and on the edge of the main urban area, a view that's supported by P P G thirteen and the research document onto planning, transport and planning emis planning and transport emissions on which it was based.
It's for those reasons, sir, that the City Council feels that it can no longer support the proposed proposals for new settlement, just to come to your question about the issue of scale, I am not able to define what er small is in P P G three, it's obviously been left deliberately vague, but I would draw your attention to the Ucwetec T P A study I've just referred to which makes it quite clear in their terms that to be self contained in transport terms the nearest any settlement ne really needs to be in excess of twenty thousand people.
Now I could not countenance, and I'm sure none of the authorities around us could countenance a new settlement that scale in Greater York.
If you compare a fourteen hundred new settlement, three thousand people with the new settlements around York, as you've seen in our papers, and some of the papers circulating, it's very similar in size to many of the expanded villages around York, which are all, virtually without exception, commuter settlements for the urban area, so the inevitable consequence of that size of new settlement, in my opinion, be it fourteen hundred, be it two thousand five hundred dwellings, it will be primarily a large housing estate set in the open countryside.
On that basis the City Council is doesn't feel able to support to support that proposal.
Thank you.
Can we have the County Council's response to that?
Mr Davis, do you want to make any comment on that?
Er yes I do, erm 
Before I return to other people.
I really don't want to hog the debate because I know there are other 
No it's alright, alright .
But certainly one, three things I'd like to respond to erm erm mm Mr Curtis.
First of all erm he justified his view on environmental considerations as as considered by the City Council, I think we would say, the County Council, that one of the main considerations that has brought us to the conclusion that we have are environmental considerations, the environment of York and its immeding immediate surroundings, the protection er of the York greenbelt, environmental considerations have been er at the most er in our minds.
But if I may interrupt, how do you cope with the argument that Mr Curtis was making that if your settlement is, say, less than two and a half thousand it is no more than a large housing estate which relies on the centre of York for its functions, of service, shopping, entertainment, and therefore that the difference between that the difference between a new settlement beyond the greenbelt and peripheral development, in those terms, is no different.
Well Mr Curtis of course is erm is what I would describe as using inflammatory descriptions to try and do down what's going to happen with a a new settlement, erm he seems to be convinced that what we're going to end up with er in Greater York is a development of the sort of er er character that he has described, it would be the clear intention of the local authorities to ensure that an appropriate self contained community erm er is developed, now erm there is no re 
Is that really feasible at that level?
Can, sorry, can I I don't want to stray into item matter B .
Mm, mm.
if we can at this stage 
I just want to get the concept of 
Yes, yes.
of the thing clear.
Is it really feasible that at the sort of level that's being talked about, be it your level or the level being put forward by some of the objectors to the structure plan, the new settlement could actually hope to provide a good level of comparison shopping, for example?
Well can we make it absolutely clear that no settlement, anywhere, er in North Yorkshire, or in York and Humberside probably is self contained.
If you want to en try and ensure that you're going to have a self sustained community, one hundred percent, you make sure that presumably you've got a show case cinema with fifteen screens there, er a B and Q, erm a whole range of of facilities that nobody ever needs leave, erm erm erm er that new settlement, the reality of the real world of course is that all settlements to a greater or lesser degree, er have a relationship with other er larger scale settlements, now then let's look at the new settlement, fourteen hundred dwellings, we estimate that that is going to be of the order of around three thousand three hundred people, now that is sizeable, it is not small, it is larger than a number of the small market towns er in North Yorkshire, like Boroughbridge, Settle, it is a significant development erm erm and within it erm there will be a requirement er be a requirement for a a a primary school, it justifies that.
Certainly we cannot provide a fully one hundred percent sustainable community, you'd be talking about some vast city to move towards that, erm the re the real world is that the the hierarchy of settlements, erm all settlements, have greater or lesser degree of facilities depending on their size, and there'll be no difference er to the new settlement, and I think to to run an argument on the basis of Mr Curtis er has run it is unfair to the concept of the new settlement.
Thank you Mr Davis, I, I 
Well there were two other points Chairman.
Yes go on.
Erm, the the reference of last resort was Mr Thomas's reference erm it it is not a reference which I think you find anywhere er in government guidance, and I think what P P G thre three says is the opportunity to to pursue them will be relatively rare, we think this is a relatively rare circumstance, er in North Yorkshire, it's unique, er and it's entirely driven er by justifiable er reasons to protect the the wider environment of Greater York.
The third thing, and I gu would have to say it's a bit of a red herring thrown out by Mr Curtis is the issue of traffic growth con concern on traffic growth.
Could I say to you that in terms of Greater York the County Council is the highway authority, the County Surveyor advises the County Council on traffic implications as a concept, the County Councillors highway authority is satisfied with the merits er of a new settlement.
I won't go any further, because I know there are other flags up rou round the room, Chairman.
Ca can I say, I'm attempting to stick with two A er, I think I'll take Mr Grantham, and then we'll adjourn for lunch.
But would you gentlemen who have flagged that you want to speak leave those flags up?
Alright?
Mr Grantham.
Er, er, John Grantham, C P R E.
Er, sir, at the risk of straying slightly into into two B, you, do forgive me in advance, but you raised the specific point about size, and and erm there was er one or two statements that there isn't a a clear view on size in P P G three, I think it's important to to bear in mind the interrelationship between all P P G s and as Mr Curtis said, the research that that backs them up, and I I I point you to three quotes in the statement that C P R E have put in, erm i i i paragraph four point one seven,an and s the quote that attaches to that is taken from the research that erm er backs up draft revised P P G thirteen, transport, and erm I shall quote from that on this question of size,i it is also evident that smaller settlements, those with populations of less than fifty thousand, but particularly very small settlements are characteristically less transport emissions efficient than larger settlements, I think the the erm essence of of that particular piece of research is not as Mr Davis was implying to achieve totally self contained settlements, I don't believe such a concept exists, it's actually erm a planning land use in the long term to reduce C O two emi emissions something that is essential now to government policy, I think perhaps more instructive though is is the quote that I've in included in paragraph four point one nine and that's taken from er er this book here which I perhaps should submit the whole chapter in evidence to to the panel, I've only just included one quote, it's it's I suggest one of the more interesting reads that you may have as a result of this panel, it's by Colin Ward, and it's called New Town, Home Town, it's undertaken by er, sorry includes some of the work that's been undertaken by the University of Reading, erm and er David Lock Associates, on erm er new town research, and this this is due to be published by H M S O shortly, it's unfortunate that it wasn't available in time for this E I P, but I think erm, if you'll bear with me, I will read out the quote that I put in four point one nine, because I feel that it is useful on this question of of size, we concluded that if you are interested in environmental impact, energy conser consumption, and sustainability, new settlements have to reach a certain size to be worthwhile, it's parallel to the old arguments that used to take place around self containment in new towns, we found that new settlements of much less than five thousand houses, that's about fourteen thousand people are not really worthwhile because if they are smaller than that you are simply putting a housing estate in the countryside, a phrase that that has already been put round this morning, it appears that the best minimum for a new settlement, the best minimum, is about ten thousand houses, that's that's twenty five thousand people, which as it happens is about the size of the original garden cities.
Starting from the logic of sustainability, we end up with a very similar size for a new community to the one that Howard was writing about a hundred years ago.
I erm think that that is quite useful research that has been undertaken for government, and it it has been carried through, er as I'm sure everybody is aware, into the U K strategy for sustainable development, the consultation period of which is just concluding, erm I won't take you any more of the panel's time to read that quote as it's written in my in my statement.
Yes, I I we have read it, we have read it.
Er obviously, I mean the new towns movement as conceived immediately after the war was geared to meeting London housing needs, you know, we're not comparing like with like, but I think, I take the point that you are making in terms of er sustainability.
Mr Spittle  
Mr Spittle.
to say something.
Malcolm Spittle, County Councillor.
I was very interested to read this quote from David Lock, erm of David Lock associates, and I just wonder how it squares from the fact that er Mr Lock associates submitted an objection to H two on the grounds they wanted a settlement of eighteen hundred dwellings to the North of York.
Erm, it does seem to be something of a contradiction in terms there, and in fact Mr Lock isn't here today because his clients have subsequently withdrawn from the er E I P but er it would have been interesting to have asked him the question.
On that note, I think you should you should go and refresh yourselves.
Can we, can we reconvene at two o'clock, please.

Ah there we are,.
Right  abdominal wound, she's a wee bit  confused.
She didn't bother to tell me that she'd only got  to call you, right?
Erm she wasn't in her nightdress but she only dressed herself, she said  
And you  
She said she went to buy something  herself, she phoned the clinic and the clinic .
She's  here and  says she should be  fortnightly .
So I don't know whether you want to go and see her rather than, I could get a doctor to go and see her and phone,.
it's just that I'm never gonna get to up to.
?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
erm, first  twelve weeks pregnant so should I mark at the bottom when she types .
Erm  this one.

Right Mr Gordon I think the room is now as full as it can get so we'll kick off today's proceedings er could you start by introducing your team for the record.
Yes of course it will be a pleasure.
I'm Jack Gordon, I'm Director General of aircraft one with the Ministry of Defence.
I'm the Project Manager for the United Kingdom er for the Eurofighter two thousand project at the international level I also chair the N E F M O board of directors.
On my left is Mr William Perry  who's the Director of Finance and Secretariat, air one in the procurement executive.
On my right is Mr er Nick Evans who's the Head of Resources and Programmes Air and on my extreme right Group Captain Granville White who's Deputy Director, Operational Requirements air four.
Right thank you very much Mr Gordon.
Er can I just say at the outset that some of the material we'll be covering this morning may well be classified.
Yes.
Er when you feel that you can't answer our questions in open session, if you could indicate that then we will go into closed session at the end of the morning and cover that ground in that way.
Understood.
Looking first of all then at the operational performance of the aircraft, you have told us already in written answers that in the light of the changed security situation you have relaxed the Eurofighter requirement.
Can you tell us an indication of how much the changes reduce operational capability in percentage terms?
Erm well perhaps before I answer that question Mr Chairman, I could just briefly skim across the programme and bring you up to date as to where we are and then we'll go directly on to that point.
Very briefly  would .
Yes, very brief .
Er well the committee will recall that shortly after  it published its report in Spring ninety two, the new German Minister of Defence  questioned whether the project was still required at that degree of sophistication.
For our part we had no doubt about the continuing need for an aircraft of Eurofighter two thousand's broad capabilities.
This view was subsequently confirmed  by a thorough review of the operation requirement which was carried out under the direction of the four chiefs of defence staff.
The review of the requirement and the options for meeting it er culminated in an agreement between the four ministers of defence in December ninety two to re-orientate er the project.
We provided a note to the committee in January ninety three about this.
Well, re-orientation of the project has involved a line by line review of the European staff requirement, the E S R D  to see whether it might be relaxed in the light of the changed international security situation.
It also involves rescheduling the whole programme so that decisions on commitments to production can be deferred until nineteen ninety five, with first deliveries to United Kingdom and Italy occurring in the year two thousand and to er Spain and Germany in two thousand and two.
Work by the staffs in the four ministries of defence and by the NATO agency N A F M A to re-orientate the project in line with the minister's directions is now at an advance stage.
The revised European staff requirement document has been signed now by the four chiefs of air staff, this was done last month.
A revised schedule for the development programme  has now been agreed with industry and this will be taken into the contract.
The four governments are also resolved to cap their financial liabilities for this programme.
So negotiations are in progress on revised prices for the development phase.
These have taken somewhat longer than we anticipated but we are at last making good progress towards agreeing prices for the Eurojet contract and we are expecting to receive more acceptable price quotations from Eurofighter very shortly for their part of the work.
The changes to the programme also require a new memorandum understanding with our partners.
The draft for this is almost complete  but it can't be finalised until the costs of the revised programme have been agreed for each of the participating nations.
All being well this new M O U will be ready for submission to ministers by the middle of this year.
Turning now to the development work itself  in general, the development work is going well.
There have been no fundamental technical problems.
There has been a very considerable delay to the first flight but this is now scheduled for April this year.
The delay has been due mainly to the need to be absolutely certain about the integrity of the flight control system software before the aircraft takes to the air.
While  the delay to the start of the flying programme has been much longer than anyone would wish, much more progress has been made in the ground and rig testing than at the comparable stage of any previous project I have been associated with  and we are very satisfied indeed with the results that have been obtained so far.
There is  assessment in the wind tunnels, for example, is complete and the results are good.
The structural test programme  is also making extremely good progress and the results from the engine test programme are ex very encouraging indeed.
The performance of the engine, on the bench, already meets its full specification for thrust and fuel efficiency and even it exceeds it slightly in some respects.
So overall we remain very confident that the Eurofighter two thousand will meet the full operational requirement.
So now turning to the point which er I think you asked us to address.
Can we quantify, or explain, the areas in which we have made some relaxation and I'll ask Group Captain Granville White to answer that.
Well the specific question I asked is whether you've quantified in percentage terms  erm perhaps Group Captain  you could give us an indication of how it has affected it?
Yes certainly, yes.
The point about er relaxations and what impact it would have on its combat capability.
I think the important point I'd like to make at the outset is that when the review of the requirement was carried out it was carried out both nationally and on a four nation basis, the ministers, once that was complete, the ministers decided that and stated publicly in December ninety two, that  we will continue with the existing airframe and engine combination and that each nation er based on a family of aircraft concept could decide from a menu which equipments it would fit according to their individual requirements and their budget and  we looked individually at each of the items to see what impact it would have on the operational capability if we were to remove them and what erm was decided in the end and the requirement reflects this, was signed last month by the Chief Surveyor's staff, is that some nations have decided to remove certain items of equipment but for the U K we felt that it was necessary to keep all the major items and therefore as far as the U K is  erm impact on the operational requirement is concerned, there is no significant alteration in its operational capability and therefore in overall percentage terms there is no  decrease in the capability at all.
Now individual nations who've decided  to do without a particular item of equipment, clearly that will be developed into the aircraft and therefore they have the option to  if they wish to d decide  later on to fit it in.
Thank you.
I'll  I think at least four particular areas where the United Kingdom has decided not to, as it were, take the full specification.
Er, can we have a look at those or or at least, has accepted specific changes to those specifications.
Can we have a look at  those four and if you could, I'd be grateful if you can tell me what change in the security situation, as envisaged by the government, has led to our acceptance of those changes.
Now the first one, which was mentioned by the minister in the R A F debate, er is the reduced requirement to operate on damaged runways.
What change of perception in the security situation has led to our accepting that diminution of capability.
Yes the there are two aspects really to that, one is the length of runway operating  er and the other is the surface, erm, if I could take the first one.
When the requirement was originally written erm and agreed in nineteen eighty seven  all of the nations decided that erm we required a short take off and landing capability and that was based on the  sort of the then cold war situation where the prospects of  runways and airfields being very severely damaged in a sort of central European type of scenario, and therefore the possibility that there might be only very small operating strips available from those runways and that was the basis for the particular length that was decided at the time.
Because of the changed security situation and that type of er conflict not being envisaged in the same way now, what we felt was important was to be able to operate er apart from main operating bases, but also from sort of general purpose erm strips, flying clubs and those type of smaller airfields and therefore rather than looking at the damaged runway situation, we looked at the smaller strips and took a length that we could sensibly operate from  erm and took that as the yardstick but clearly  notwithstanding that, there is the prospect of damaged runways and therefore the slight relaxation would also apply to damaged runways but perhaps damaged to a lesser extent.
I think perhaps if I just add a point to that er although we have as four nations  agreed on the revised requirement there, I believe it's true to say that development has progressed to such an extent that probably we will have the original requirement in practice, even though we've no longer specified it.
That's very encouraging.
For no extra charge.
Can we then look at the reduced engine thrust  erm this presumably would have a significant impact on combat performance, er why is there any change in the  security situation that would warrant such a a relaxation?
Yes the particular item that was deleted was known as the combat override facility which erm was really a trade off erm  to provide extra thrust against the reduced life of the engine and clearly if one operates at the top end of the engine  spectrum in er  hotter conditions and higher er R P M then clearly the life of the engine will be reduced.
Now we had originally had this extra facility available er so that we could trade off life against the extra thrust in an emergency but there was clearly the possibility erm that that might be used er when it really wasn't necessary and we would end up with extra  costs, extra life cycle costs, shorter engine life and it was felt on balance that with a reduced threat overall that it was sensible to take out that facility and to accept  a longer engine life, but not, there's no reduction in the total normal thrust but its merely its override combat facility.
I it doesn't speak very highly if I may say so Group Captain, for R A F discipline if what you're telling me and telling the committee that you think that pilots should be using this facility, would be using this facility when they're ordered not to.
No I wasn't suggesting that Mr Chairman.
Well why would it be used in circumstances when it was not needed otherwise?
I was only thinking really of erm  particularly extreme situations erm  and I would expect it to be used for example in normal training or anything like that and er certainly all the studies show that the normal thrust, full thrust that was available was sufficient to meet the threat and this extra capability really was a a sort of  an extra that was added in early on and really wasn't felt on any of the combat modelling to be necessary.
I think I would actually like to pursue that point Group Captain but I I think I'd rather pursue it in in the closed session than an open session.
Now can we move on to the reduced quantities of role equipment.
Can you tell us what  role equipment items have been deleted.
Yes, it was not so much a deletion as er a reduction in the numbers because we were very mindful erm in  going through the requirement erm and not making significant changes as far as the U K was concerned and we needed to make some savings in cost if at all possible and therefore we carried out a very comprehensive review of all the items of role equipment such as drop tanks er pylons, explosive release units and those type of things which  had been  provisionally earmarked for a very high intensive and fairly long running conflict and it was felt that if we were to make some savings then it was a sensible balance to reduce those numbers on the basis that we could save some money in the programme but at the same time many of these items could be bought later on at relatively short notice, clearly not within a conflict but in the years to come.
on that point.
Erm  as far as the drop tanks are concerned, does that have any impact on the range or are you just talking about the numbers that you will have  spare?
They're purely on on the numbers, the same er stand, the different sizes would still be available, there would merely be fewer of them in total stocks.
But would you envisage that the numbers er of aircraft actually kitted out with these things have been reduced  or are you talking about having spares in case they get lost or damaged?
No the the very name, as the name implies, in many cases we would er jettison the drop tanks before entering combat and er therefore there is an agreed rate at which we would expect to use them so that they are a a usable stock in operations   .
and in training presumably  do you drop them in training or do you not?
No, not normally, no.
So it's only operational.
Yes.
And can you give an indication of how quickly these things could be ordered  in an emergency?
Perhaps I can take that one er Group Captain.
Once the  erm drop tanks have been developed and have entered production  in most of the lead time one associates with providing a capability has er has actually been avoided so we could re-order probably within a year.
Very reassuring Mr Gordon, I, we're not necessarily gonna have a year's warning that that we're going to need these aircraft in the event of war.
Well, that of course er may be true but er  as the Group Captain has has said here in the reduced  er  spec position which we now face and judgement was taken as to how much we should invest in stocks of reserve drop tanks at this point and the option exists to order more.
Can I ask  it's absolutely meaningless to me, do you mean a month, three months, nine months, eleven months, eleven and a half months, what do you mean?
No what I mean is that er  once the item is in production  if you wish to order another hundred drop tanks or another thousand drop tanks  if you make that order then approximately one year later you would receive deliveries of those tanks against that order.
Now that would be the normal peacetime lead time if we could  accelerate that in industry and find some way of doing it then it may well be possible to do in quicker time than that.
So in approximately one year you might be fourteen months or fifteen months?
I  I'm er quoting a hypothetical situation here that we have entered production with er production line for drop tanks maybe producing two, three thousand tanks against a projected usage for the next ten years and sometime during that period we decide you want to order an additional thousand tanks  two thousand tanks then you could adjust the rate at which the deliveries occur, you could adjust the the the total quantity and with about a years notice industry can get in the materials and produce the goods for you.
Does that answer your question?
If er there was a crisis and there was a need for a rush order  er one would be talking of  weeks for something that is predesigned to start coming off the production line.
experience during the Falklands war and during Gulf war indicated that once an item was in production  tremendous acceleration is possible in the real war situation.
Yes.
I was discussing a year for a normal peacetime lead time.
Presumably drop tanks aren't  lost very often in peace time, it's  operations that you've actually jettisoned, is that right?
That is absolutely right, correct.
Bruce George.
Thank you,i do you feel a little uneasy at changing operational requirements based on er  an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two, ninety three, which I presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty.
So how confident are you that potential adversaries will not have the capability in two thousand and twenty to make a mess of our runways as the Soviets would have done during the er the cold war?
Erm I'm asking this question to e satisfy myself that these changes and reduction in costs are not the result of political expediency as opposed to er a genuine  assessment of what the risk in the change environment is likely to be.
fine.
That is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four chiefs of defence staff, they were asking that kind of question and I'll now ask the Group Captain to respond.
Yes er I think perhaps the point I'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one  er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact.
Well  the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing, being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel, weapons, ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is is not difficult.
Peter 
My I move to er questions about the er comparison between the erm Eurofighter and other  fighters it might find itself in combat with.
Well Peter I'm sorry but the notice only said once,Winston is meant to lead us into that I'm sorry.
Right I'm sorry .
Winston Churchill.
When you updated er the combat analysis using the latest data on Eurofighter  did you again compare er Eurofighter with alternatives such as an updated F sixteen or F fifteen er previous combat modelling showed that an alternative aircraft er  apart from the F twenty two, did not approach the capability of Eurofighter.
Did the latest modelling confirm this and what is the next best alternative in terms of capability.
Right, Group Captain Granville White.
Yes wh when they reported to the committee two years ago erm I explained that there was combat modelling going on at at the time and indeed that was completed by the end of nineteen ninety two and it showed  that er of all the alternatives available then Eurofighter two thousand was the most cost effective solution to the R A F's requirements and yet it would it would not be able to meet up er to the F twenty two but other than that it was superior to all other aircraft.
At the moment erm  because of the extra time we've got available because production investment has been delayed because of ministerial decisions, we've set in train three further studies and they will look collectively at alternatives, comparison in combat modelling and also in the  numbers  and if I could describe those three very briefly because I think they're the they're relevant to what we're talking about.
The  the two, initially there are two studies which will look into numbers, one of those is a top downs study which is based on scenarios and will look at erm a variety of different situations around the world from an analytical point of view.
The second one is erm a bottom up study which is based on today's commitments but projecting them forward into the timescale in which we will have the aircraft and looking in that way to see how many and and in what way we would need them.
The third one focusing in specifically on the combat modelling is what is known as a C O E I A which is a combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisal and this work is being carried out at Farnborough and we're comparing in single roles and multi-role Eurofighter two thousand against different aircraft.
So for example, in the specialist air defence er side we're looking  at alternatives would be the F twenty two  erm the current tornado F three and also an upgraded variant of the F three.
In the ground attack side we're comparing it to the jaguar that it'll replace, the harrier G R seven and also the tornado G R four and then in the multi-role arena for air defence, air superiority and attack we're comparing our aircraft against the French Raphall the American F eighteen E which is the the future variant of the F eighteen, the F fifteen E, the multi-role  but primarily air to surface machine and also the F sixteen C. Those are the ones we're currently looking at.
As the cost of  Eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the F twenty two i it becomes unaffordable and by how much would the performance of Eurofighter have to be degraded before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative?
I wonder if I could answer that in a in a different way because clearly rather there's the option, rather than reduction the operational capability which was really the er  initiative that  had begun in nineteen ninety two, there is the option of course of er adjusting the total numbers and that would er have an overall bearing on the total programme cost but cert because certainly the judgement of the er  the chiefs of staff was that er as far as the U K was concerned then we we should retain the operational capability as I explained earlier an n and not decrease it in any significant extent because if we did that then we could end up er with an inferior capability against a potential threat.
During the last year erm when we were working on the requirement, we carried out a number of erm comparisons descoping or aircraft in various respects.
For example taking out the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track, taking out the the M I D S, the multiple information distribution system and certain aspects of the er defensive aids, to see what impact that would have and we found that if we removed any one of those  erm then we would either come down to parity against potential threat or possibly er inferiority and that was really the supporting evidence to retain the full capability.
But Group Captain are you saying that as er a platform it has not been degraded at all, there's basically no change in thrust, in turn rate or  in airframe G loading?
Yes, that's correct.
Thank you.
Peter was your question answered or not?
No in the air superiority role I didn't hear a comparison with the S U thirty five or the Fulcrum M E twenty nine S er are there any other aircraft of er perhaps comparable capacity with which you did not compare Eurofighter?
What we've done,won one of the points I think  that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the Russians exporting all over the place but clearly  er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to, in comparing  er our aircraft against other western ones, we've also looked at them  as potential threats because it's possible that er  erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those.
But the question that young pilots would want  to know the answer to is this, erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air superiority?
No, there are none.
So you have compared with the  
And the S U?
Yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned, the S U  thirty five and the  which is an upgraded S U twenty seven and the M I G twenty nine S, yes we've specifically compared against those two.
And you've been reassured by the responses?
Yes.
Thank you Chairman.
Thank you, Michael Colgan
Yes Mr Chairman I'm not clear  erm about something that Mr Gordon said in his opening remarks that I'd like clarified and that is that he  gave the committee the impression that there were  er certain of the  of the partners  that were accepting  erm a lower specification in other words, omitting  from the  what is the British best if you like, erm certain items of of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft, both in development stage and at the production stage, final cost of the aircraft, unit cost.
Erm  we asked the question about   the aircraft's reduced operational capabilities as far as Britain is concerned, we were told that there was no reduction, erm  there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries, I mean, which countries are asking for what to be omitted  and  by how much is the percentage, in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that, picking up something that that Wing Com er Group Captain Granville White has just mentioned which i is the question of sales.
Yes.
Erm  it does obviously have a bearing on sales to tAll the way up to the free states.
Good thinkin', Huck.
Why, thank you,Jim.
- Here's some more wood,Jim.
- Right there.
Tryin' to get this fire goin'.
Come on, Duke! 
Over here!
Why are you always stealing' chickens ?
I love chickens.
They're succulent.
- We're chicken thieves !
That's as low as it gets.
- Shut up and keep runnin' !
It seems to me,Jim, whenever anybody's after anybody, it's usually me they's after.
Hello there, we's in need of assist !
- Let's get !
- You bet !
Grab the oars !
- Hold up !
I'm right behind you, Duke !
- Come on, push off!
Huh?
What the--
Hey !
Get your own raft !
- Thank you, lads. 
We'd be obliged.
- Thanks, nothin' !
- You was gonna hightail out and just leave us, wasn't ya ?
- No, I weren't. 
Honest.
- Please, sir.
- If ya don't let the boy go, how's he gonna save our hides ?
Sorry, boy.
People tryin' to kill me and...
dogs tryin' to rip my face off, and it ain't even breakfast yet.
They call me the King, the King of Bilgewater, and this here's the Duke.
Pleased to meet ya.
The King and the Duke seemed like nice enough fellas, but something about 'em made me feel mighty uneasy.
They asked us a considerable many questions.
- Yeow !
- Bull's-eye.
- And once again...
I decided it would be best to leave out the truth.
So... my ma grabbed onto the trapeze and swung one way.
My pa came a-swingin' on the other.
My ma let go, did a double flip... and missed my pa by a good six feet.
She made quite a mess when she hit them bleachers.
I think this boy's gonna fit right in.
Thank you,Jim. 
So what is it you two fellas do, exactly ?
We do a fair bit of doctoring'.
Yeah. 
We can cure cancer, paralysis, baldness.
This time we're sellin' a thing that takes tartar off of teeth.
- And it does take it off too.
- But unfortunately the...
- enamel goes right along with it.
- Yeah, well !
We also do some theatre.
Tragedy, you know.
Yeah, we got enough... 
Shakespearean costumes here for the lot of us.
But what we do best are the three Es.
Robbery, forgery... and burglary.
Hell's bells !
I wish I knew a good trade.
Well, maybe we'll teach you one, huh?
Yeow ! 
Go-- You skinny little rat bag !
I'm gonna wring your skinny little neck !
Hey, watch it !
Stop pecking' at me !
- Oh, good morning, boys.
- Good morning.
Aw, hello, Duke.
- We gotta run, now, huh ?
- Naw, naw, naw, naw.
- I just been borrowing' a few things.
- Ah, yeah.
Nobody saw me.
But lookee what I found.
- You were headin' for your Uncle Billy's plantation, huh ?
- Now, wait a minute.
You're a runaway murdering'slave's what you are.
I think maybe I'll just collect that reward.
- He only murdered me.
- Now, look, we ain't exactly the type... to turn others into the law.
We stay as far away from the law as is humanly possible.
So if you two just, uh--
Listen up and shut up and do as you're told...
-and wait on us hand and foot...
- and be real nice to us, we won't say a word.
You step out of line, try and run and--
Oh, ho ho!
Easy prey.
- I'm all right!
- Ya think?
- I do.
- Shall we ?
- Let's.
Hello, there!
Happy morn to ya!
And a good mornin' to you all too !
Say, you wouldn't happen to be... the Wilks brothers, now, would ya?
- Yes.
- No !
- No.
- My name is Blodgett, Dr. Alexander Blodgett.
This here is Franciscus, uh,
Adolphus and Jim.
- Oh, shoot.
- Adolphus ?
- I reckon it don't matter.
They already missed it anyways.
- Missed ? 
What ?
Was an, um, economic opportunity they missed, huh ?
Oh, ho ho !
No, no, no.
They'll get the money and the property all right, but... they missed the death of their brother Peter Wilks... down at Phelps Landing.
He died.
Last night.
- Too bad.
- So sad.
Yup. 
He said he ain't seen his two brothers... in more than 20 years.
Yeah ? 
So, uh, why did you think we was them ?
Well, one of the brothers, the preacher ?
He's a lot older.
And the one that's deaf and dumb... he's a lot younger, see.
So when I saw you two, I just reckoned maybe-- 
- Are you leaving the area for a while ?
- I'm goin' to New Orleans.
Well, methinks this calls for a small libation!
- Ha ha ha ha !
- I'll drink to that !
Right this way, my gold-toothed friend !
We in trouble, Huck.
The King and the Duke found out... that the dead guy's brothers lived over in England.
They hadn't had much time to get the letter... and might not have gotten it at all.
So those two rat bags grilled that flathead... about everything and everybody in his village, right down to the damn dog next door.
- Woof!
- Mighty smart of ya !
Mighty smart of ya.
Was Peter Wilks well off?
Oh, he was, uh, he was as rich as King Soromon himself.
I tell you,Jim, the hand of providence is bound to take a swing at them two.
And knowin' them, they'll duck.
How are you at playing a preacher ?
- How are you at playin' deaf and dumb ?
- Pardon ?
- Heh heh heh heh heh !
- Ha ha ha ha !
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Attention, passengers!
jubilee leaving for Phelps Landing in 1 5 minutes!
Do I have to wear this?
Wanted to learn a trade, didn't ya ?
- Why can't we just wait here ?
- Because I don't trust ya.
You'd hightail it for sure, and we need to leave this raft here for our getaway.
Besides, we'll be more convincing... after we arrive with an innocent young boy as our valet.
Who you callin' innocent ?
Look, you wouldn't want us to accidentally turn in... your runaway slave friend, now, would ya ?
Come on. 
Play along with us for a couple of days.
We'll give ya 1 0 percent.
20.
- 1 5.
- Deal.
- You never looked better!
- I have too looked better!
- You're beautiful !
- I feel ridiculous!
- Hey, King !
- Yeah ?
- Let's go buy those tickets.
- All right.
- Be right back.
- Shoo! 
Shoo, fly!
Shoo !
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha !
Funny, Huck. 
Very funny.
What in hell's bells are you supposed to be ?
The King said I was a Swahili warrior.
Even taught me some Swahili, or what he said was Swahili.
- Sounded like a pig in heat to me.
- Hee hee.
I'd poked around a little... and found out that a steamboat was leavin'... from Phelps Landing the day after tomorrow... and heading'all the way up to Cairo.
So all we had to do was put up with them rat bags for two more days, then it was off to freedom.
Uh, begging your pardon on this, can any of you good people tell me... where Mr. Peter Wilks lives ?
I'm looking for Mr. Peter Wilks.
Get out of the way, for heaven's sake.
Peter's brothers, right ?
Uh, heh-heh-heh.
- I can tell by your fancy accent.
- But we're sorry to say... we can only tell you where Peter did live... up until yesterday.
Oh. 
What you're tellin'me, I think, is that my dear, sweet brother Peter... has gone to the Lord.
He held on for you as long as he could, but yesterday he passed.
And we came all the way from England.
Alas. 
Alas.
And we never got to see him.
Excuse me.
I must communicate with me deaf brother.
- I told you before, she's my woman!
- No, she's not!
Hey, don't I know you two ?
Yeah, I do !
You're that--
Stand aside !
Welcome to America !
My dear, sweet MaryJane.
- Uncle Harvey.
- Ho-ho-ho!
Mmm, mmm--
Enough. 
Heh-heh.
Ah,you're as blooming'beautiful as Peter said you was.
- You sure are.
- Ha ha ha!
This is my, uh, valet, Adolphus.
My English valet, right ?
Right, right. 
Heh.
- Isn't he the sweetest looking boy ?
- Why, thank you, missus !
Heh-heh.
Oh, and this is my Swahili warrior...
I picked up in Africa on a safari with the Duke of York.
He makes a great slave.
Yeah. 
Yes, of course.
Er, might we, uh, pay our respects to our brother's remainders ?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Rather, William.
Uh, my brother says... he'd like to invite friends of the family for supper, people mentioned by our dear Peter so often in his letters.
- No, I won't forget-- 
- You know, we might just prosper... hanging around with them two.
More than likely, we'll get our necks stretched.
Well, that old King juiced it plenty, spittin'out word-for-word everything that young flathead told him.
And how's that damn dog next door ?
Smelly as the dickens.
Oh, thank ya ever so.
So I says to the pope,
" Pope, I'd like to stay and help ya, but I've got a blinking'job to do... down in the bloomin' Indian Ocean saving' the blinking' pirates."
Watch yourself, Huck.
She's just a girl,Jim.
Adolphus, have you ever seen the king ?
- Him ? 
Oh, yeah. 
William III.
- George IV.
Oh, the King of England !
Oh, why didn't you bloody say so ?
Course I have.
He goes to our church, regular.
But I thought he lived in London.
- Well, he does.
- But you live in Sheffield.
That is to say... he goes to our church when he's in Sheffield.
Do you go to church ?
Of course I do.
We got our own pew right up front.
- Whose pew ?
- Why, ours. 
Your Uncle Harvey's, of course.
What would he need a pew for ?
Isn't he preaching up in the pulpit ?
My thoughts exactly.
Now, do you suppose... there ain't but one bloody, blinkin' preacher to a bloomin' church ?
- What would they want more for ?
- Style.
If it's a priest before a king, you got to have lots of style goin' on.
In our church, we've got 1 7 bloody, blinking', blooming'preachers.
- Where's Buckingham Palace?
- In Buckingham.
- Who's the King married to ?
- His wife.
- What's her name ?
- Uh, the queen.
- Queen what ?
- Queen of England.
Ha ! 
You don't know anything, do ya ?
Well, I think...
-you're the biggest fibber-- 
-Susan!
How dare you speak to him so, him being a stranger in a strange land, so far from his own people.
He was telling a few stretchers, and I wasn't swallowing them.
You apologize to him this instant.
I apologize, Adolphus.
You're a dear, sweet boy.
I'm ashamed I called you a fibber.
- Women.
- Here, now, have some pie and milk,
- because you are so sweet.
- Why, thank you ever so.
And these are the girls we're lettin' those reptiles... rob of their money.
- A right good day, MaryJane !
- Good day to you, Adolphus.
Ah, we've just been... for a marvellous walk in the woods.
What a lovely country !
Ha-ha-ha !
A right good day, sirs !
Would you happen to know where the-- the great Swahili warrior's sleepin' ?
We decided the Swahili bit was pushing it and asked him to wait at the raft.
Well, what about-- 
- A good lad !
- Here it is, Uncle.
Father said only you should open it.
Oh. 
Bless him.
" Last Will and Testament of PeterJ. 
Wilks.
I, PeterJ. 
Wilks, being of sound mind..."
Well, the dead geezer gave the girls his houses, the slaves, and thousands of dollars in gold.
Then he gave more gold...
"to my dear, beloved brothers Harvey and William."
Praise be to the Lord.
Er, "The gold is hidden in the barn behind the vineyards."
Well, William, I guess we better go and get it.
- Well ?
- Well ?
There, behind the grindstone.
Aah ! 
Allow me.
Wow !
Begging your pardon !
Hmph !
If this ain't bully, nothing is.
Like I told you this morning, we're goin' all the way with this one.
All for us and none for them.
Let's count it.
I don't think it's right, us stealing from them nice girls.
You're in it now, you little stinkweed.
- Right up to your sneaky little eyeballs.
-And if it goes wrong--
You'll take your punishment right along with us.
Ya know what they'll do if they catch us ?
Ya know what happens to ya when they tar and feather ya ?
- Do ya ?
- No, sirs !
No, I-
- I don't know !
The tar oozes into your pores.
Clogs 'em up real tight.
- Suffocates your skin.
- Ya get all green and sick.
Then ya choke and ya cough.
Until ya tear your own flesh so's ya can breathe.
But ya can't breathe !
And half the time, ya die from it.
And those that don't die... feel so bad, they wish that they had.
And that's just what'll happen to you if ya open your mouth.
Hey.
Maybe young Adolphus here has the right idea.
We should give the money back to the girls.
That's a dazzling idea, King.
- That'll knock over their suspicions.
- Shut 'em up for good.
- Until we steal it all back.
- Yeah, we give them the money... and that gives us the time to steal everything else.
Genius.
We're gonna be set for life !
I'd had enough, and steamboat or no steamboat,
I figured it were time to grabJim... and hightail it to Cairo.
Heh-heh. 
Friends, our dear departed... has done generous to his little lambs, and as their uncles,
I think we'd like to enhance... the generous spirit of the day.
You see, I knew he'd feel the same as me.
MaryJane,Julia, Susan, take the money.
Take it all.
A gift from your uncles.
- Wonderful !
- Dear souls, how could you ?
Englishman, my butt !
You're a couple of frauds.
I beg your pardon.
And who might you be ?
Dr. Robinson, ain't you heard?
They're Peter's brothers.
Doctor-- Dr. Robinson ! 
Oh !
My brother's, oh, good friend and physician.
Take your hand away from me, you impostor !
They proved it 40 ways that they're the brothers.
- They even knew everything about the village!
- And everybody's name !
- They even know about the damn dog next door.
- Enough !
They came here with lots of names and facts... they must've picked up somewhere, that's all.
Yup, it was time to leave, all right.
I could smell the winds a-changin', and they stunk.
Turn these rascals out, I beg you.
They're liars.
Based on what evidence?
Here's my answer, doctor.
Uncle Harvey, Uncle William, take the gold back... and invest it for me and my sisters any way you want.
That's my answer, doctor.
Whooo!
Marvellous.
I hated to run out on them sweet girls, but I figured if I stuck around, that dead geezer 'n'me would be sharin'lodgin's.
Hey, you seen a big slave around, maybe hanging' on my raft ?
You bet I was. 
Two men catched him, and now he's in jail.
- What ?
- They had a handbill... that said he was a murderer and a runaway...
- and worth $400.
- So where is he now ?
Took him down to the jail in Phelps Landing.
- Phelps Landing.
- Yeah, we're gonna keep him there... until we can take him up north for the hanging'.
I'm gonna fix their wagons but good.
I'd come all the way down the Mississippi... and hadn't gotten anywhere, and I realized right then that ya can't run away from your problems, ya gotta make a stand and face 'em.
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.
I didn't want to get you in any trouble.
Good, because my butt's hangin' way out, and I'd rather not get it shot off.
I got to tell 'em you're not a murderer.
That don't matter.
Me bein' a runaway's even worse than me bein' a murderer.
The steamboat leaves the wharf at 1 0:00 tomorrow tonight.
Don't you worry,Jim.
We'll both be on it.
There's something I got to tell ya before you risking yourself for me.
You know that night on the steamboat with all them murderers ?
Yeah.
Your Pap was one of'em.
I saw him, and he was dead.
Dead ?
Pap's dead ?
- You saw him and you didn't tell me ?
- I'm sorry.
I'm dreadful sorry.
I was so selfish.
That was a lie,Jim.
That was a lie !
And I thought we were friends.
I did wrong.
Ain't no gettin' around it.
Now I'm gonna get what I deserve.
- Hey, boy!
- Take care of yourself, Mr. Finn.
Now, where have you been, you little turd pie ?
just playin' with the damn dog next door.
Just playing with the little doggies ?
I oughta--
Just stay right here today !
Understand ? 
Hmm ?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!
What's that old fool up to now?
Me dear brother and I have a little announcement we'd like to make.
It don't seem right... for William and I to leave these little lambs... without any kinfolk around.
So we have decided, er, MaryJane, Julia, Susan--
We have decided... to take you back with us to England !
We'll be havin' an auction tomorrow mornin'... after the funeral,
- so tell one and all !
- We will be selling everything !
We're going to England !
I figured that before I took off,
I'd grab that gold away from them two frauds.
Then when I was long gone,
I'd write MaryJane and tell her where I hid it.
Well, what is it ?
Make it quick.
I gotta tell ya, King, I'm just not comfortable.
That doctor's been layin' on my mind all day.
We should just glide out of here tonight with what we got.
And not sell the rest of the property?
I reckon these sacks of gold are plenty for me.
I figure we should just knock off and light out.
We can't leave thousands of dollars worth of property lying around.
What about the damn doctor?
Forget about the doctor !
He's the only one that's suspicious.
Everyone else is on our side!
Now, look, Duke, old friend.
My brains and your bullocks, we ain't never gonna get caught.
Yeah, all right.
Well,just let me take another peek at that gold... before we head back down.
Slice of heaven, King.
Feels like a slice of heaven.
Come on !
My Pap were a bad one, but he were my Pap.
If you see him, tell him Huck says hello.
Good night!
Where's the stiff?
- What ? 
Who ?
- The coffin ! 
Where's the coffin ?
We buried him this morning.
And ever since, Uncle Harvey's been having the auction.
First thing he sold were the slaves.
He separated the families.
- Come on !
- Where are we going?
- Got any friends out in the country ?
- Yes, the Lothrups. 
Why ?
If I tell you somethin', promise not to come back here until 1 0:00 tonight.
- Now, why would I do that ?
-Just promise me, MaryJane !
All right, I-- I promise. 
Say... what happened to your accent ?
Those uncles of yours ain't no uncles at all.
They ain't even English.
Dr. Robinson was right.
Them two are liars and frauds.
- What ?
- Don't you worry ! 
I got the gold.
When this all blows over, I'll write and tell ya where it's buried.
Oh, no. 
I'm gonna get those two right now and get 'em tarred--
No, you're not, MaryJane.
You promised me.
Why until 1 0:00 ?
'Cause there's a good-hearted fellow I gotta save, and at 1 0:00, we'll be gone.
Come on.
Well, why do I have to leave town ?
Why can't I just pretend I don't know ?
Because there ain't an easier book to read than your face.
You'd give it away for sure.
Even $225... $225... $225... $2 40... $27 5... $300... now higher...
- $350.
- $37 5... $37 5...
- Yeah.
- $37 5 and a $400.
Even $400. 
Sold, $400 !
Let's sell the next lot.
MaryJane was safe, the gold was safe, them reptiles would soon be in jail, and at 1 0.00 tonight,Jim and me would be on a steamboat... headin'for Cairo.
All I had to do was find that deputy, steal his keys, and break Jim oouut!
- Oh, I told you...
- Let me go !
- not to disappear ! 
Didn't I ?
- Let me go !
Oh, now, don't kill him...just yet.
Answer up, and quick.
- Were you in our room last night ?
- No, your maj-
- Unh !
Where is our money ?
I ain't seen it since MaryJane gave it to ya.
Honest, your majesties !
If I stole it, would I still be here ?
No, I guess not, unless you're a complete numskull.
Uh-oh.
Here's another set of Wilks brothers !
Just got here on the Mississippi Queen!
Ya pays your money and ya takes your pick !
Now is the hour of your demise, you impostors !
What's this all about, my good sir ?
- Please let the man through!
- That's right!
I'm with you, Harvey.
I am Harvey Wilks, and this is my brother William.
And you two gentlemen are quite a surprise to us.
And you to us, sir.
But I must say, you should have worked on your English accent a wee bit more !
For this town has few fools, and only a fool would be fooled by that foolish accent.
That's the worst English accent I ever heard.
- Ain't nothin' like yours, Harve.
- I'm not very well fixed... to show proof of these frauds at the moment, for last night, all our bags were put off by mistake.
- Convenient mistake, huh ?
- Yeah, convenient.
What are you doing ?
What's he doing ?
Making deaf and dumb signs, that's what he's doing.
- Don't your brother know how ?
- Those are just nonsense !
And of course William can do real ones, only he broke his arm in a fall.
Ah-ha-ha !
Broke his arm, very likely, for a man who's got to make deaf signs to prove himself.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Now, I'm not sure these two are the real Wilks brothers, but by God, I know them two sure ain't.
By the way, Adolphus,
- are you from England ?
- Why, yes, I am.
Speak the truth now, or by God, there's gonna be one less idiot around here.
That is to say, sir,
I'm originally from Missouri, but several years ago, I was sent to England... to live with my great-grandfather,
- the Duke of Bilgewater.
- Bilgewater ?
But he died last year, and his good friend,
Mr. Harvey Wilks here, took me in.
Personally, I think you're just a damn good liar.
Why, thank you for the compliment, sir.
All right, enough.
We're gonna figure out who's who right here and now, and nobody's goin' nowhere until we do.
Well, they sailed into the investigation, hour in and hour out, the King tellin' one story and Harvey Wilks another.
But no one knew nothin' about England, so they couldn't figure out who was lyin'.
Although most people were comin' to believe they both was.
I got it ! 
I got it !
I can prove I'm Harvey Wilks and these men frauds !
Why didn't I think of it sooner?
Now, who here helped lay out my brother-  the late Peter Wilks-- in his coffin ? 
Hmm ?
- They did!
Me and Abe here dressed him up and layed him out ourselves.
All right, then.
Perhaps you can tell me what was tattooed on Peter's breast.
Come on!
Come on, out with it!
We want to hear it!
- Out with it !
- Yeah !
All right, all right.
I can tell you what was tattooed on his breast, all right.
You'd have to look real close to notice it.
Just tell us what the tattoo is about !
Come on, out with it!
Tell him !
- Come on !
- Get to it !
It was a small... thin... blue...
- arrow!
- Arrow?
- Yes ! 
There !
You all heard what he said ?
- Yeah!
Did you see any such mark ?
- Nope.
- Nope.
You fraud !
That's right, because there isn't any blue arrow.
Peter had his initials tattooed on his breast, the letters " P" and "W".
Well, come on, then!
Isn't that what you saw ?
I didn't see any tattoo, did you ?
I never noticed no tattoo at all !
They're all frauds !
- I say we tar 'em !
- Yeah !
- I say we shoot 'em !
- Yeah!
- I say we hang 'em !
- Yeah !
Hang 'em !
Hang all of'em !
Gentlemen ! 
Gentlemen !
There is one way to see which pair is the real Wilks brothers, or if neither of them is !
Let's dig up the corpse !
Yeah !
To the cemetery !
We've got the tar !
Well ?
Dig it up !
- Hey, we found it, doc !
- They hit it !
All right, heave!
Won't be long now, Deputy Hines!
- Push it! 
Push it!
- Got it ?
- Almost got it!
Push!
- Eeewwhh !
- Oh !
My good God !
There's gold in there !
Aah !
It's the Wilks' gold !
We'd best be goin', Jim !
Huck ? 
I thought you'd have your neck stretched by now !
I'm a little quicker than that.
- Why, Huck ?
- Why, what ?
Why'd ya come and get me ?
'Cause you're my friend,Jim.
Oh, come on.
Now, let's get to that steamboat!
- Come on !
- It's the boy with that runaway slave !
- Hit the trail!
- Get 'em !
Fire !
Aah! 
Unh!
You all right, Huck ?
I just tripped. 
I'm all right.
Keep goin' !
Unh ! 
Unh !
Last call for Cairo and all points north!
All aboard!
Almost there, Huck !
We made it, Huck !
Huck ?
Oh! 
Oh, my little friend!
Oh. 
Oh.
- Go on,Jim. 
Go on.
- I ain't goin' nowhere without you.
- What are ya doin',Jim?
They'll catch ya.
They won't find ya in the dark.
I got to get ya to a doctor.
I'll be okay.
Ya--
Ya can't take me,Jim.
They'll catch ya.
They'll lynch ya.
- Don't go,Jim.
- Last call for Cairo!
Last call for Cairo!
- All aboard!
- I don't care what happens to me, Huck.
I just want to get you well.
Jim...
Jim...
We had us a great adventure, didn't we,Jim ?
- We sure did, Huck.
- And I'd do it all over again.
Yeah.
Get 'em !
Oh !
You can't-- You can't kill him.
Don't you cry for me, Mr. Finn.
You're the best friend I ever had,Jim.
You're the only friend I ever had.
Ya can't.
Aah ! 
No !
Jim !
No, ya can't take him.
He's all I got.
Ready ?
- Tighten it up.
- Aah ! 
Aah !
Leave the boy alone! 
He's innocent!
- Now, MaryJane !
- And if he was trying to help that slave, he had a good reason for it.
Now you let them both go!
Now !
Aw, let him go.
Lucky day, boy!
You're awake.
He's awake.
He's awake !
Sweetie, we were so worried about you but you're going to be all right now.
My little Huckleberry !
Widow Douglas.
Why, how'd you get here ?
Lands, child.
You've been out cold for a week.
When I heard what happened, I took the first steamer down.
Well, I'm sure ya think I'm low-down and miserable... for tryin' to setJim free,
- but do ya hate me ?
- Not at all, child.
I'm right proud of you. 
Just because an idea is popular, like slavery, don't make it right.
That's whatJim told me.
Your little heart guided you quite well.
Hey,Jim !
You lie still, and I'll bring you some soup.
Well, look at you.
What is it,Jim ?
Did somebody do something to you ?
- 'Cause if they did, why-- 
- Miss Watson died.
A few weeks ago.
And, well, she was so ashamed... that she was going to sell me away from my wife and my children, that... she set me free in her will, Huck.
I'm a free man, Huck.
I'm a free man.
Children, come here, please.
- Mr. Jenkins!
- Good-bye, Adolphus Huckleberry.
Well, I healed upjust fine.
MaryJane and her sisters, along with the Wilks brothers, gave me $500 for my troubles and my chivalrousness.
But since I got no real use for money, I gave it all toJim... for his family.
The Widow Douglas said she'd adopt me... and take me home and try and civilize me... but I don't know if I could stand it... 'cause I've been there before.
Now, where did Huckleberry go to ?

"AND THE HANDSOME PRINCE SAID ALL THESE WORDS.
THE END."

BUT HE COULDN'T GET HIS AUNT CONNIE, HUH?
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN AUNT CONNIE.
HIS NAME'S NOT EVEN CHUNG.
WELL...
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO ARE IN THE MARKET
FOR A MAJOR TV STAR.
OH, KIMMY, KIMMY, KIMMY.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE YOUR PEOPLE CALL MY PEOPLE?
I'LL DO IT.
THANKS, BECKY.
BE THERE RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.
OK.
WHOA, GIRLS, UH...
CAN'T A GUY MAKE A JOKE?
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY PEOPLE.
YOU'RE MY PEOPLE.
IT'S OK, DAD.
YOU CAN DO IT.
I SHOULD'VE ASKED YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN CHUNG-MANIA.
OH, DIDN'T WE ALL.
WHAT IS THIS?
THIS ISN'T WHAT WE ORDERED.
WE ORDERED A LIBRARY SET, NOT A BATHROOM SET.
OK, STRIKE IT.
STRIKE THE SET.
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?
THIS WAS MS. GARLAND'S IDEA.
OK, PEOPLE, BACK TO WORK.
COME ON, LET'S MOVE IT.
LET'S GO.
I JUST COULDN'T SEE THE I.Q. MAN IN A LIBRARY.
IN FACT, THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
THE MORE I SAW YOU IN THE SHOWER.
WHY WOULD I WEAR A SMOKING JACKET IN THE SHOWER?
EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY YOU'LL BE WEARING THIS.
AND ACTION!
I WANT TO KNOW
IF I CAN LIVE WITH WHAT I KNOW...
AND ONLY THAT.
CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT.
JESS, THE CONCEPT IS THE I.Q. MAN,
NOT THE I.Q. HEAD.
TOO BAD. 
THE HEAD'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING.
MAYBE ICE COLD WATER
WILL HELP HIM OVER HIS SHYNESS.
OHH! 
OK, OK!
I'M OUT! 
I'M OUT!
GOOD.
NO, NO.
NO NEED TO DRY OFF.
IN FACT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR BODY...
WETTER.
THE WETTER, THE BETTER.
EXCUSE US, WON'T YOU?
JOSEPH, HOP ON.
YOU SEE? 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
I'M NOTHING BUT A BIG MAC IN A BATH TOWEL.
JOEY, I'M NOT A HAMBURGER.
I HAPPEN TO BE A HUMAN BEING.
JESS, BUDDY, AS LONG AS I'M THE DIRECTOR,
YOU WILL BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
THANK YOU.
OK, HOSE HIM DOWN.
HOLD IT!
WATCH THE HAIR.
EXCUSE ME.
TAKE TWO.
OK, THIS TIME, GIVE ME MORE STEAM.
AND ACTION!
I WANT--
[COUGH]
I WANT TO KNOW
IF I CAN LIVE--
[COUGH]
WITH WHAT I KNOW...
AND ONLY THAT.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
I CAN'T RESIST.
IS IT HIS EYES?
IS IT HIS SMILE?
IS IT HIS--
STOP.
IF YOU MUST LOVE ME,
LOVE ME FOR MY I-- MY I--
I'M IN A BATH TOWEL.
I'M IN A BATH TOWEL HERE.
COME ON, JESSE, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
IT'S NOT WORKING, OK?
HE'S RIGHT, IT'S NOT WORKING.
THANK YOU.
THAT TOWEL'S MUCH TOO BIG.
CUT. 
CUT.
NOT YOU!
NOT YOU!
JESSE...
I WON'T HURT YOU.
MALATESTA, WILL YOU HELP ME OUT HERE, PLEASE?
SHE'S THE CLIENT.
SHE'S CHASING ME WITH SCISSORS.
SO? 
STOP RUNNING.
I WON'T STAND HERE AND BE EXPLOITED BY YOU.
KATSOPOLIS, AS LONG AS YOU'RE WORKING FOR ME,
YOU WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAYS.
OK. 
FROM NOW ON, WE DON'T WORK FOR YOU.
WE QUIT.
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE WAS WORKING
FOR A SPINELESS JELLYFISH LIKE YOU.
WHAT?
UH, SIR, YOU KNOW, IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD,
A SPINELESS JELLYFISH IS CONSIDERED A DELICACY.
LET'S GO.
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, GLADSTONE.
YOU KNOW JUST WHEN TO KISS UP.
I AM A KISS-UP, AREN'T I?
ONE OF THE BEST.
I SOLD YOU OUT, DIDN'T I?
JOEY, YOU HOSED ME DOWN.
JOSEPH, WE'RE PARTNERS...
AND FRIENDS.
THIS MAN IS NOT A HAMBURGER,
AND I AM NOT A SIDE OF FRIES,
AND YOU, SIR, ARE A...
CHICKEN McNUGGET!
JOEY, ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT
OR ORDER A HAPPY MEAL?
WE'RE QUITTING.
THAT'S MY PARTNER.
COME ON. 
WE GOT BETTER PLACES TO BE.
WE JUST LOST OUR JOBS.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
CAREER DAY.
THANKS MR. KRAUS FOR INTRODUCING US
TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MEAT.
AND NOW, AS WE MOVE INTO THE FIELD OF TV ENTERTAINMENT,
I'LL LIKE TO APOLOGIZE ONCE AGAIN
FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CONNIE CHUNG INCIDENT.
MAN!
AW, MAN!
BUT, JUST AS EXCITING,
WE HAVE THE CO-HOSTS OF WAKE UP, SAN FRANCISCO.
LET'S GIVE IT UP
FOR DANNY TANNER AND REBECCA DONALDSON!
HOO! 
HOO!

AND WE LISTEN, AND WE...
FINISH EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.
OK. 
NOW, LOOKING AS I AM RIGHT NOW
AT YOUR BEAUTIFUL, SHINY, ROUND LITTLE FACES,
I'M REMINDED OF MY FIRST JOB IN TELEVISION.
I WAS ASSISTANT STOCK BOY AT ANTENNA TOWN.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF A LONG STORY--
DANNY, LOOK.
OUR FIRST QUESTION.
HOW TALL IS CONNIE CHUNG?
CONNIE CHUNG IS NOT HERE.
I AM, AND I'M 6'4".
THANKS A LOT.
YEAH, BUT IF SHE WERE HERE, HOW TALL WOULD SHE BE?
WHO DOES CONNIE'S HAIR?
YEAH.
THAT'S IT!
LET'S FACE IT.
CONNIE CHUNG COULDN'T MAKE IT,
SO JUST GET OVER IT.
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
FROM AN EXCITING WORLD OF ADVERTISING,
JESSE KATSOPOLIS AND JOEY GLADSTONE.
COME ON DOWN!
THANKS, GUYS.
"THANKS, GUYS"?
THAT'S IT FOR ME AND REBECCA?
THE BUTCHER HAD 10 MINUTES.
SORRY DAD, BUT CLASS IS ALMOST OVER,
AND THE BUTCHER GAVE OUT MIDGET SALAMIS.
HEY, I'M NOT ABOVE BRIBES.
IN FACT THIS KIDS
WOULD LIKE SOME AUTOGRAPHED PICTURES OF ME.
I BROUGHT THE PICTURES I HAVE A SPECIAL FELT MARKER
AND EVERYTHING.
DANNY, IT'S OVER.
TAKE IT AWAY, BOYS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
THANK YOU.
HI.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU REALLY STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT,
THIS WHOLE CAREER THING IS OVERRATED.
I MEAN, THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE.
RIGHT, JOEY?
SURE, LIKE A WELL-BALANCED BREAKFAST.
RIGHT.
AND REALLY COOL SUNGLASSES.
YEAH, AND STRONG WATER PRESSURE IN THE SHOWER.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
YEAH. 
THAT WOULD BE...
DID YOU GUYS LOSE YOUR JOBS OR SOMETHING?
ZIP IT, GIBBLER.
WE HAVE SOMETHING
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN JOBS.
YEAH.
WE HAVE OUR INTEGRITY.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT PAY AN HOUR?
[BELL RINGS]
SO REMEMBER, KIDS,
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH
AND ALWAYS CARRY EXACT BUS CHANGE.
AND REMEMBER, NO RUNNING IN THE HALLWAYS.
I THINK YOU REALLY MOVED THEM.
YEAH.
I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU GUYS. 
WHAT HAPPENED?
OH, OUR BOSS JUST PUSHED US TOO FAR.
WE QUIT.
LOOK, I'M THE LAST ONE TO GIVE ADVICE.
OK, I'M THE FIRST ONE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO INTO BUSINESS FOR YOURSELVES.
YOU COULD WRITE AND MARKET YOUR OWN COMMERCIALS
AND DIRECT THEM FOR YOUR OWN PRODUCTION COMPANY.
YEAH, WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS.
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GET A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE EXPERIENCE,
THE TALENT, THE CONTACTS.
ALL YOU NEED IS TO RENT SOME EQUIPMENT.
AND FIND SOME STUDIO SPACE.
AND PRINT UP BUSINESS CARDS.
THAT'S IT!
WE'RE IN BUSINESS!
CONGRATULATIONS!
WE HAVE OUR OWN BUSINESS.
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
TISSUE, TISSUE, TISSUE.
AH-CHOO!
THANK YOU.
HOW RUDE.
YOU GAVE ME YOUR COLD.
TAKE IT BACK.
NO CAN DO. 
ONCE IT'S OUT OF MY NOSE,
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.
HI, GIRLS.
HI, JOEY.
HI, JOEY.
HOW ARE YOU, MICHELLE?
SHE MAKES ME SICK.
WHAT SHE MEANS IS I GAVE HER MY COLD.
WELL, I'M SORRY YOU GOT STEPHIE'S COLD,
BUT YOU KNOW THE GOOD NEWS?
SINCE YOU TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF STEPHIE,
I'M SURE STEPHIE'S GONNA TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU.
RIGHT, STEPH?
NICE GUILT TRIP, JOEY.
YEAH, IT WAS, WASN'T IT?
BYE, GIRLS.
IN THE WORDS OF MICHELLE TANNER,
"YOU, UPSTAIRS, INTO BED.
MOVE IT, MISTER.
MOVE IT."
CHILL OUT, DUDE.
HEY JOEY, BAD NEWS
FOR DOUBLE "J" CREATIVE SERVICES--
THE BANK TURNED DOWN OUR BUSINESS LOAN.
HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?
OH, I DON'T KNOWN, MAYBE 'CAUSE WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
RUNNING OUR OWN BUSINESS, NO COLLATERAL,
NO CREDIT RATING.
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY TURNED US DOWN?
HEY, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE CRANKY AND UNEMPLOYED,
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME.
GUYS, I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BANK.
AND I THINK I HAVE A WAY TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
I DON'T KNOW, DON'T TELL ME YOU GONNA SING
THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM AGAIN.
NO. 
I AM JUST GONNA HUM IT
WHILE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
[HUMMING THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM]
THIS IS A PERSONAL CHECK FROM DANNY TANNER.
[HUMMING LOUDER]
DANNY, STOP HUMMING!
[HUMS SOFTLY]
WHY ARE YOU GIVING US ALL THIS MONEY?
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU GUYS.
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR ME, I'M HAPPY TO DO THIS FOR YOU.
BUT THIS-
- THIS IS NOT A GIFT IT'S AN INVESTMENT.
I WANNA BE A PARTNER IN YOUR SUCCESS.
DANNY, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU'RE SO-- DID YOU SAY PARTNER?
WELL, SILENT PARTNER.
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY? 
I'LL BE TOTALLY CLOSE-MOUTHED.
NO BUTTING IN, I'LL KEEP MY NOSE OUT OF IT, MIND MY OWN BUSINESS.
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.
NOT A PEEP OUT OF ME.
IF YOU'D SHUT UP FOR ONE MINUTE,
WE COULD TELL YOU THAT...
YOU'RE IN.
YEAH?
ALL RIGHT!
DOUBLE "J" AND "D" CREATIVE SERVICES.
OF COURSE THE "D" IS SILENT.
[HUMMING THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM]
COME ON.
SING, BOYS.
[HUMMING THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM]
HUM WITH ME.
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.

COOPER:
Diane, 6:18 a.m., Room 315.
Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks.
Slept pretty well. 
Non-smoking room.
There's no tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the business traveler.
A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air.
As Sheriff Truman indicated they would, everything this hotel promised, they've delivered.
Clean, reasonably priced accommodations.
Telephone works.
Bathroom in really tiptop shape.
No drips, plenty of hot water and good, steady pressure.
That could be a side benefit of the waterfall outside my window.
Mattress firm, but not too firm.
And no lumps like that time I told you about down in El Paso.
What a nightmare that was.
But you've heard me tell that story once or twice, haven't you, Diane?
Haven't tried the television set yet.
Looks like cable, probably no reception problems.
But the true test of any hotel, as you well know, Diane, is that morning cup of coffee, which I'll be getting back to you about within a half hour.
Diane, it struck me again earlier this morning.
There are two things that continue to trouble me and I'm speaking now not only as an agent of the Bureau, but also as a human being.
What really went on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?
And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You know, this is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.
I've had I can't tell you how many cups of coffee in my life and this...
This is one of the best.
Now, I'd like two eggs, over hard.
I know, don't tell me, it's hard on the arteries.
But Old habits die hard.
Just about as hard as I want those eggs.
Bacon, super crispy, almost burned.
Cremate it.
That's great.
And I'll have the grapefruit juice.
Just as long as those grapefruits are freshly squeezed.
My name's Audrey Horne.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Can I sit here?
Well, Miss Horne, unless I miss my guess, your father is Benjamin Horne, the owner of this fine establishment.
So I imagine you can sit anywhere you'd like.
I'd also like to add it would be my pleasure.
Thank you.
You're here investigating the murder of Laura Palmer?
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?
Not exactly.
See, Laura tutored my older brother, Johnny, three times a week.
Johnny's 27 and he's in the third grade.
He's got emotional problems.
Runs in the family.
Do you like my ring?
Very nice.
You know, sometimes I get so flushed, it's interesting.
Do your palms ever itch?
COOPER:
Morning, deputy. 
Hey, Lucy.
ANDY [MUMBLES]:
Good morning, Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper, I got jelly for you special.
The sheriff's in the conference room.
It's the door across from the...
I'll look for him in the conference room.
Hey, three for three.
Sheriff, let's get James Hurley up from cell 4 and talk to him straight.
He was in love with Laura Palmer.
My bet is she told him whatever dirt she knew about Mike and Bobby and who knows what else.
Then let's have a little chat with those two perpetrators.
Let's run a top-to-bottom on Bobby's vehicle, see what that brings us.
Also check on the autopsy on Laura Palmer and see what that brings in.
We're also gonna wanna talk to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, let's give them a few days to deal with their grief.
I've got the rest of our day mapped out, let's meet back here in three minutes.
Harry, I really have to urinate.
Oh. 
By the way, coffee at the Great Northern?
Incredible.
[GULPS]
HAYWARD: 
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura.
I've known her all her life.
She was my daughter's best friend.
I couldn't bring myself to do the postmortem, so I called Joe Fielding in from Fairvale.
He did the work, I assisted.
Well, this is what he found.
Time of death estimated to be between midnight and 4 a.m.
What killed her is loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds, no single one serious enough to have caused death.
Bite marks on her shoulders, also on her tongue.
Probably self-inflicted.
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms, where she was bound.
We're waiting on the toxological tests for drug use.
Within the last 12 hours, she'd had sexual relations with at least three men.
You've examined Ronnette Pulaski as well?
Yes, sir.
There's no question in my mind.
The same perpetrator attacked both of them in that train car.
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronnette be able to talk to us?
She had a severe head injury, it's still early to tell.
Add to that the psychological impact of the fear,
probably witnessing what was happening to Laura before she...
So beautiful.
Who would do a thing like that?
SHELLY:
Leo.
[VACUUM WHIRRING]
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now and Norma should be here any sec.
Leo?
Did you finish cleaning my boots?
Yeah, I did them and I did the laundry too.
All Of it?
Well, yeah.
No, you didn't.
Okay, Leo, when I get home, I'll do it.
Now, Shelly.
Okay.
[GASPS]
Blood.
LEO:
Shelly? 
Norma's here.
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.
I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today.
Be a good girl and save me a piece of pie.
Sure, Leo.
James, you were placed under arrest for suspicion of murder.
The murder of Laura Palmer.
Now, you have no previous criminal record, is that correct?
None. 
No, sir.
Did you shoot this video?
That's your cycle, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
The three of us went up there two Sundays ago.
James, you were in love with Laura.
The two of you were seeing each other secretly.
No one else at school or any of her friends knew about it.
She was the homecoming queen, she was dating the captain of the football team.
How much longer did you think you could keep this relationship a secret?
Yeah, well, it was secret because that's the way she wanted it.
Why? 
Was she afraid of Bobby?
I think so.
Did you know she was using cocaine?
Yes.
Did you ever use cocaine with her?
No, I tried to get her to stop.
- And she did for a while.
- Why did she start using again?
Something happened a couple of days ago.
What? 
What happened?
I don't know.
I think something scared her because she wouldn't see me.
She wouldn't even talk to me.
[SIGHS]
When was the last time you saw her?
The night she died.
She snuck out of her house about 9:30.
About 12:30, I stopped the bike at the light at Sparkwood and 21.
And she jumped off and ran away.
I didn't see her again.
Did you and Laura have a fight?
Not exactly.
But she said she couldn't see me anymore.
Why?
She didn't say.
You recognize this necklace?
Yes, sir.
James, what happened on February 5th?
And who has the other half of this heart?
LAURA: 
James, guess why I'm so happy today.
JAMES: 
Because your skin is so soft and you smell so good?
- No.
- Why?
Because I really believe that you love me.
Now my heart belongs to you.
I don't know.
LEO:
Damn it.
Where's that shirt?
No!
Hey, Bopper.
Since when does Leo Johnson call me at my parents' house?
Leo called you?
Yeah, yesterday.
He was looking for you.
He wanted to know where the other half of the money was.
[SIGHS]
What did you tell him, Snake?
Well, as far as I knew, he didn't have any of it yet.
Because I thought the deal was we were supposed to give it to him today.
Yeah, well,
I gave him half already.
When did you see him?
- Hey, I saw him the other night, okay?
- What night?
The night Laura died.
I went to see Leo because I had this money burning a $10,000 hole in my pocket.
What about the other half?
- It's in Laura's safe-deposit box.
- So you didn't get it back from her?
She was supposed to hand it over today.
Then she went and checked out on us.
So how are we supposed to get 1O grand for Leo?
I don't know, Snake.
Maybe we could sell light bulbs door to door.
Oh, that's great, that's just-- That's just great.
- This isn't funny, Bobby.
- I'm not laughing.
We're lucky.
We're lucky we're in jail.
Because you know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out.
Shut up, man.
Don't mention one word about Leo Johnson.
You do not know Leo Johnson.
[DOOR OPENS]
LAURA:
Help me.
Mom.
Mom.
Hi, honey.
Mom, it's 10:30.
Why didn't you wake me?
I was supposed to go to the sheriff's office.
They called this morning and said they could wait until tomorrow to see you.
Your father and I thought you needed your rest.
You woke us crying in your sleep last night.
- Do you remember?
- No.
Really?
We feel so badly for you.
We're so sorry.
Mom, it's so strange.
I know I should be sad, and I am.
Part of me is.
But it's like...
It's like I'm having the most beautiful dream and the most terrible nightmare all at once.
Your father said you went out last night to meet a boy named James Hurley.
Does this have anything to do with him?
Can this be between you and me?
Of course it can.
James and Laura were seeing each other the last two months.
I was the only one who knew about it.
Mom, James was so good for her.
You don't know how troubled Laura was.
Last night, I had to see him.
We were the two closest people in the world to her.
But I feel so bad now.
Why. angel?
Because we realized that all this time we were the ones falling in love.
So I feel like I've betrayed my best friend.
And if it's true, then why am I so happy?
Oh, honey.
Now, you tell me what you wanna do.
Should we see these guys separately or together?
- No, no, we can see them together.
- Okay.
[COOPER CLEARS THROAT]
TRUMAN:
Hey, Ed.
- How's that coconut?
- Well, it's kind of tender.
But my pride hurts worse.
Ed, this is Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Pleasure.
- Any relation to James?
I'm his uncle and he works in my garage.
His mother's out of town and I look after him when she's away.
You fellas plan on holding him?
No, we can, uh, release him into your custody.
Well, let me understand.
ls James being charged?
Well, I had one small doubt which he cleared up for me.
He didn't kill anybody.
But you tell him to be careful because we're gonna have to release Mike and Bobby today as well.
- Will do.
- Agent Cooper,
I've got a call for you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield.
Sounds like long distance.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
It has that open air sound, you know, where it sounds like wind blowing?
- Like wind blowing through trees.
- Yes, Albert.
Harry, I've been thinking about last night at the Roadhouse.
And something's not right.
Yeah, when I first saw that bandage,
I thought maybe old Nadine caught wind of you and Norma.
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me and Norma,
I'd be playing harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.
Ain't that the truth?
I was there seeing Norma, but I was also on my stakeout.
And I can remember Mike and Bobby grabbing Donna and I got up to walk over and I got all lightheaded.
I was out on my feet before I got there.
I don't even remember getting hit.
What do you mean you don't remember?
Well, I'm pretty sure my beer was drugged.
Jacques Renault was tending bar.
[TRUMAN SIGHS]
All right, Albert, bring the boys.
You can have the body all day tomorrow.
N0, I can't do it, they're gonna put her in the ground on Monday.
Albert, listen.
If you come up through Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.
The Lamplighter Inn.
They got a cherry pie there that'll kill you.
[TRAIN WHISTLE WAILING] [BELL DINGING]
- Hi, Nadine.
- What are you doing here, Norma?
I might ask you the same question.
And I will tell you.
I've gotten all new drapes for my house.
Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentleman Jim's.
And we installed them together.
They're a beige sheer.
I was up all last night.
Do you know what I was doing?
No, I don't.
I was inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner.
And do you know how it works?
Do you know what makes it work?
The thing I thought of at 4 this morning when I was waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?
Cotton balls.
By God, those things will be quiet now.
Did you have to post bail?
No, I had a talk with Harry.
There's no charge.
Mom still out of town?
Yeah, she's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.
Gonna need a hand from the Bookhouse Boys.
- Somebody's gotta watch my back.
- Already got it covered.
Hi, Mike.
Bobby.
Well, before we get started, have you two fellas got your stories straight?
If we tell the truth, we don't have to get our stories straight.
Besides, the sheriff told us we're just in here for fighting.
And, uh, it was self-defense.
Right.
Well, I guess you can go, then.
- Now?
COOPER: 
Mm-hm.
[WHISTLE TOOTS]
Oh, fellas, one more thing.
Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley because if anything happens to him, we're coming for you.
Sheriff, what are you sitting around for?
We got places to go and people to see.
Yeah, I think I better start studying medicine.
Why's that?
Because I'm beginning to feel a bit like Dr. Watson.
On top of the morning to you, Pete.
Uh, no, Josie, the expression is "top of the morning."
And it's just barely morning.
Pete,
I want to thank you for yesterday.
For standing up to rne with Catherine.
Forget it.
Catherine was wrong yesterday.
- Period.
- Well, thank you anyway.
[INTERCOM BUZZES]
- Hello.
TRUMAN: 
Pete, it's Harry.
I got Agent Cooper with me.
We're here to see Mrs. Packard.
Um, I will make a fresh pot of coffee.
[FOOTSTEPS]
- Hi, sheriff.
- Mrs. Packard.
Dale Cooper, FBI.
You remember him from the town meeting last night, I'm sure.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Agent Cooper, you remember Pete Martell.
- Sure, Pete.
- You bet.
Uh, can we offer you gentlemen a cup of joe?
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic word.
- I'd love a cup, thanks.
- Sure, I'll pour that for you.
Uh, Mr. Cooper, uh, how do you take it?
Black as midnight on a moonless night.
Pretty black.
- Um, please sit down.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Packard, I'll come straight to the point.
Mrs. Packard, I understand that you hired Laura Palmer to come visit you twice a week to help you with your English, is that correct?
Yes.
When was the last time that you saw her?
Thursday afternoon, about the time the mill blew 5.
- That would be 5:00?
- Yes.
And when did she leave?
In an hour, when the lesson was finished.
I didn't see her again.
How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon?
Something was bothering her.
But we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it.
Something she said though, that stuck on my mind.
She said,
"I think now I understand how you feel about your husband's death."
Did she say what that was in reference to?
No.
But after what happened to her, I can't help hearing it in my head.
Like some haunting melody.
TRUMAN:
Hmm.
[PHONE RINGING]
- Excuse me.
COOPER: 
Certainly.
So, Harry, how long you been seeing her?
How did you know?
Body language.
Jeez Louise.
Not long. 
Six weeks.
Andrew died a year and a half ago.
Fellas, don't drink that coffee.
You'd never guess.
There was a fish in the percolator.
Sorry.
[TRUMAN CLEARS THROAT]
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.
I just thought you ought to know what your sentimental, goodwill shenanigans cost us yesterday.
You do know what shenanigans are, don't you?
Shutting down the mill cost us $87,000 and change.
You really think that would have made brother Andrew happy.
[SIGHS]
Jocelyn? 
Mrs. Packard?
Uh, what is "shenanigans?"
Nonsense, mischief, often a deceitful or treacherous trick.
Why do you always have to rush off?
It's been over an hour.
I remember there was a time when we used to take the whole afternoon.
In the sweetness of passing time, this hour will soon seem like a day.
Sing it to somebody else.
I'm no peabrain chambermaid looking for a tumble in the broom closet.
I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities.
Oh, no. 
My mistake.
I'd gotten used to our conducting business and pleasure.
Sweetheart, it's all the same to me.
Don't "sweetheart" me, you old dog.
I'm no schoolgirl either.
What's the next step?
Do we escalate?
We may not have to do anything.
A few more, uh, local tragedies and Josie might just run the old mill into the ground all by herself.
The rate we're going, it's gonna be years before the mill's bankrupt.
I don't wanna wait any longer.
Besides, my knothead husband may peek in the ledger and sniff out the creative arithmetic.
Maybe it's time to, uh, start a little fire.
Are you talking about business or pleasure?
I'm talking about the Packard sawmill.
All that dry timber lying around.
A stray spark.
One night.
Some night when Pete's off on a toot with Smokey the Bear.
Now I remember how all those hours turned into days.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
Sarah, darling.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart, but, uh, Donna Hayward is here.
Take this now.
I'll send her in.
- Try not to upset her.
- Okay.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I miss her so much.
Do you miss her?
Yes, I miss her so much.
[SOBBING]
I miss her so much.
I miss her so much.
I miss her so much.
[GASPS]
Laura.
Oh, Laura, my baby.
Oh, Laura, my baby.
Oh. 
Oh.
[GASPING]
[SCREAMING]
Leland, Leland.
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
So neither of you saw Ronnette after school that day?
That's right.
And as far as you know, she went to her after-school job?
Yes, Home's Department Store downtown.
What did she do at the department store?
She was, uh, a salesgirl.
At perfume counter.
She used to joke it was the sweetest smelling job she'd ever had.
Excuse me.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES NEARBY]
[SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
How many times have I asked you not to disturb the guests with this racket?
About 4000.
Audrey,
Julie tells me that, uh, you were in with the Norwegians just before they all suddenly decided, en masse, to return to the old country without signing the contracts.
Is that true?
- Yes.
- Ah.
You wouldn't have, uh, done or said anything that, uh, might have precipitated their evacuation, would you?
I mean, I'm assuming that this was just a coincidence.
- Huh?
- Daddy.
I did go in there to check out that ridiculous smorgasbord.
And while I was in there, I happened to mention that I was sad.
About what?
About my dear, close friend Laura being brutally murdered.
Do you realize the kind of money that your little performance just cost this family?
If you ever pull another stunt like that, you are going to be scrubbing bidets in a Bulgarian convent.
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.
Laura died two days ago.
I lost you years ago.
For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Robert, uh, I was hoping we'd have the chance to discuss the events of the past few days.
Not necessarily the physical events themselves, but rather, the thoughts and feelings surrounding it.
[SIGHS]
Rebellion in a young man your age is a necessary fact of life.
Candidly, a sign of strength.
In other words, Robert,
I respect your rebellious nature.
However, being your father,
I am obligated to contain that fire of contrariness within the bounds established by society as well as those within our own family structure.
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter into a dialogue with me, your father.
There are times when silence is golden.
Silence can be taken many ways, as a sign of intelligence.
The quieter we become, the more we hear.
BOBBY:
Ah!
Now, I am a tolerant man.
My patience has its limits.
To have his path made clear is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.
Robert, you and I are going to work to make yours real clear.
We're here for you, Bobby.
Can I get you anything to go with that, sheriff?
Agent Cooper here might wanna try a slice of that pie.
- Cherry pie?
- Best in the tri-counties.
COOPER:
Hmm.
And could you ask Norma to stop by a second, Shelly?
- Sure thing.
- Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.
Man, I still can't get the taste of that fish-filtered coffee
- out of my mouth.
- Me neither.
- That's Shelly Johnson, with a J?
- Mm-hm.
Husband's a trucker, Leo.
Minor rap sheet.
Log Lady?
TRUMAN: 
Right.
- Hi.
Can I ask her about her log?
Many have.
Evening, Harry.
Norma, like to have you meet Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Norma Jennings.
Miss Jennings, is it true that Laura used to help you with the Meals on Wheels program, delivering hot dinners to elderly shut-ins?
Yeah, Laura helped organize that program.
Do you have the names of the people on her route?
- I can get them for you.
- Mm. 
Would you, please?
And, uh, two more pieces of this incredible pie.
Okay.
Man, oh, man, you must have the metabolism of a bumblebee.
[TRUMAN CHUCKLES]
For your information,
I heard you speaking about Laura Palmer.
Yes.
One day, my log will have something to say about this.
My log saw something that night.
Really? 
What did it See?
Ask it.
I thought so.
[DOOR OPENS]
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
SHELLY:
Thanks, Norma. 
See you tomorrow.
Hi, Leo.
Brought you some pie.
Where's my shirt?
What shirt?
My favorite blue shirt.
It's the second one you lost this year.
I'm gonna teach you a lesson now, Shelly, about taking care of my property.
That means making sure things aren't lost or damaged.
[WHIMPERING] Oh, God, please, Leo.
- This is gonna hurt you.
- No.
[OLDIES ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO]
No!
[DOORBELL RINGS]
I'll get it.
Come on.
Uh, Mom, Dad, this is James.
James Hurley.
- How do you do, James?
- Nice to see you, sir, Mrs. Hayward.
Very nice to meet you, James.
Well, I hope you're hungry.
- Eileen's been cooking up a storm.
- Yes, sir.
Would you like something to drink?
We have some soft drinks and some fruit punch, some sparkling cider.
Uh, fruit punch.
That'd be good, thank you.
- I'll get it.
- Okay.
Uh, why don't you fellas sit down at the table and I'll go check on the roast.
- Here's your fruit punch.
- Thanks, Donna.
I don't believe I know your parents, James.
No, sir. 
My dad died when I was 10 and my mom travels a lot.
- She writes for the paper sometimes.
- Oh.
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm is James' uncle.
His, uh, wife's the lady with the patch.
Yes, sir, that's my Aunt Nadine.
She's a real character.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
EILEEN: 
Will? 
Could you come give me a hand, please?
Uh, excuse me.
We can talk after dinner.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
That bastard.
First your girlfriend, then mine.
Too bad we can only kill him once.
LAURA [ON RECORDING]:
Hey, what's up, doc?
It's Laura Palmer in case you haven't guessed.
I'm making you another one of these tapes, which, as you already know,
I've mailed to you in one of the envelopes you gave me.
It's Thursday the 23rd and I'm so bored.
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.
[WHIMPERING] God, James is sweet, but he's so dumb.
I should have met you a long time ago, Dr. Jacoby, because right now, I can take just so much of sweet.
I just know I'm gonna get lost in those woods again tonight.
I just know it.
Remember me telling you about that mystery man?
Well...
[SOBBING]

We'll talk later.
Albert, if you come up to Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.
- Leo called you?
- He asked for the rest of the money.
She was supposed to hand it over today. 
She checked out on us.
We're lucky we're in jail.
You know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out.
No!
No!
No, no, no, not in my room.
In here, in here!
- Jerry, back from Paris?
- Ben, what a nightmare!
Right there! 
No, right there.
What is with you guys?
I've got a sandwich in there, I want all those bags open.
We're looking till we find it...
Hey, Audrey, Uncle Jerry's back.
- Sylvia...
- Benjamin!
OK, OK... 
Gone! 
Goodbye!
Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate.
It's a baguette with brie and butter.
I had four of these every day I was there.
You've got to try this thing.
Here, go ahead, eat it. 
Go ahead.
Go ahead!
Oh, yeah.
This is incredible, Jer!
You know what this reminds us of?
You know who likes this?
It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny down by the river.
- My God, you're right!
- Am I right? 
Am I right?
Oh, no wonder!
Jer, outside, outside.
Always a pleasure.
Jerry...
Leland's daughter was murdered, and the Norwegians left.
- Did they sign?
- Deal's off.
We had those Vikings by the horns!
What happened?
We're not a hundred percent sure, they took their translator with them.
Did you say Leland's daughter was murdered?
Yes.
I'm depressed.
I can fix that.
There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jacks, freshly scented from the perfume counter.
And you, brother Jer, have a 50-50 chance of being first in line.
I like those odds.
All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys.
- That's right.
- Let's jump in the boat.
That's great huckleberry pie, Mrs Hayward.
Thank you, James.
Well... 
Mrs Hayward and I are going to say good night, James.
- Good night, James.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mom.
Don't worry about the dishes, I'll clean up.
Are you coming to church with us in the morning, Donna?
Yes.
- Nine o'clock sharp.
- OK.
- Good night, James.
- Good night, sir.
Hi, sailor!
Good evening, Mr Horne.
Ben, we're not gonna go in the casino first?
Jer, I didn't come here to lose my shirt, I just came to take it off.
- Kim, the Horne brothers are here.
- I'll tell Blackie.
I'd like to order two drinks.
One double scotch on the rocks.
And my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks.
That's two double scotch on the rocks.
Next stop, rocket science.
Jerry...
- Blackie!
- Benjamin.
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
"Thou art more lovely and more temperate
"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
"And every fair from fair sometimes declines
"By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade
"Nor lose possession of that fair thouowest
- "Nor shall death brag..." 
- Where's the new girl?
When you really want love, you'll find it waiting for you.
Heads.
Come on. 
We'll take care of you, Jerry.
Well...
Donna, I don't think that what we're feeling or doing is wrong.
Why not?
Because it's the truth.
Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway.
You do?
Yes. 
I remember a time in school, in the hall.
We were suddenly alone, and we looked at each other.
I almost told you I loved you then.
It's true.
It is true, isn't it?
Oh, James. 
I guess because of Laura I couldn't say anything.
- I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me, too.
Are we gonna be together, James?
Are we?
Are we, James?
- Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Hello, it's Hawk.
Deputy Hawk, how is Ronnette Pulaski?
- Body and spirit are still far apart.
- What did you find out?
Ronnette recently quit at the perfume counter of Horne's store.
Everything else is quiet, ex cept there was... a one-armed man snooping around intensive care.
- A one-armed man?
- Left.
- Did you question him?
- No. 
I pursued, but he got away.
Maintain an around-the-clock watch on Ronnette. 
We'll speak in the morning.
Got it?
Supposed to leave it in this stupid football.
Is it in there?
Not all of it.
Cash on delivery, Bobby.
He's got a gun.
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey.
Who's that?
- Is someone with you?
- Never mind.
Toss it over here, quarterback.
It's empty.
Weren't you supposed to leave something for me?
This barely covers what we paid for.
Where's the rest?
- Where's the rest of the money?
- There's a...
- There's a problem.
- Problem?
- Laura had it.
- You think you got problems?
We can get it.
Wait until everything settles down.
You punks owe me ten grand.
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.
OK. 
We won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.
- Do I look like a bank?
- I appreciate your position.
How could I anticipate this thing with Laura?
Laura was a wild girl.
Tell me about it.
Maybe. 
Someday.
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.
- What is your problem, Leo?
- Problem?
You want to know about problems?
OK.
You're on the road, driving back and forth, gone for days.
- You get back, and guess what?
- What?
You find out your old lady's been giving it away.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Stepping out in your own damn bedroom. 
That's a problem.
I guess so. 
I guess it is.
- Do You know who?
- A man needs a clean house.
Sure. 
So do You know who?
- I'll take care of it.
- Sure.
And this other thing, we'll take care of it, don't worry.
We'll get the cash, and everything will be square.
- Go out for a pass.
- What?
- Go out for a pass.
- OK, just...
- Run.
- Take it easy.
Run! 
Run!
Damn it, I'm done, Bobby.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Ed!
- Sorry, I didn't see it.
Youstepped on my drape runner!
- It was in the middle of the floor.
- Think that's an accident?
I laid those out there myself. 
I was up all night working on that invention.
- I'm real sorry, Nadine.
- Ed, you make me sick!
That's it! 
Exactly sixty feet, six inches.
It's perfect.
What do you think he's up to?
It beats me.
Invitation to love.
Each day brings a new beginning, and every hour holds the promise of an invitation to love.
Right.
- Who is it?
- The big, bad bobcat.
Are you crazy?
What are You doing here?
I just passed Leo out in North Bend.
- We've got at least twenty minutes.
- Where's your car?
Parked in the woods. 
Open Sesame!
Somebody might see me out here, and that'd be worse.
Bobby, you cannot come by here like this.
We can't meet, for a while.
What the hell happened to you?
Leo Johnson happened to me.
That bastard. 
Come here.
Bobby! 
If he finds out about us, he's gonna kill you.
He'll kill us both.
If he ever does this to you again, I'll kill him.
I mean it.
Cup of coffee.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last, but I'm in that doghouse again.
What happened this time?
I popped a grease gun, stepped on a drape runner, and all hell broke loose.
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store.
All she talked about is the drape runners.
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.
Bobby sure gave me a good one?
- Where do you want these rocks?
- There by the doughnuts, Deputy.
- Anyone for a warm-up?
- Oh, yeah!
- You bet!
- Thanks, Lucy.
Damn good coffee!
And hot!
Would everyone please take a seat?
By way of explaining what we're about to do,
I am first gonna tell you a little bit about the country called...
Tibet.
An extremely spiritual country, the leader of Tibet is known as the Dalai Lama.
In 1950, communist China invaded Tibet.
While leaving the Dalai Lama in charge, they seized control of the country.
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama fled to India and has lived in exile ever since.
Following a dream three years ago,
I have become moved by the plight of the Tibetans and filled with a desire to help them.
I awoke realising I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand in hand with the deepest level of intuition.
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me, I will now demonstrate.
On the day of her death
Laura Palmer wrote the following in her diary,
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight." Today we'll concentrate on the "J's".
Harry, when I give the word, would you read aloud each name I've written on the blackboard?
Deputy Hawk, stand here and hold this bucket of rocks where I can get to them.
Would you please put on the kitchen mittens.
Deputy Andy, move down, stand by the bottle.
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.
Not too near, Andy!
I'm getting ex cited.
If I hit the bottle after a particular name, make a check on the name.
Sheriff, when you say the name, state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer.
- Ready?
- Ready.
James Hurley...secret boyfriend.
James Hurley.
Josie Packard...was instructed in English by Laura.
Josie Packard.
So there's no check next to either of these names?
That's correct. 
Please continue.
Dr Lawrence Jacoby...
Laura's psychiatrist.
Dr Lawrence Jacoby.
You did it! 
You hit it!
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck, but did not break.
Very important.
Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was!
Johnny Horne. 
Laura was his special education tutor.
Johnny Horne.
Norma Jennings...helped Laura with the meals-on-wheels programme.
Norma Jennings.
Shelly Johnson...
waitress at diner, friend.
Shelly Johnson.
- Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?
It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt a bit.
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.
Coop...
Tell me...
The idea for all this really came from a dream?
Yes. 
It did.
Jack with One Eye...
Maybe it's the letter 'i', but there's no 'i' in Jack.
I think it means he only had one eye.
Sounds like Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.
No, there's a casino up north called One-Eyed Jacks, across the border in Canada.
We're gonna have to check that place out.
I'm going to erase this, because it's a place, not a person.
Maybe the person could be in the place.
- So should I erase it?
- Yes.
Yes, a person could be in a place, or yes, I should erase it?
Erase it, Lucy. 
Next name, Harry.
Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck, connection with Laura...unknown.
Leo Johnson.
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.
- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma. 
A cup of coffee, please.
Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go say hi.
Hi.
Hi, Donna.
So my parents said they saw you at church today. 
I didn't see you.
I came by because of Laura.
What do you mean?
I didn't think you liked her.
There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did take care of my brother Johnny.
I loved her for that.
Do you like coffee?
Yeah, with cream and sugar.
Agent Cooper loves coffee.
Audrey!
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Did Laura ever talk about my father?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
No, what do you mean?
He used to sing to her.
I love this music.
Isn't it too dreamy?
Hawk found this half a mile down the tracks from the crime site.
It's a nasty piece of work.
Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.
- Albert?
- A-l-b-e-r-t.
- Do we have to stand here all day?
- No.
Albert Rosenfield.
R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d.
Sheriff, this is Lucy.
- Is Agent Cooper with you?
- Yes, he is.
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?
- Yes, he is...they are.
- We're on our way.
- Agent Cooper will be right with you.
- I can hear perfectly well, Curly.
Albert and his team are cream of the crop. 
Albert's a forensics genius.
I wouldn't expect anything less.
But I got to warn you, Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.
- Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?
What kind of a two-bit operation are they running here?
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.
I've seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.
What are you waiting for? 
Christmas?
They're burying this girl tomorrow, and we've wasted half the day getting here.
I suggest you and your team should get started.
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.
Results from the local pathologist's report.
Welcome to Amateur Hour.
Looks like an all-nighter, boys.
Albert, got a minute?
I hear that you're real good at what You do.
- That's correct.
- That's good.
'Cause normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on Queer Street.
Good night, Ed!
- Ed, is that you?
- Yeah, honey, it's me.
- Ed!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.
Why's that?
You don't know what you've done for me.
- No, I don't.
- Oh, Ed, you big lug!
When you tracked that grease into the house today, you spilled some on my cotton balls.
But instead of tossing them out, I put the greased ones on the runners.
And Ed...just listen to this.
Completely silent.
- How about that?
- Oh, Ed...
We're gonna be so rich!
Everything smells like fish around here.
Well, you could wash your socks separately.
What did that FBI man want up here today?
Very nice fellow.
Asked a few questions.
About what?
Well, he talked to Josie mostly.
I had a problem with a fish.
Took a liking to my percolator.
What did he want to talk to Josie about?
Why don't you ask her?
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.
- Thank you.
- You betcha.
Didn't he ask for me?
Yeah, but we said You were on a world tour he should contact your press agent.
Get your boots off my bed and go to your room!
I didn't want to get mink oil on my bedspread.
You got mink oil in your head.
Two books.
Leland...
- Leland, stop it!
- We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance for Laura.
- Leland, stop it! 
Give it to me.
- We have to dance!
Leland! 
Leland, give it to me!
What is going on?
Leland! 
What is going on in this house?
Oh, God!
Laura, Laura!
Laura!
"Through the darkness of future past,
"the magician longs to see,
"one chance out between two worlds...
"fire, walk with me."
We lived among the people.
I think you say, convenience store.
We lived above it.
I mean it like it is, like it sounds.
I, too, have been touched by the devilish one.
Tattoo on the left shoulder.
Oh, but when I saw the face of God,
I was changed.
I took the entire arm off.
My name is Mike. 
His name is Bob.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear me?
"Catch you with my Death Bag."
You may think I've gone insane.
But I promise...
I will kill again!
But it...it is Laura Palmer.
Are you Laura Palmer?
Harry, it's Cooper.
Meet me for breakfast, 7:00 am the hotel lobby.
I know who killed Laura Palmer.
No, it can wait till morning.

Previously...
We'll talk later.
Albert, if you come up to Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.
- Leo called you?
- He asked for the rest of the money.
She was supposed to hand it over today. 
She checked out on us.
We're lucky we're in jail.
You know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out.

No, no, no, not in my room.

- I couldn't even let myself think it.
- Me, too.
Are we gonna be together, James?
Are we?
Are we, James?
- Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Hello, it's Hawk.
Deputy Hawk, how is Ronnette Pulaski?
- Body and spirit are still far apart.
- What did you find out?
Ronnette recently quit at the perfume counter of Horne's store.
Everything else is quiet, except there was... a one-armed man snooping around intensive care.
- A one-armed man?
- Left.
- Did you question him?
- No. 
I pursued, but he got away.
Maintain an around-the-clock watch on Ronnette. 
We'll speak in the morning.
Got it?
Supposed to leave it in this stupid football.
Is it in there?
Not all of it.
Cash on delivery, Bobby.
He's got a gun.
- Hey, Leo.
- Hey.
Who's that?
- Is someone with you?
- Never mind.
Toss it over here, quarterback.
It's empty.
Weren't you supposed to leave something for me?
This barely covers what we paid for.
Where's the rest?
- Where's the rest of the money?
- There's a...
- There's a problem.
- Problem?
- Laura had it.
- You think you got problems?
We can get it.
Wait until everything settles down.
You punks owe me ten grand.
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.
OK. 
We won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.
- Do I look like a bank?
- I appreciate your position.
How could I anticipate this thing with Laura?
Laura was a wild girl.
Tell me about it.
Maybe. 
Someday.
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.
- What is your problem, Leo?
- Problem?
You want to know about problems?
OK.
You 're on the road, driving back and forth, gone for days.
- You get back, and guess what?
- What?
You find out your old lady's been giving it away.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Stepping out in your own damn bedroom. 
That's a problem.
I guess so. 
I guess it is.
- Do you know who?
- A man needs a clean house.
Sure. 
So do you know who?
- I'll take care of it.
- Sure.
And this other thing, we'll take care of it, don't worry.
We'll get the cash, and everything will be square.
- Go out for a pass.
- What?
- Go out for a pass.
- OK, just...
- Run.
- Take it easy.
Run! 
Run!
Damn it, I'm done, Bobby.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Ed!
- Sorry, I didn't see it.
You stepped on my drape runner!
- It was in the middle of the floor.
- Think that's an accident?
I laid those out there myself. 
I was up all night working on that invention.
I'm going to have the world's first 100% quiet runner!
- I'm real sorry, Nadine.
- Ed, you make me sick!
That's it! 
Exactly sixty feet, six inches.
It's perfect.
What do you think he's up to?
It beats me.
Invitation to love.
Each day brings a new beginning, and every hour holds the promise of an invitation to love.
Right.
- Who is it?
- The big, bad bobcat.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?
I just passed Leo out in North Bend.
- We've got at least twenty minutes.
- Where's your car?
Parked in the woods. 
Open Sesame!
Somebody might see me out here, and that'd be worse.
Bobby, you cannot come by here like this.
We can't meet, for a while.
What the hell happened to you?
Leo Johnson happened to me.
That bastard. 
Come here.
Bobby! 
If he finds out about us, he's gonna kill you.
He'll kill us both.
If he ever does this to you again, I'll kill him.
I mean it.
Cup of coffee.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last, but I'm in that doghouse again.
What happened this time?
I popped a grease gun, stepped on a drape runner, and all hell broke loose.
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store.
All she talked about is the drape runners.
She's got one big bee in her bonnet.
Bobby sure gave me a good one?
- Where do you want these rocks?
- There by the doughnuts, Deputy.
- Anyone for a warm-up?
- Oh, yeah!
- You bet!
- Thanks, Lucy.
Damn good coffee!
And hot!
Would everyone please take a seat?
By way of explaining what we're about to do,
I am first gonna tell you a little bit about the country called...
Tibet.
An extremely spiritual country, the leader of Tibet is known as the Dalai Lama.
In 1950, communist China invaded Tibet.
While leaving the Dalai Lama in charge, they seized control of the country.
In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama fled to India and has lived in exile ever since.
Following a dream three years ago,
I have become moved by the plight of the Tibetans and filled with a desire to help them.
I awoke realising I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand in hand with the deepest level of intuition.
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me, I will now demonstrate.
On the day of her death
Laura Palmer wrote the following in her diary,
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight." Today we'll concentrate on the "J's".
Harry, when I give the word, would you read aloud each name I've written on the blackboard?
Deputy Hawk, stand here and hold this bucket of rocks where I can get to them.
Would you please put on the kitchen mittens.
Deputy Andy, move down, stand by the bottle.
Lucy, take this piece of chalk.
Not too near, Andy!
I'm getting excited.
If I hit the bottle after a particular name, make a check on the name.
Sheriff, when you say the name, state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer.
- Ready?
- Ready.
James Hurley... secret boyfriend.
James Hurley.
Josie Packard... was instructed in English by Laura.
Josie Packard.
So there's no check next to either of these names?
That's correct. 
Please continue.
Dr Lawrence Jacoby...
Laura's psychiatrist.
Dr Lawrence Jacoby.
You did it! 
You hit it!
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck, but did not break.
Very important.
Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was!
Johnny Horne. 
Laura was his special education tutor.
Johnny Horne.
Norma Jennings... helped Laura with the meals-on-wheels programme.
Norma Jennings.
Shelly Johnson...
waitress at diner, friend.
Shelly Johnson.
- Sorry, Andy.
- Sweetie?
It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt a bit.
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.
Coop...
Tell me...
The idea for all this really came from a dream?
Yes. 
It did.
Jack with One Eye...
Maybe it's the letter 'i', but there's no 'i' in Jack.
I think it means he only had one eye.
Sounds like Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.
No, there's a casino up north called One-Eyed Jacks, across the border in Canada.
We're gonna have to check that place out.
I'm going to erase this, because it's a place, not a person.
Maybe the person could be in the place.
- So should I erase it?
- Yes.
Yes, a person could be in a place, or yes, I should erase it?
Erase it, Lucy. 
Next name, Harry.
Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck, connection with Laura... unknown.
Leo Johnson.
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.
Yeah, I saw her at church.
Wonder what she's doing down here.
- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi, Norma. 
A cup of coffee, please.
Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go say hi.
Hi.
Hi, Donna.
So my parents said they saw you at church today. 
I didn't see you.
I came by because of Laura.
What do you mean?
I didn't think you liked her.
There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did take care of my brother Johnny.
I loved her for that.
Do you like coffee?
Yeah, with cream and sugar.
Agent Cooper loves coffee.
Audrey!
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Did Laura ever talk about my father?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
No, what do you mean?
He used to sing to her.
I love this music.
Isn't it too dreamy?
Hawk found this half a mile down the tracks from the crime site.
It's a nasty piece of work.
Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.
- Albert?
- A-l-b-e-r-t.
- Do we have to stand here all day?
- No.
Albert Rosenfield.
R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d.
Sheriff, this is Lucy.
- Is Agent Cooper with you?
- Yes, he is.
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?
- Yes, he is... they are.
- We're on our way.
- Agent Cooper will be right with you.
- I can hear perfectly well, Curly.
Albert and his team are cream of the crop. 
Albert's a forensics genius.
I wouldn't expect anything less.
But I got to warn you, Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.
- Nobody's perfect.
- Isn't that the truth?
What kind of a two-bit operation are they running here?
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.
I've seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.
What are you waiting for? 
Christmas?
They're burying this girl tomorrow, and we've wasted half the day getting here.
I suggest you and your team should get started.
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.
Results from the local pathologist's report.
Welcome to Amateur Hour.
Looks like an all-nighter, boys.
Albert, got a minute?
I hear that you 're real good at what you do.
- That's correct.
- That's good.
'Cause normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on Queer Street.
Good night, Ed!
- Ed, is that you?
- Yeah, honey, it's me.
- Ed!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.
Why's that?
You don't know what you 've done for me.
- No, I don't.
- Oh, Ed, you big lug!
When you tracked that grease into the house today, you spilled some on my cotton balls.
But instead of tossing them out, I put the greased ones on the runners.
And Ed... just listen to this.
Completely silent.
- How about that?
- Oh, Ed...
We're gonna be so rich!
Everything smells like fish around here.
Well, you could wash your socks separately.
What did that FBI man want up here today?
Very nice fellow.
Asked a few questions.
About what?
Well, he talked to Josie mostly.
I had a problem with a fish.
Took a liking to my percolator.
What did he want to talk to Josie about?
Why don't you ask her?
Here's the key, the ledger's inside.
- Thank you.
- You betcha.
Didn't he ask for me?
Yeah, but we said you were on a world tour he should contact your press agent.
Get your boots off my bed and go to your room!
I didn't want to get mink oil on my bedspread.
You got mink oil in your head.
Two books.
Leland...
- Leland, stop it!
- We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance for Laura.
- Leland, stop it! 
Give it to me.
- We have to dance!
Leland! 
Leland, give it to me!
What is going on?
Leland! 
What is going on in this house?
Oh, God!
Laura, Laura!
Laura!
"Through the darkness of future past,
"the magician longs to see,
"one chance out between two worlds...
"fire, walk with me."
We lived among the people.
I think you say, convenience store.
We lived above it.
I mean it like it is, like it sounds.
I, too, have been touched by the devilish one.
Tattoo on the left shoulder.
Oh, but when I saw the face of God,
I was changed.
I took the entire arm off.
My name is Mike. 
His name is Bob.
Mike?
Mike, can you hear me?
"Catch you with my Death Bag."
You may think I've gone insane.
But I promise...
I will kill again!
But it... it is Laura Palmer.
Are you Laura Palmer?
Harry, it's Cooper.
Meet me for breakfast, 7:00 am the hotel lobby.
I know who killed Laura Palmer.
No, it can wait till morning.

They're burying this girl tomorrow, and we've wasted half the day getting here.
Dr Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.
Laura was a patient of mine.
Youpunks owe me ten grand.
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter into a dialogue with me, your father.
Here's the key. 
The ledger's inside.
Two books...
When youleast expect it...
We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance... 
For Laura.
Leland! 
Leland! 
Give it to me!
Harry? 
It's Cooper.
Meet me for breakfast, 7:00 am, the hotel lobby.
I know who killed Laura Palmer.
Diane, 7:15 am. 
I'll be heading for the Sheriff's after breakfast.
From there we'll be going on to Laura Palmer's funeral.
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.
Just Agent, Audrey. 
Special Agent.
Special Agent.
Would youcare to join me for breakfast?
- I'm in a hurry.
- For what?
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing is incredible.
- Do youreally think so?
- Yes, I do. 
Please, have a seat.
And would youwrite your name down for me? 
Here.
OK.
Audrey, there's something you'd like to tell me.
There is?
Youslipped this note underneath my door the night before last.
I did?
I wanted to help you. 
For Laura.
Yousaid youand Laura weren't exactly friends.
We weren't friends, but I understood her better than the rest.
- What is "One-Eyed Jacks?" 
- It's a place up north.
- Men go there.
- What about women?
Women...youknow, work there.
Did Laura work there?
I don't know. 
Laura worked at my father's department store.
- Horne's?
- He named it after himself.
Where at Horne's department store?
At the perfume counter.
- So did Ronnette Pulaski.
- Really?
The rightward slant in your handwriting indicates a romantic nature.
A heart that yearns. 
Be careful.
I do?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now. 
Police business.
Thank youfor talking to me.
Trudy, two more coffees, please.
Harry, Lucy...
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.
Griddlecakes, melted butter, maple syrup, lightly heated, slice of ham.
Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup collides with ham.
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.
Who killed Laura Palmer?
Let me tell youabout the dream I had last night.
- Tibet?
- No.
Youwere there. 
Lucy, so were you.
Harry, my dream is a code waiting to be broken.
Break the code, solve the crime.
"Break the code, solve the crime."
In my dream, Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer.
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.
I got a phone call from a one-armed man named Mike.
- The killer's name was Bob.
- Mike and Bobby?
No, it's a different Mike and a different Bob.
They lived above a convenience store.
They had a tattoo, "Fire, walk with me".
Mike couldn't stand the killing any more, so he cut off his arm.
Bob vowed to kill again, so Mike shot him.
Do youknow where dreams come from?
- Not specifically.
- No.
Acetylcholine neurons fire high-voltage impulses into the forebrain.
These impulses become pictures, the pictures become dreams, but... no one knows why we choose these particular pictures.
So what was the end of this dream?
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.
I was old, sitting in a red room.
There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman.
The midget told me that my favourite gum was coming back into style, and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer, which she did.
- What cousin?
- The beautiful woman.
She's filled with secrets.
Sometimes her arms bend back.
Where she's from, the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air.
The midget did a dance.
Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.
- Who was it?
- I don't remember.
- Damn!
- Damn!
Harry, our job is simple:
break the code, solve the crime.
Yeah?
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue and there's a big fight going on.
Youhang on, I'll be right there.
That was Andy.
There's a fight over at the morgue.
Albert.
You're the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen.
I've never known such little regard for human frailty. 
Have youno compassion?
I've got compassion running out of my nose. 
I'm the Sultan of Sentiment.
Doctor Hayward, I have travelled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sinkhole to perform a series of tests.
I do not ask youto understand these tests. 
I'm not cruel.
I just ask youto get out, so I can finish my work!
We are here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.
If youthink we're gonna leave without her, youare crazy!
All right, all right, all right!
Mr Rosenfield, please.
Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today, but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included, when I say that we appreciate and understand the value of your work.
But, as their representative, I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well.
Mr Horne, I realise that your position in this fair community pretty well guarantees venality, insincerity and a rather irritating method of expressing yourself.
Stupidity, however, is not a necessarily inherent trait.
Therefore, please listen closely.
Youcan have a funeral any old time.
Youdig a hole, youplant a coffin.
I, however, cannot perform these tests next year, next month, next week or tomorrow.
I must perform them now.
I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do, so please, why don't youreturn to your porch rockers and resume whittling?
That does it. 
I'm taking charge of the body and youdon't touch Laura...
What the hell do youthink you're doing?
!
- Gentlemen.
- What's going on?
Thank God!
This old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. 
Cuff him!
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. 
He's not human.
- What's the hold-up?
- Please, Cooper.
I do not suffer fools gladly, and fools with badges, never.
I want no interference from this hulking boob. 
Is that clear?
I've had just about enough of your insults.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I've had about enough of morons and half-wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells.
And youchowderhead yokel, youblithering hayseed, you've had enough of me?
Yes, I have.
That's nice. 
How appropriate.
Wait in the car, Harry.
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?
A hail of bullets would be nice.
That's enough.
The sheriff didn't mean anything.
- He hit me.
- Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.
Albert, release this girl's body to her family immediately.
I want your test results by noon.
Those are orders.
Thank you, Agent Cooper.
Invitation to love
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet...
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade...
Evan St Vincent as Jared Lancaster... and Jason Denbo as Montana.
My darling daughter Jade...and Emerald.
Because of my financial difficulties, I have decided to end it all tonight.
I hope youcan find the strength to go on without me. 
Your loving father...
Uncle Leland?
Uncle Leland?
Madeleine?
Jadr, what a surprisr.
Maddy? 
Is it you?
Uncle Leland...
I am so sorry.
I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion.
Your husband has been a model prisoner, an inspiration to guard and inmate alike.
He greets the day with a smile and confounds adversity with a kind word.
Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.
Barring unforeseen circumstance, with your full support before the board, he could be released shortly thereafter.
Any questions?
No.
Will youhelp find the job that Hank needs to effect successful parole?
- Yes.
- How exactly?
I own the RR Mr Mooney.
You're quite a girl, Norma.
I'll bet youget all kinds of Romeos in here begging for favours.
How do youkeep them from your door?
I usually tell them I have a homicidally jealous husband who's doing 3-5 for manslaughter.
But he expects to be a productive member of society real soon.
That should conclude our session for today, Mrs Jennings.
Look at that!
Ducks on the lake!
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.
Leo's one of those guys youkeep your eye on.
So far, we haven't caught him with his paws in the cookie jar.
Morning, Leo.
Who the hell is he?
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
So ask.
"Leo". 
Is that short for "Leonard"?
That's a question?
- Did youknow Laura Palmer?
- No.
- How well did youknow her?
- I said I didn't.
You're lying.
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.
- Do youhave a criminal record?
- Nothing. 
Youcan look it up.
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.
Drunk and disorderly, November 1987.
September '88, aggravated assault, charges dropped.
I paid my debt to society.
Where were youthe night of Laura Palmer's murder? 
Around midnight?
On the road. 
I called my wife Shelly from Butte, Montana.
- She'll confirm this?
- If youask her.
Robert?
This may be a good time for a brief discussion.
Youwant to talk about cigarettes?
Today?
No, but put it out. 
It's a filthy habit, especially for a varsity athlete.
I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many.
Any time a man dies in war, he dies too soon.
Laura died too soon as well.
Yeah, she did.
But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert.
Responsibility is the linchpin of our society.
Each man responsible for his own actions, each action contributing to the greater good.
What's the good of putting someone in the ground?
That's man's way of achieving closure.
In ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind.
In your life, youmust learn, you will learn, to carry on without them.
Great.
I realise youexperience an ongoing disinclination to enter fully into meaningful ex change.
This leads to stalemate and a desire on my part to force certain wisdom upon you.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes it's the best course available.
Son, don't be afraid.
We'll all be there together.
- Afraid of what?
- Well, the funeral.
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.
Afraid?
I can hardly wait.
Afraid?
!
I'm gonna turn it upside down!
Everybody ready?
Deputy Hawk.
Agent Cooper, there's no sign of the man with one arm.
Keep trying.
He's out there somewhere.
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.
- He's a tracker?
- The best.
OK, Albert.
What have yougot?
Enough forensic spadework to save your butt and get mine out of this godforsaken burg.
What have yougot?
OK, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary: cocaine.
Toxicology results also positive.
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.
We've got fibres of twine embedded in her wrists and upper arms.
Two different kinds of twine.
Fibres of twine found in railroad car matched the sample from her wrist.
The same twine was used to bind the Pulaski girl.
Conclusion: she was tied up twice, at different locations, the night she died.
Once here, once here. 
Like this.
"Sometimes my arms bend back."
We found traces of pumice in standing water outside the railroad car.
Soap, industrial strength.
I found identical particles on Laura's neck. 
It's not her home-use brand.
My conclusion:
the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss.
Like this.
Good Lord...
Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be claw marks, bites of some kind.
An animal?
Look, it's trying to think.
Finally, a small plastic fragment from her stomach, partially dissolved by digestive acids.
I'm taking it back for reconstruction, as the local facilities give new meaning to the word "primitive".
I note with some interest what appears to be the letter "J".
Good work, Albert.
A couple more days, who knows what I might have found?
Sheriff? 
It's time.
Ex cuse us. 
We have got a funeral to get to.
Cooper, may I have a word with youalone?
There's also a report concerning the physical assault on me this morning.
I think you'll find it's quite accurate.
Requires your signature.
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.
What?
Albert, I hope youcan hear me. 
I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time.
But in that time I have seen decency, honour and dignity.
Murder is not a faceless event here.
It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day.
Laura Palmer's death has affected every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life.
That's a way of living I thought had vanished, but it hasn't.
It's right here in Twin Peaks.
Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.
With your behaviour towards these good people, you're lucky I do not file a report that could bury youso deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.
Diane, it's 12:27 pm.
Look into my pension plan options on outside real estate investment.
I may purchase a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.
Love me?
Youbet.
This a new one?
Yes.
Isn't it beautiful?
How do I look?
- Well, youlook fine, Nadine.
- Oh, Ed!
Last night was wonderful.
Oh, my darling Ed, youcame back to me.
Now I feel like we're really together again.
In high school,
I used to watch Norma and you at those football games.
She was so pretty.
Youmade such a handsome couple.
But I knew... even though...
I was just... a little nobody... just a little brown mouse...
I always knew inside... once yougot to know me... we'd be together forever.
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?
It's James.
James who?
- We don't want to be late. 
Ready?
- I'm not going.
It's Laura, James.
- I can't. 
I just can't.
- James!
I don't care what the doctor says.
If youkeep indulging him, he is never going to change.
I don't think we should discuss this while Johnny is here.
- Johnny doesn't know what day it is.
- We have to be patient, Ben.
Yoube patient. 
I have waited 20 years for some sign of intelligent life.
I'm clear about this, Sylvia.
I have my limits.
Don't I know it?
Fine, let's all spray venom in my general direction.
- Youtake it with no problem.
- Taking it is a speciality of the house.
Sylvia, I'm gonna make it extremely simple for you.
We can't take Johnny to the funeral in that ridiculous getup.
Then let the great Doctor Jacoby see what he can do.
Youdo it then.
Am I going to have to call Doctor Jacoby every damn time I have a problem with Johnny?
Thank God. 
All right, let's everyone just get into the car.
I am the Resurrection and the Life.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
For none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself.
For, if we live, we live unto the Lord and, if we die, we die unto the Lord.
Whether we live, therefore, or we die, we are the Lord's.
Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord.
Even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours.
The Lord be with thee.
Let us pray.
O, God, entrust this child Laura to Thy never-failing care and love and bring us all to Thy heavenly kingdom through the same, Thy son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee, and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and forever. 
Amen.
I baptised Laura Palmer.
I instructed her in Sunday school.
And I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for the headstrong and the bold.
Laura was bright.
She was beautiful, she was charming.
But most of all Laura was, I think, impatient.
She was impatient for her life to begin, for the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions.
Laura used to say that I talk too much.
I'll not make that mistake today.
Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days.
Amen!
Amen!
Thank you, Johnny.
Amen!
What are youlooking at?
What are youwaiting for?
Youmake me sick.
Youdamn hypocrites make me sick!
Everybody knew she was in trouble, but we didn't do anything.
All yougood people...
Youwanna know who killed Laura?
Youdid!
We all did.
And pretty words aren't gonna bring her back, man, so save your prayers.
She would've laughed at them anyway.
Youare dead, man! 
You're dead!
That's enough, Bobby. 
That's enough!
Youare dead!
Get off me!
Youare dead, man. 
Dead!
Youare dead, man. 
God... 
Dead!
Get off me!
Ah, my baby. 
Laura!
Laura! 
Laura!
Lee, hang on.
The whole thing has gone haywire.
Don't ruin this, too!
My baby!
Laura!
Laura!
Here's the father and this is his daughter in the coffin.
I'm telling you, Harry, he's just not gonna figure this out.
Ed, that's a bet I'll take. 
For the check.
He's right on time.
Harry, careful who youtrust.
He's just not one of us.
Cooper, take a seat.
Harry, I got your note.
Hawk. 
Big Ed.
How would youlike some fresh huckleberry pie?
I would love a slice of pie.
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated.
- Vanilla ice cream, coffee.
- Coming right up.
Big Ed, how long have youbeen in love with Norma?
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.
What did youcall me in for besides the highlights of the menu?
You'd better tell him.
Somebody's running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border.
We've tried for six months to set up a bust, top to bottom. 
Nobody walks.
- Who's targeted?
- Jacques Renault.
Bartender at the Roadhouse.
We figure him for the middle man.
Ed's been doing some undercover.
The night yougot into town, he was staking Renault out.
We think Renault slipped him a mickey.
Felt like being hit with a log splitter.
- I didn't know youwere a deputy.
- He's not.
It's a little outside your jurisdiction.
Somebody's selling drugs to high school kids.
That's everybody's jurisdiction.
I call Ed in when I need him.
He's not the only one I called.
- Thanks, Norma.
- Enjoy.
This must be where pies go when they die.
OK, Harry, would youplease tell me why youreally called me in here?
Go along with me on this, even if it sounds a little weird.
- I'm with you.
- Twin Peaks is different.
A long way from the world.
You've noticed that.
- Yes, I have.
- That's exactly the way we like it.
But there's a back end to that that's kind of different, too.
Maybe that's the price we pay for the good things.
- What would that be?
- There's a sort of evil out there.
Something very, very strange in these old woods.
Call it what youwant.
A darkness. 
A presence.
It takes many forms, but it's been out there for as long as anyone can remember.
- We've always been here to fight it.
- We?
Men before us. 
Men before them.
- More after we're gone.
- A secret society.
Why don't we take Agent Cooper for a little ride?
- Where to?
- The Bookhouse.
This is where we get together.
- Going on 20 years now.
- "We" meaning...?
The Bookhouse Boys.
- Coffee's free.
- Like the sound of that.
Cooper, youknow James.
- Agent Cooper.
- James.
- This is Joey Paulson.
- Joey.
- Who's this?
- Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.
Janitor at the Roadhouse.
Bernard came across the border this morning with an ounce of cocaine.
Thought we'd ask him a few questions.
- Did yousell drugs to Laura Palmer?
- I don't sell drugs.
How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule?
Jacques don't pay me nothing.
I'm no mule.
- So that ounce was for personal use?
- That's right.
I guess youdon't get much sleep at night, Bernie.
Your brother didn't come to work the last few days. 
Where's he been?
I don't know.
He got personal business.
- Who else is he dealing with?
- Why don't youask him?
He'll be back tonight. 
Any minute.
- To work at the Roadhouse?
- He's the bartender, isn't he?
Bernard, we've got youtied up in a chair.
You're mix ed up with your brother in a wide variety of felonies.
Why in the world would youtell us where and when to find him?
- Yeah?
- Leo, it's Jacques.
- What's up?
- The light. 
The bust light's on.
- Bernard's in trouble.
- Yousure?
I saw it, man. 
Yougotta get me out of here, Leo. 
Border run.
- Where are you?
- Phone booth by the Cash  Carry.
- And I don't like waiting, man.
- Shut up. 
I'm on my way.
Hi.
- Where are yougoing?
- Youdon't need to know.
Josie? 
Josie, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing?
God, you're beautiful.
Josie, there is something wrong.
What is it? 
I want youto tell me.
Something horrible is going to happen.
- They want to hurt me. 
I know it.
- Who? 
Who wants to hurt you?
Catherine.
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.
What makes youthink so?
I heard Catherine on the phone saying I'd never suspect.
Just like with Andrew's death.
- Andrew's death was an accident.
- Was it?
Catherine keeps the mill account books in her safe.
Two books, different numbers.
Andrew built this years ago.
I don't think Catherine knows that I know it's here.
Why do youthink they have two sets of books?
The usual reasons would be something to do with stealing. 
Maybe worse.
There were two. 
I sawthem.
- Youbelieve me, don't you?
- Of course I do.
- There's nothing unusual in this one.
- There were two.
I swear, there were two.
Have...have youseen my tackle box?
The next time youand the merry widow want to take a peak in my safe, don't go to so much trouble.
Be a man about it, Pete.
Ask me to my face.
Maybe I'll check the truck.
Dr Jacoby?
I didn't see youat the funeral today.
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.
I pretend that I'm not.
But I am.
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems.
Day after day.
These people think of me as their friend.
Truth is, I really don't care.
I thought nothing, no one could ever reach me again.
Laura changed all that.
I couldn't come today.
I just couldn't.
I hope she understands.
I hope she forgives me.
Youthink it's possible?
Youthink somebody killed Andrew?
I don't know.
I believe what they want is to take the mill away from me.
For Benjamin to have the land.
If it was true with Andrew... youthink they'll kill me too?
Think they would?
Josie...
Nothing is gonna happen to you.
Not now, not ever.
Not while I'm around.
Do youbelieve in the soul?
Several.
- More than one?
- Blackfoot legend.
Waking souls that give life to the mind and the body.
A dream soul that wanders.
Dream souls...
- Where do they wander?
- Faraway places.
The Land of the Dead.
Is that where Laura is?
Laura is in the ground, Agent Cooper.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.
To Laura.
Godspeed.
- Will youdance with me?
- Sorry.
Please?
Dance with me? 
Please?
- Dance with me.
- Leave us alone.
Dance with me, please.
Please.
Please.
Somebody dance with me.
- Mr Palmer?
- Leland.
Let's take youhome.

AND WE PLANNED ALL SORTS OF STUFF FOR VALENTINE'S DAY. 
SEE?
VALENTINE'S DAY? 
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SENTIMENTAL DRIVEL.
FOR YEARS I'VE SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR THE LOST TEMPLE OF APHRODUCKY.
HERE AT LAST!
I HAVE A MAP THAT WILL LEAD ME RIGHT TO IT.
SO?
SO, APHRODUCKY WAS REVERED AS THE GODDESS OF LOVE.
AND LEGEND HAS IT THAT HER TEMPLE CONTAINS
THE GREATEST TREASURE OF ALL.
CAN WE COME?
PLEASE, HUH?
NO! 
THIS TIME YOU ARE STAYING HOME.
THIS TRIP IS TOO DANGEROUS.
NOW BE GOOD.
WE'LL VISIT WHEN I GET BACK WITH THE TREASURE.
MAYBE HE SHOULD SEND A VALENTINE TO FORT KNOX.
GEE, FIRST WE DON'T SEE HIM WHEN HE'S HERE
AND THEN HE DOES SOMETHING FUN
AND WE GET LEFT BEHIND.
MAYBE WE DO AND MAYBE WE DON'T.
BOY, I LOVE THIS JOB.
THE WIND IN YOUR FEATHERS,
THE THROATY ROAR OF THE ENGINES...
THE CONSTANT FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE.
YEAH, FLYING.
NOTHING LIKE IT.
JUST LAND THIS THING.
ORDINARILY, I'D DIVE RIGHT IN,
BUT I HEAR THESE WATERS ARE INFESTED WITH SHARKS.
JUST RUMORS. 
BESIDES, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T SCARED OF ANYTHING.
HEY, THERE'S SCARED AND THEN THERE'S STUPID.
AND YOU'RE AN EXPERT ON BOTH.
NOW GO FIND ME THAT TREASURE.
IT'S SO HARD TO GET GOOD HELP,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.
Ouch!
OK! 
COME OUT NICE AND SLOW, YOU STOWAWAYS!
DON'T SHOOT, UNCLE SCROOGE.
DID I NOT TELL YOU THIS TRIP WAS DANGEROUS?
WE LAUGH IN THE FACE OF DANGER.
OH? 
LET'S SEE YOU LAUGH IN THE FACE
OF A MONTH WITHOUT DESSERT.
YO! 
MR. McD.!
YOU FOUND SOMETHING?
THIS IS THE TEMPLE OF APHRODUCKY!
NOW KEEP YOUR PEEPERS PEELED FOR PRICELESS PLUNDER.
PERSONALLY, I'D PREFER TO PROTECT MY POSTERIOR FROM PREDATORS.
THERE'S NO SHARK WITHIN 100 MILES.
THERE'S GOT TO BE TREASURE HERE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES.
WHO ARE THE RUBES IN THE ROBES?
DON'T YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY?
HEY, I DON'T KNOW MY ZIP CODE.
THE ANGRY LOOKING GUY...
HE'S VULCAN, THE BLACKSMITH OF MOUNT OLYMPUS. 
RIGHT?
RIGHT. 
AND THIS IS APHRODUCKY.
HELLO, APHRODUCKY.
WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN THIS TREASURE OF YOURS?
LOOK. 
IT'S CUPID.
ISN'T HE CUTE?
SAY CHEESE.
CHEESE.
WHAT'S THIS?
HEY, IT'S GREEK TO ME.
SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY IT.
OUT OF MY WAY.
AH, THE GREATEST TREASURE!
QUICK! 
OPEN IT, LADS.
IT'S EMPTY!
EXCEPT FOR THAT.
WHAT'S PILIOS?
IT MEANS LOVE.
LOVE? 
THE GREATEST TREASURE IS LOVE?
OOOH! 
I COULD'VE GOTTEN THAT NEWS
OUT OF ONE OF THOSE SAPPY VALENTINES.
I'VE BEEN ROBBED! 
THERE'S NO TREASURE HERE AT ALL.
DON'T BE SO SURE.
CUPID'S ARROW'S ARE SOLID GOLD!
THINGS HAVE TAKEN A TURN.
YEAH, FOR THE WORSE!
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, MR. McD.,
SAVE THE KIDS.
HEY, FISH FACE! 
OVER HERE!
I'M GONNA HATE THIS!
YAAAA!
WHOA! 
WHOA! 
HEY, STOP!
WE'VE GOTTA HELP HIM!
FOLLOW ME AND STAY LOW.
YEOOOW!
YUK!
NOW!
LAUNCHPAD!
SAY SOMETHING!
BABY!
BABY?
- BABY?
BABY?
HI, WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?
NO, NO, LET ME GUESS.
PISCES? 
I'M AN ARIES.
ARIES? 
YOU MEAN AIRHEAD.
HANG ON TO THIS LOVE SICK LUNATIC.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THANK YOU.
I'LL MISS YOU, SWEET FINS.
SHOULD HE BE FLYING A PLANE?
I THINK HIS MIND HAD A MELTDOWN.
THAT'S NEVER STOPPED HIM BEFORE.
YEAH, BUT HE'S NEVER TRIED TO KISS A TWO-TON FEEDING MACHINE, EITHER.
LAUNCHPAD STARTED ACTING WEIRD
AFTER HE GOT JABBED BY ONE OF THOSE.
YOU DON'T THINK...
THOSE REALLY ARE CUPID'S ARROWS.
AH, GREETING-CARD GARBAGE.
BUT THAT WAS THE TEMPLE OF APHRODUCKY,
THE GODDESS OF LOVE.
THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF MUMBO-JUMBO.
AH, COME ON, VULCAN.
WHERE'D YOU HIDE CUPID'S ARROW?
I AM TIRED OF YOU GOING AROUND POKING THE EARTH FOLK
WITH THOSE ARROWS...
MAKING THIS ONE FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT ONE.
WHAT KIND OF HOBBY'S THAT?
OH, POOR VULKY'S JEALOUS.
I DON'T HAVE TO BE JEALOUS.
YOU ARE THE WIFE.
I AM THE HUSBAND.
AND THE HUSBAND IS KING!
KING! 
OK, THEN, I'LL CROWN YOU.
MY MOTHER GAVE US THIS PLANT!
WHERE ARE THOSE ARROWS?
I'M WARNING YOU, APHRODUCKY...
OH, GO SIT ON A VOLCANO!
I COULD'VE MARRIED ADONIS,
BUT, NO. 
I HAD TO MARRY THAT HOTHEAD!
WHAT! 
MY MAGIC LAMP'S LIT!
THAT MEANS SOMEONE'S IN MY TEMPLE.
BETTER TAKE A LOOK WITH MY MAGIC MONITOR.
YOU OVERGROWN MACKEREL!
YOU'VE RUINED MY RUINS!
AH! 
THAT'S CUPID'S QUIVER.
VULCAN MUST HAVE HIDDEN THE ARROWS IN OWN TEMPLE.
ONLY THEY'RE NOT THERE NOW.
I'LL REWIND BACK THROUGH TIME TO SEE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
AH-HA! 
LITTLE MAN, YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
THAT THIS PRIZE HAS A PRICE.
I HOPE UNCLE SCROOGE LIKES THESE VALENTINES.
GATHER AROUND.
I HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL TO SHOW YOU.
FOR US? 
WOW!
TA-DA!
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?
YEAH. 
SWELL, UNCLE SCROOGE.
WE WERE HOPING IT WAS SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.
THIS SO-CALLED HOLIDAY IS JUST A PLOY
BY THE CARD AND CANDY COMPANIES TO MAKE A BUCK.
AH, GEE, UNCLE SCROOGE.
DON'T "AH, GEE" ME.
I WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET THESE ARROWS.
[ KNOCKING ]
NOW WHAT?
LOOK!
WHO ARE YOU?
!
WHY, SILLY PERSON, I'M APHRODUCKY.
APHRODUCKY?
!
APHRODUCKY?
!
YES. 
I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH
SO DON'T BOTHER TO GROVEL.
JUST GIVE ME BACK MY ARROWS.
YOUR ARROWS?
YES, I USE THEM TO SPREAD LOVE AND JOY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
THANKS, BUT WE'VE GOT ALL THE LOVE AND JOY WE CAN STAND.
YOU GOT IN, NOW SHOW YOURSELF OUT.
THERE OUGHT TO BE LAWS AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
LOOK! 
I'VE HAD A VERY BAD MILLENNIUM.
GIVE ME THOSE ARROWS!
THAT REALLY IS APHRODUCKY!
I DON'T CARE IS SHE'S FEATHER LOCKLEAR,
SHE'S NOT GETTING MY ARROWS.
YEOOW!
LET ME DOWN!
STOP! 
STOP! 
LET ME DOWN!
LEAVE MY UNCLE SCROOGE ALONE!
UNCLE SCROOGE! 
ARE YOU OK?
AH! 
THE ARROWS!
HE'S FINE.
YOU'VE RUINED MY MONEY BIN.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?
DARLING!
DARLING?
THERE. 
IS THAT COMFY, SUGAR PLUM?
NO! 
IT IS NOT COMFY.
AND I AM NOT YOUR SUGAR PLUM!
LOOK! 
I'VE HUMORED YOU LONG ENOUGH.
LEAVE ME ALONE!
BUT, DUMPLING, WAIT.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP UNCLE SCROOGE GET RID OF APHRODUCKY
BEFORE SHE LOVES HIM TO DEATH.
SURE. 
YOU TELL HER TO GO HOME.
LISTEN. 
APHRODUCKY'S STILL UNDER THE SPELL OF THOSE ARROWS, RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST THING YOU SEE
ONCE YOU'RE STUCK.
BUT IF WE UNDID THE SPELL
SHE'D FORGET UNCLE SCROOGE AND GO.
SO ALL WE GOTTA DO IS STICK HER AGAIN,
AND MAKE SURE THE NEXT PERSON SHE SEES IS HERSELF.
SCROOGEY-WOOGEY.
WHERE ARE YOU?
OK, WHEN THE DOOR OPENS
WE DROP THE TAPESTRY
AND MAKE POINTS WITH APHRODUCKY.
SHHH. 
I HEAR FOOTSTEPS.
OOOH!
OOOH!
UH-OH. 
THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE APHRODUCKY TO ME.
YOU CALLED?
UNCLE SCROOGE! 
YAAAA!
SWEETHEART!
SWEETHEART?
!
EXTRA! 
EXTRA!
READ ALL ABOUT IT!
mcduck HOOKS HEAVENLY BODY!
HE'S TEARING UP THE WHOLE BACKYARD
TO BUILD APHRODUCKY A NEW TEMPLE.
BOY, ALL THIS LOVEY-DOVEY STUFF IS ENOUGH
TO TURN YOU OFF VALENTINE'S DAY FOR KEEPS.
WHATTA YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
I'M GONNA GIVE UNCLE SCROOGE THE VALENTINE GIFT I MADE HIM.
WEBBIE! 
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR VALENTINE.
AND HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US.
WELL, I STILL CARE ABOUT HIM.
UNCLE SCROOGE!
UNCLE SCROOGE!
HUH?
I WAS GONNA GIVE THIS TO YOU TOMORROW ON VALENTINE'S DAY,
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE IT NOW.
A VALENTINE CUPCAKE? 
LOVELY.
YOU LIKE IT?
YES. 
ENOUGH TO GIVE IT TO MY DEAREST APHRODUCKY.
OH, HOW... 
SWEET.
UNCLE SCROOGE!
THAT WAS FOR YOU!
PHONE FOR YOU, SIR.
REGARDING THE PRESS CONFERENCE YOU WISH TO ARRANGE.
OH, THANK YOU, DUCKWORTH.
JUST ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR MY LITTLE LOLLIPOP LIPS.
LOLLIPOP LIPS! 
YECK!
NOW WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
UNCLE SCROOGE DOESN'T LOVE US
SO I'M RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME.
WEBBIE, IT'S NOT THAT HE DOESN'T LOVE US.
IT'S JUST THAT HE'S UNDER THAT STUPID ARROW'S SPELL.
SO? 
EITHER WAY, WE'VE LOST HIM.
WHAT?
!
WELL, THIS IS ME SAYING GOODBYE.
ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME TOO?
DON'T TRY TO TALK ME OUT OF IT.
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT.
THE SHARK AGAIN?
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BUT MY FINNY LITTLE VALENTINE.
SO I'M GOING BACK TO OFFER HER MY HAND.
SHE'LL TAKE YOUR HAND
AND THE ARM THAT GOES WITH IT.
BUT IF YOU LIVE UNDERWATER,
THAN YOU'LL NEVER FLY A PLANE AGAIN.
NEVER FLY AGAIN?
HEY, WE GOING TO A POOL PARTY?
THAT'S IT! 
THAT'S WHAT BREAKS THE SPELL...
TRUE LOVE!
WHEN LAUNCHPAD HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE SHARK AND FLYING...
POW! 
IT'S THE CURE.
SO WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE UNCLE SCROOGE CHOOSE BETWEEN APHRODUCKY
AND WHAT HE LOVES THE MOST...
MONEY!
COMMENCE OPERATION ALLERGY.
OH, HI, APHRODUCKY.
WHATTA YOU WANT?
UNCLE SCROOGE IS BUSY,
SO WE CAME DOWN TO PLAY WITH YOU.
DON'T BE SILLY.
I'M A DEITY AND DEITIES SIMPLY DON'T PLA...
AA-AAA-AACHOO!
UH-OH. 
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S GOT CASHITITIS.
CASHA-WHAT'S IT?
IT MEANS YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO MONEY.
FIRST YOU START SNEEZING...
AACHOOO!
THEN YOUR SKIN TURNS GREEN.
AAAAH!
AND THEN YOUR FEATHERS FALL OUT.
YAAA!
GIVE IT AWAY, SCROOGEY.
ALL YOUR MONEY IS MAKING ME SICK.
BU-BU-BUT, MY MONEY?
OH NO!
IT WAS AWFUL, UNCLE SCROOGE.
I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE.
IT'S EITHER YOUR MONEY OR APHRODUCKY.
AH, ALL RIGHT, I WILL CHOOSE.
COME ON. 
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE I CALLED
IS AWAITING US OUTSIDE.
NOW SHE'S GONNA GET IT.
HONEY, IT'S ME, VULCAN.
HELLO.
HOW CAN I APOLOGIZE IF SHE'S NOT EVEN AROUND?
HUH? 
APHRODUCKY?
IT SEEMS I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN APHRODUCKY AND MY MONEY.
SO I ASK MYSELF, WHICH DO I LOVE MORE?
WELL, THAT'S EASY TO ANSWER.
APHRODUCKY, MY GODDESS OF LOVE.
WHAT?
!
WHAT?
!
AH, SCROOGEY POO.
AFTER ALL, WHAT GOOD IS MONEY
WITHOUT MY HONEY?
SO I'M GOING TO MARRY HER.
OVER YOUR DEAD BODY, BUDDY!
WHICH WAY IS DUCKBURG?
THANKS.
WHEN WILL YOU RETURN, SIR?
OH, NEVER. 
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
I'M OFF TO SPEND THE REST OF ETERNITY ON MOUNT OLYMPUS.
THEN I WON'T COUNT ON YOU FOR DINNER.
ALL SET TO GO, LAUNCHPAD?
AYE, AYE, SIR. 
THE JET'S ALL GET FOR YOU
AND YOUR LADY FRIEND.
DEAREST, DID YOU BRING MY ARROWS?
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE, CUPCAKE.
UNCLE SCROOGE, WAIT!
YEAH?
LISTEN, UNCLE SCROOGE.
YOU'RE UNDER A MAGIC SPELL.
YOU DON'T BELONG ON MOUNT OLYMPUS.
AND NEITHER DO WE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
AS MUCH AS WE LOVE YOU, WE CAN'T GO.
BYE, UNCLE SCROOGE.
GOODBYE?
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. 
SAY GOODBYE TO THE LITTLE MORTAL PERSONS.
BUT THEY LOVE ME.
HEY, WE'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH.
WHATTA YOU THINK THIS IS?
IT'S BAR-B-QUE TIME!
VULCAN!
AH, LIVE LONG AND PROSPER.
AND I LOVE THEM,
AND THEN AGAIN, I ALSO LOVE APHRODUCKY.
THIS IS SO CONFUSING.
BE STILL, YOU WIFE SNATCHER!
LADDIES! 
WEBBIE!
UNCLE SCROOGE!
I'M COMING!
HELLO, SCROOGEY!
RUN FOR IT, MR. McD.
I'LL KEEP LAVA BREATH BUSY.
OF COURSE, I MEAN LAVA BREATH AS A COMPLIMENT.
HEY, NICE CRASH.
UNCLE SCROOGE, YOU'RE OK.
YEAH, ALL OUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED.
EXCEPT FOR ONE.
RUN! 
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
YO-HO. 
OVER HERE.
COME AND GET ME.
SAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, DEAD DUCK!
YAAAA!
TALK ABOUT LEAVING AN IMPRESSION.
UNCLE SCROOGE!
NOW I'M REALLY ANGRY!
DON'T YOU TOUCH MY SCROOGEY!
COME ON. 
WE'RE GONNA SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.
OH, NO! 
SHE'S STILL STUCK ON UNCLE SCROOGE.
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!
LOOK, VUL. 
I LOVE SCROOGE NOW.
SO IF I EVER SO MUCH AS SEE YOUR UGLY FACE AGAIN
I'LL... 
YAAAAA!
YOU'LL WHAT?
I'LL GIVE IT A BIG KISS.
ONE MINUTE SHE'S READY TO FRY HIM AND THE NEXT...
ISN'T TRUE LOVE WONDERFUL?
WHAT CAN I SAY, SCROOGE?
YOU AND I JUST LOST THAT SPECIAL MAGIC.
YOU COULD PUT IT THAT WAY.
BEFORE WE GO, COULD I HAVE THOSE ARROWS BACK?
SURE, I'VE GOT ALL THE TREASURE I NEED RIGHT HERE.

I... 
I just rule it now...
With a soft glove.
And it's important to me to be the mother, 'cause there's so many little kids that I have to look out for.
Although they don't listen to me, and they buck my authority,
I still think I rule it pretty well.
They like me.
I'm one of the more popular ones, and I've been around for two decades... reigning, that is.
You know, I've got more grand prizes than all the rest.

I went to a ball.
I got a trophy.
And now everybody wants to know me.
This movie is about the ball circuit and the gay people that's involved in it and how each person's life brought them to this circuit.
It's like crossing into the looking glass in wonderland.
You go in there, and you feel...
you feel 100% right... as... of being gay.
And that's not what it's like in the world.

We may spend more time preparing for a ball than anybody would spend preparing for anything else.

The balls, to us, is as close to reality as we're gonna get to all of that fame and fortune and stardom and spotlights.
Man: 
I'd always see the way that rich people lived.
And I'd feel it more, you know... it would slap me in the face.
I'd say, "I'd have to have that."
Because I never felt comfortable being poor.
Or even middle class doesn't suit me.
Seeing the riches, seeing the way people on "dynasty" lived...
And I would think,
"these people have 42 rooms in their house.
Oh, my God.
What kind of a house is that?"
And we've got three.
So why is it that they can have it and I didn't?
I always felt cheated out of things like that.

As far as all of y'all not walking, please realize that we all...
at one time or another... have lusted to walk a ballroom floor.
So give the patrons and the contestants, you know, a round of applause for nerve.
'Cause with y'all vicious mother[Bleep], it do take nerve.
Believe me.
We're not going to be shady, just fierce.
Those balls are more or less like our fantasy of being a superstar.
You know, like the oscars or whatever.
Or being on a runway as a model.
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the balls, they don't have two of nothing.
Some of them don't even eat.
They come to balls starving.
And they sleep in the under-21, or they sleep on the pier or wherever.
They don't have a home to go to.
But they'll go out, and they'll steal something and get dressed up and come to a ball for that one night and live the fantasy.

A ball is the very word... whatever you want to be, you be.
So at a ball, you have a chance to display your arrogance, your seductiveness, your beauty, your wit,
You can become anything and do anything right here, right now, and it won't be questioned.
I came. 
I saw. 
I conquered.

She'll bring it to you every ball.

I guess I like the excitement.
You know, it's them cheering and screaming if you were good.
And that's what got me, 'cause I like the competition.
Makes me stronger.
It makes me think more.
Makes me want to come back and get them.
It's not just the winning.
It's... it's the giving, too.
'Cause I feel that I give a lot of enjoyment to a lot of people that go to balls.
And they enjoy to see it, and I enjoy to walk for them.
So that's my... 
Philosophy, as I should say.

To be legendary is like... their goal is to be legendary.

I've been at the balls with the legendary children, and I've stamped myself with the legendary children.
But I'm really...
I'm one of top, upcoming children...

You have legendary children and upcoming legendary children.
Right.
We're the upcoming ones.
We've been out longer than the ones that are here now.
And we done had our... we have our status in the ballroom.
How long did it take you to do the tank top?
An hour?
Yes.
You don't do that.

'Cause if I don't go to a ball with him and iron,
I mean, he'll be here wrinkled.
Or he'd be there ironing.
But, you know, it helps out when somebody else is there in your corner, at your side, to say, "yeah, you can do it."
"You're gonna be fine.
Just go out there and do what you usually do."
Just simple, you know, joy and satisfaction.

But it's a high that won't hurt you.
If everybody went to balls and did less drugs, it'd be a fun world, wouldn't it?
I'm dressing, of course, to go do a show.
Because I've always done this professionally.
And I was a dancer.
And I'm trying to remember when the first time I went to a ball.
That was the early-type ball, when everybody just walked, and they gave away, like, four or five prizes in a very limited category.
And the children now...
most of them... 75% of the children you see at the ball wouldn't know what a ball was if it knocked them in the head.
Labeija: 
When I first started going to balls, it was all about drag queens, and they were interested in looking like
Las Vegas show girls... backpieces, tailpieces, feathers, beads, and all that.
But as the '70s rolled around, the thing started changing.
It started coming down to just wanting to look like a gorgeous movie star, like Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor.
And now they've went from that to trying to look like models like Iman and Christie Brinkley and maud Adams and all those children.
Corey: 
Everyone couldn't be a Las Vegas show girl.
Everyone couldn't put on a stack of feathers and a big headpiece.
So they made the categories where everybody... that's what really made the balls change.
So there was more involvement.
Everyone that goes to one of these affairs now damn near participates.
Eventually, over the course of a year's balls, they've all walked the runway in some category or another.
Either you've got a nice body or you are very fashionable or you're very pretty or you're very real-looking.
But there's always something there for everyone.
And it's like...
it's like in nature...
I'm such a nature fan... the young ones are always bucking to move the... the old bulls out of the way.
go through all these mad categories that I never can stay awake for.

In real life, you can't get a job as an executive unless you have the educational background and the opportunity.
Now, the fact that you are not an executive is merely because of the social standing of life.
That is just pure thing.
Black people have a hard time getting anywhere.
And those that do are usually straight.
In a ballroom, you can be anything you want.
but you're looking like an executive.
And therefore you're showing the straight world that
"I can be an executive.
"If I had the opportunity, I could be one, because I can look like one."

My mother knew I had trophies, but I was telling her I won them for basketball.
And I had won trophies for running track.
I was walking up 145th street with my girlfriends.
I had on white hot pants, a chiffon blouse, a pony tail.
And my father was waiting for the light in his car.
And he saw me.
He recognized me.
And he went straight to my house before I could get there and told my mother,
"your son is a woman."
She didn't press it then.
But, like, maybe a few months later when she noticed that I had breasts, everything started coming together.
She really was devastated.
"How could you have breasts bigger than mine?
"You're growing nails.
"You're becoming a woman right before my very eyes.
"I can't hold my head up.
And she still loved me, but the nagging and the... oh, my God, about this women's clothes.
And when I had women's clothes stashed in my closet and she found them, she would destroy them.
She burnt up a mink coat.
I was, oh... 
Devastated.
She smelled the perfume in it that I liked to wear... which was jungle gardenia at the time... and she said, "this ain't no girl's coat.
This is your coat."
Took it downstairs in the backyard of the building and burned it.
And I stood there and cried like a baby.
As long I have the mustache and all that, it's cute for me.

She can't take it.
Corey:
When they're undetectable... when they can walk out of that ballroom into the sunlight and onto the subway and get home and still have all their clothes and no blood running off their bodies... those are the femme realness queens.

And some of them think that we are the most gorgeous, special things on earth.

And I didn't want to embarrass them, so that's when I moved away.
I moved to New York, and I continued doing it.
When someone has rejection from their mother and father, their family, they... when they get out in the world, they search.
They search for someone to fill that void.
I know this for experience, because I've had kids come to me and latch hold to me like I'm their mother or like I'm their father.
'Cause they can talk to me, and I'm gay, and they're gay.
And that's where a lot of that "ballness"
and... and the mother business comes in.
Because their real parents give them such a hard way to go, they look up to me to fill that void.

They're families.
You can say that.

But this is a new meaning of "family."
The hippies had families, and no one thought nothing about it.
It wasn't a question of a man and a woman and children, which we grew up knowing as a family.
It's a question of a group of human beings in a mutual bond.

I'll tell you what a house is.
A house is a gay street gang.
Now, where street gangs get their rewards from street fights, a gay house street-fights at a ball.
And you street-fight at a ball by walking in the categories.
The houses started because you wanted a name.
The people that the houses are named after were ball walkers who became known for winning.

After the first few houses were started and named after people who had won trophies, they also would create houses.

"you have to walk a ball for us.
"And if you snatch a trophy, then you can become the Xtravaganza."
That's how it's supposed to work with any... everyone.
But, uh...
Like, that wasn't with me.
I just became an Xtravaganza.
He's the one who started the house.
He was the first gay man I ever met.
The first time he took me to the village... which was my birthday...
I had just turned 15 years old.
And he threw a party for me out there.
He bought me a cake.
I met a lot of drag queens, transvestites, that I didn't believe were because they were so beautiful.
And that kind of sunk into my head.
And I guess that's why it kind of made me want to even do it more.
They treat each other like sisters, mm-hmm.
Sisters...
Or brothers...
Or mothers or...
You know, like, I say, "oh, that's my sister,"
because she's gay, too, and I'm gay, and she's a drag queen or whatever.

I'm always doing something for everybody in my house.

They call them competitions.
But believe me, they're wars.
And they often do lead to fights.
The emotions be very high.
They're very intense, very intense affairs.
But I guess that's what makes them fun.
Like a good movie...
if there's no emotion...
You don't enjoy it.
I don't talk too much about the ball kids because I want them to talk about me.
Because I haven't walked yet.
And it's like, well, William says,
"I want you to walk in my ball.
I want you to walk in my ball."
And I keep telling William, I say, "I'll walk when I walk."
"I'll walk when I want, not when you want.
I'll walk when I want."
And so far, I don't know when I'm gonna walk.
I'm thinking somewhat around the time of the legends ball.
But don't quote me on that.
I mean, it really causes hate, actually, between two individuals.
It's like a war on the floor.

Wait a minute, now.
Let's not get loud.
Now, David.
David. 
David.
That's the one thing that I find faulty with the balls.
After they've laid down these little categories, then they try to become a stickler for exact interpretation... merely a point to discredit the contestant.
Like in an Olympics where the Russian judge brought to the fact that the American coach had stepped onto the floor, and that was a disqualification for the contestant... just as picky as a ball.
So those little flaws like that... that's because that's a part of shade.
That's the idea...
knock them out if you can.
Get them any way you...
hit them below the belt.
It was typed out!
The second... where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Stop! 
No ball.
Shade comes from reading.
Reading came first.
Reading is the real art form of insult.
Now, you want to talk about reading?
Let's talk about reading.
What is wrong with you, Pedro?
Are you going through it?
You're going through some kind of psychological change in your life?
She went back to be a man.
Oh, you went back to being a man.
Touch this skin, darling.
Touch this skin, honey.
Touch all of this skin.
Okay?
You just can't take it.
You're just an overgrown orangutan.
You get in a smart crack, and everyone laughs and kee-kees because you found a flaw and exaggerated it... then you've got a good read going.
I am a person just like you.
You cut me, I bleed the same way you do.
I bleed the same color.
If it's happening between the gay world and the straight world,
It's more of an insult, a vicious slur-fight.
See, see? 
There go my sister right there.
She don't even want to even admit that she my sister.
She a bulldagger.
[ Laughter ]
But it's how they develop a sense of how to read.
That's my husband right there.
And that's my girlfriend right there.
They may call you a faggot or a drag queen.
You find something to call them.
But then when you are all of the same thing, then you have to go to the fine point.
In other words, if I'm a black queen and you're a black queen, we can't call each other black queens 'cause we're both black queens.
That's not a read.
That's just a fact.
So then we talk about your ridiculous shape.
Your fa... saggy face.
Your tacky clothes.
Let me see what you are...
spreading lies!
Let's see. 
Oh!
No paint!
Yes, it's paint!
It's paint!
No mother[Bleep] paint, girl!
What? 
She wears more makeup than my mother did!
Then reading became a developed form where it became shade.
Shade is "I don't tell you you're ugly, but I don't have to tell you because you know you're ugly."
And that's shade.

You could take the pantomime form of the vogue... this is what, generally, sometimes I do is I make my hand into a form like a compact or a makeup kit.
And I'm, like, beating my face with blush, shadows, or whatever, to the music.
Then, usually, I'll turn the compact around to face that person... meaning, like, almost like my hand is a mirror... for them to get a look.
Then I'll start doing their face, because what they have on their face right now needs a dramatic makeup job.

It's starting to make a name for itself, but I want it to be known worldwide, and I want to be on top of it when it hits.
I want to take voguing not to just Paris is burning, but I want to take it to the real Paris and make the real Paris burn.
That's what I want to do, and not just there, but to other countries as well.
My house name is Ninja, and I would really like to take my whole house and go to Japan...
And really let loose and do it and have them accept it there.
I want to be a big star.
Uh, known, generally, every corner of the world.
You know, maybe as a choreographer, a famous dancer, a singer, or all of them.
What the balls has to do with that, as far as the dance field, is maybe perfecting my craft a little better, to learn new things, new ideas, and bring them to the real world.
It's been really unbelievable, my life.
If I was to die today or tomorrow,
I could not say I've not had an exciting life.
I have had a fabu...
and I'm not rich, mind you.
Just imagine if I had the dollars.
Ooh, it'd be too much for the world.
If I had the riches and I had the fame, trust me, all of y'all in here would be rich...
'Cause I'm very generous.
You know, I can't...
I wouldn't enjoy having a whole lot of money, like being a millionaire and hoarding it, you know?
I'd share it with all my loved ones.
You know, I'd want them to have it, too.
We'd all have to go.
I'd want to charter a plane, and we all fly to Paris.
[ Orchestral music plays ]
O-p-u-l-e-n-c-e... opulence.
[ Laughter ]
You own everything.
Everything is yours.
This is white America.
Any other nationality that is not of the white set knows this and accepts this till the day they die.
That is everybody's dream and ambition as a minority... to live and look as well as a white person.
It is pictured as being in America.
Every media you have, from TV to magazines to movies to films...
I mean, the biggest thing that minority watches is what?
"Dynasty" and "the Colbys."
Um, "all my children," the soap operas.
Everybody have a million-dollar bracket.
When they showing you a commercial from honey grahams to crest or lestoil or pine-sol, everybody's in their own home.
The little kids for fisher-price toys, they're not in no concrete playground.
They're riding around the lawn.
The pool is in the back.
This is white America.
And when it comes to the minorities, especially black...
We, as a people for the past 400 years, is the greatest example of behavior modification in the history of civilization.
We have had everything taken away from us, and yet we have all learned how to survive.
That is why, in the ballroom circuit, it is so obvious that if you have captured the great white way of living...
Or looking...
Or dressing or speaking...
You is a marvel.
I think if I could just be on TV or film or anything,
I'd do that instead of the money.
Of course, I do want the money because I want the luxury that goes with it.
But...
I want to be wealthy.
If not wealthy, content, comfortable...
You know?
I want to be somebody.
I mean, I am somebody.
I just want to be a rich somebody. [ Laughs ]
Emcee: 
You ain't gonna tell me, you see her in the supermarket, and you're gonna say, "that's a hag."
Women don't go out of their way because they are women.
I went out my way because I wasn't, and I felt that I wanted to be the best I can be.
The Virginia slims girl is here.
This was not a game for me or fun.
This is something that I want to live.
She's here in person.
Hopefully, God willing, by 1988, I fully hope to become a full-fledged woman of the United States.
You look at all these models on the wall.
Every one of them are gorgeous.
Every one of them are beautiful.
I wish you could feel my heart rate now.
I really wish you could feel what's going on here.
Go!
Hold on! 
Thank you.
Come on, come on, come on, baby!
'I was now giving it everything.'
So at the top here there is a Buddha to road safety. 
Apparently.
Wouldn't it be brilliant if we got there and Jeremy's GT-R was buried in the middle of it?
"Watch this, I'm here..." "Oh, dear." "Bang."
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This way. 
Finally, I made it to to the Buddha's car park.
Victory is mine!
But that wasn't the finishing line.
Go where? 
Where?
Run! 
Come on, go, go, go!
Just leave it, leave it, leave it!
That's not a temple.
We were now converging on the Buddha up two different paths.
Are you sure we haven't overshot it?
Come on!
No!
Please, God...
don't let them be here.
HE PANTS HEAVILY
They aren't here.
A car just beat the Bullet Train.
That's Buddha!
This is the Buddha to road safety!
And this wall was 12th century, erm...so you remember from the lecture I was giving you...
Hi, guys! 
Oh.
Just interesting...how this is a different century to that.
Yeah. 
Yeah.
You ran up there as well? 
Oh, yeah.
Congratulations.
How long have you been here?
Really not long.
Genuinely? 
Honestly?
Three minutes 12 seconds.
That is so close.
Thanks, Buddha.
You looked after him.
Disappointed! 
Wait for it.
TRANSLATOR SPEAKS JAPANESE Which is? 
That's the Japanese...
For? "Oh, cock!"
Now, look, we do arrange those races so that we know they're going to be close, but even so.
That really was astonishing. 
Anyway, there's not much else to say now, except thank you, Tokyo, for being empty and thank you very much for watching.
See you next week, good night!
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

The eternal life... since the dawn of time countless fortunes have been spent in its pursuit, only to meet with the inevitable.
What would you give to live forever?
And be careful what you wish for.
My experiment began in the underground caverns outside the ruins of ancient Babylon.
Through some connections with the military
I contracted a team of mercenaries led by Captain Frank Sanders.
- We're close.
- It should be just ahead.
It?
Let's move.
They haven't a clue what they're about to encounter.
Thermographic studies indicate the presence of an advanced life form.
Stay close.
- Hey.
- You bitch.
It's a haunted place.
Get her!
Get down. 
Got her.
Shh shh, keep it quiet. 
Keep it quiet.
Shut her up.
- Quiet.
- Shut that bitch up!
Shh!
What is that?
At that moment Sanders and the being became one... the mixing of human blood with that of the gods.
Now that he's captured, the creature's D.N.A.
Will be extracted, analyzed and catalogued at a secure location.
Was that where I said it was?
I've got men down, Fibrian.
Captain Sanders said a monster touched...
I ordered that no one would touch it.
A monster, General?
No.
It's written in the sacred text... the uniting of angels with men.
Where the hell are you gonna put it, Doctor?
This thing gets loose... it's game over.
I know just the place.
And that's Phase One.
Thus begins Phase Two.
Well, it's early, Deborah, but everything seems just fine.
For the morning sickness.
- What is this?
- Reficul makes giving birth as easy as getting pregnant.
Oh, no.
You know how I feel about the whole pharmaceutical thing.
Yes, I know and I want you to continue with your organic regiment, but supplement it with this prescription.
Dr. Logan, I really don't think...
Uh uh uh, doctor's orders.
Dr. Feldman, pick up line one.
Dr. Feldman, line one.
Deborah, as long as we've known each other, have I ever steered you wrong?
Okay, fine. 
But I'll have you know, this is way out of character for me.
There.
You've been taking your vitamin supplementation?
Yes.
I hate to bring it up, but the baby's father...
Oh, not a matter of discussion, so yeah...
Deborah, I'm only thinking of the baby.
You know, a single birth can change the entire world.
And we're here for you every step of the way.
Thank you.
Every experiment requires a laboratory.
The perfect neighborhood...
lawn sprinklers, two-car garages and 401s... you never know what's just below the surface.
Frank Sanders's ex-wife Helen Green has found herself in a maze so intricate she couldn't find her ass with both hands.
Patience. 
I know.
Hello. 
No, she can't come to the phone.
We're in the middle of a birthday party.
Leave a message. 
I'll be sure she gets it.
Okay, hang on.
Coldwater Cafe, right?
Wednesday, 10:00.
I will huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your fucking house down.
Helen!
The creature's blood provided benefits I'd never imagined... healing qualities that became my fountain of youth.
Your usefulness to us is at at end.
What would you give for one more day of life?
- Oh, God.
- The universal question.
As a major stockholder in Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
Helen's knowledge of our research posed a threat to the project.
And sometimes that means having to gobble up their young.
Another time then.
Happy birthday.
- Let's take a ride.
- No.
- Yes.
- No!
Stephen!
Let me go.
Deborah is a fascinating case study.
Thinking herself to be a budding journalist, she goes about her business blissfully unaware that she is but a carefully supervised prototype.
But the programming is wearing off along with the rose-colored glasses.
I will scoop her up in a butterfly net.
Help me!
Help! 
Somebody help!
The boy was next in line.
Help me! 
Someone help!
The only fly in the ointment is Detective Alex Russo from a long line of Russos, a typical cop, part of a mop-up squad, always there after the crimes occur.
But his never-ending search for Melissa could be his undoing.
Good day, Alex.
Deborah, hi. 
How are you today?
- Hi, Mrs. Gamble.
- I didn't know you'd be back so soon.
I would have gotten your mail for you.
That's okay, Mrs. Gamble. 
Got it handled.
- Oh oh, Deborah.
- Yeah?
How's your mother?
She's really good, thank you.
Good.
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, the appointment went great.
Uh-huh.
Everything went fine.
Oh my God, school's great.
My thesis is gonna blow the lid off these F.D.A. Creeps.
Mm, one of my sources is this woman from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals.
I think we really hit it off.
Yes, Mommy, I'm fine.
The baby is fine.
The F.D.A. Is corrupt.
Everything is where it should be.
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Mommy.
Okay, I'll talk to you later. 
Kisses. 
Bye.
Speak of the devil.
Dr. Logan?
Mommy! 
Daddy!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Push me on the swing, Daddy.
I'll push the swing later. 
I promise.
Come on, baby.
Love you, Mommy. 
Love you, Daddy.
Edgewater.
Here comes the Kitty Kitty.
Kitty wants to play with you.
Meow. 
Pull my bow.
That's right.
Oh, you've been a bad boy today, honey, huh?
I'm gonna have to punish you.
Mm, bad.
Oh, is this your girl?
You could say that.
I could say whatever I want.
Mm, yeah.
This better be good.
All right, I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
- Go?
- Yes.
Oh, give me a spankie for the road.
One more.
Gosh, you're so hot.
It wasn't my call.
- Hey, Alex.
- What's up?
The call came in around 5:00.
5:00? 
I was right around the corner.
The blood comes up green.
Someone comes through the door...
Mr. Green's on the phone there...
The happy family never stood a chance.
It's an ancient Hebrew warning...
"Know your place."
They're back.
Hey, Detective, paramedics took the parents over to County Medical, but there's no sign of the boy.
They took him like they took Melissa.
Hey, Russo, where is your little Limey friend when you need him, huh?
We would have never decoded this if it wasn't for Arends.
Bullshit. 
That looks like a bunch of gang graffiti if you ask me.
Wrong.
When are you gonna let go of that conspiracy crap, huh, Russo?
About the time you wipe that frosting off your chin.
Hey, Professor Colbert, got a minute?
Oh, no.
No no no, not so fast.
Something's rotten at Edgewater, Professor.
Deborah, don't go there.
You and I both know they contribute a large percentage of this university's annual budget.
The almighty dollar, huh?
What, are you on the payroll too, Professor?
All you have are unsubstantiated claims bordering on slander.
Okay, look, if you can get me in there,
I swear I can get us the story of the millennium.
You've got to get me in there. 
Otherwise they're not gonna give me the time of day.
I need hard facts, solid research.
Oh, okay, you want hard facts.
How about 1967, a C.I.A. -sponsored experiment known as Project Often... toxicology, transmission and behavioral effects of drugs tested on... 
I'm sorry, what? 
Human subjects.
If you so much as accuse Edgewater of human test trials...
Please. 
Researchers paralyzed 64 Edgewater inmates using a neurological compound called cesanyl choline which suppresses breathing, Doctor.
It's like drowning. 
How about 1981 when they tested cloinen on elderly patients. 
Why would they do that?
I'm sure the list is endless, Miss Fielding, but I'm afraid if you had your way people would still be dying of smallpox
- or polio.
- Wow.
I took you for a serious journalist, and here you are with all this Area 51 crap.
Creative Writing's on the third floor.
I'm late for a lecture unless you have something else.
Yeah.
And Reficul is?
A replacement for spinal epidurals during childbirth.
- A maternity drug? 
- Mm-hmm.
Why would Edgewater want...?
I don't know, but Edgewater's patients are a "Who's Who?" Of government PhDs and linguists and experts in fields ranging from molecular biology to unarmed combat.
And yet Reficul is listed as a pregnancy drug in its I.P.O. Statement.
- God.
- Yeah.
That guy look pregnant to you?
Where did you get this disk?
Don't tell me it's that woman from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals.
Deborah, you can't use stolen material as evidence.
Look, what's going on here is nothing more than neural cosmetology... plastic surgery for the brain.
Ask for Dr. Neil Fibrian.
Mention Reficul and Captain Frank Sanders.
Come on. 
Please please please please please.
All right. 
Go on, get out of here.
Thank you.
You are an amazing human being.
Miss Crandall, get me Edgewater.
If I give you a shot of this, with your body weight, it will kill you dead.
So I'm gonna give you a break, you mutt.
I'm gonna give you a break.
I'm gonna let it go in through your skin.
Your skin's as smooth as a baby's ass.
There you go. 
Yeah.
That's right.
You are really something.
You are the heir apparent, aren't you?
But you're not. 
You're the stepbrother.
We're gonna take your daddy and chop him up and sell him by the pound.
Oh, yeah, we are.
There you go.
Yeah, fear. 
It's all fear.
How do you feel about coulrophobia?
Hmm?
How do you feel about clowns?
The minute man stood on his hind legs he was terrified.
We've been living with that every since.
We gotta shed light into the darkness of ignorance and abuse.
When I was at that crime scene it smelled like sulphur.
Sulphur, eh?
Then it really should take the game up.
The only game I'm good at is drinking.
You know, life can't be all theological essays, archeological digs and ancient code-cracking any more than your life can be.
Bring on the usual suspects.
What's wrong? 
Upsetting?
Can we get to the point, please?
More lessons on the Ancient Hebrew.
Another child missing, I presume?
You know, it took me weeks to find out what this ancient text really meant.
I doubt if there are 10 souls on earth who would know those symbols.
The text is from the Chiseled Tomb of the Nephilim... angels gone bad, a rather unsavory lot who bedded all the women and produced a new race of men.
And you believe in this crap?
Do you?
You smelled sulphur.
In any event, Nephilim owners today would be a nigh unstoppable force.
So I should watch my back?
And your step.
And, Alex, give up the Scotch.
Seems the long-standing feud between my loyal attack dog Barro and Russo is finally coming to a head.
Leaving so soon, Russo?
A coward dies many times before his death.
Fuck you, Barro.
The valiant die but once.
From soldier to Edgewater patient on to Gordian Labs C.E.O.,
Frank Sanders's rise was meteoric.
But his ego is eating him alive.
I am gonna flip this mutt.
Thank you for joining me today, gentlemen.
Hold on, please.
Colbert knows about Reficul.
What?
We should have killed the boy. 
According to you, bringing Deborah here was necessary for us.
"Us"? 
What do you mean, "us"?
Don't speak.
I'm back.
Gordian Labs stands at the forefront of pharmaceutical innovation.
With our I.P.O. Going public tomorrow, coupled with Reficul's F.D.A. Approval in less than two weeks our wonder drug will hit the marketplace between New York and Beijing.
Our investors reap the benefits of 20 years' worth of Gordian Labs' RD.
Thank you.
Listen to me.
Going public now will attract... too much goddamn attention.
Oh, that hurt.
You need me. 
We need each other.
I'm the one that extracted the D.N.A. From the creature.
Without me there's no Reficul.
Know your place, Doctor, lest your precious fountain of youth may suddenly run dry.
- You want it?
- Yes.
Thank you. 
By the way,
Deborah's smarter than you realize.
Let's hope not, for your sake.
You are so pathetic.
Your days are numbered, buster.
Hi, honey. 
I was just tidying up.
Hi, Mrs. Gamble.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Oh, your face looks so drawn, Deborah.
Have you lost weight?
No.
You know, I told your mother and father
I would take great care of you, Deborah.
Oh, good.
I'm sorry, how did you get in here?
Oh, you left the door unlocked.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Wow. 
Okay,
I don't mean to rush you off, but I've really got to get some stuff done.
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Okay, all right.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- There you go, sweetheart.
- Thanks.
You're doing such a good job.
You're not my mother.
Hey, you've reached Deborah. 
Leave a message and I'll call you back.
Hey, Deborah. 
It's Professor Colbert.
I spoke with Dr. Fibrian and mentioned Frank Sanders and, well, he said he'd make room for you on his schedule.
Thank you.
Deborah, it's Dr. Logan.
You missed our 4:00 again.
I thought we agreed we would meet once a week, for the baby.
Call me to reschedule.
I haven't heard from you.
Are you okay?
Have you been taking your pills?
You stay the hell away from me.
Deborah, I'm only thinking of the baby.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Listen, I know who you are.
I know what you did to me.
And I'm gonna go do something about it.
Oh, Mrs. Gamble, you should have checked the mail, yeah.
She came to maybe 20 minutes ago, just heard her son's missing, mentioned Edgewater a few times.
- Thanks.
- You got it.
Mr. Green, I'm Detective Russo.
My wife's not ready to see anyone right now.
I'm here to help you find your son, Mr. Green.
Who are you meeting at 10:00 at Coldwater Cafe?
I don't know. 
She's a friend of my wife's.
She called when the door blew open.
"Know your place."
Whoever took your son also took a little girl 16 years ago.
We don't know anything about that.
Reficul. 
Remember that.
Lower. 
What do you need now?
You, me, a moonlit beach, margaritas.
Gonna take more convincing than that.
Do me a favor, pull up Reficul and tell me what you get.
Gordian Labs to offer I.P.O.
Their drug Reficul is getting the F.D.A. Nod.
Phoenix Industries is doing their stage testing.
Oh, I read about this... a pill that replaces the epidural.
Do me a favor, print that up for me.
Okay.
There is no "us."
There's only me.
This boy is like a fat worm on a fishhook... makes one hell of a lure.
Stephen, where do you think you're going?
All right, guys, get over here.
Let's get this shit over with.
Let's get out of here!
- Daddy.
- Sweetheart.
Oh, please. 
Oh, please be okay.
Oh, please.
Oh, please be okay.
Oh my God, I'm sorry.
Opening these files... this isn't gonna bring your Dad back, Alex.
Your father was a great cop.
And this thing that you have with the Edge... it's getting in the way of you moving up the ranks.
I'm touched by your concern.
Russo, get in here.
Keep this shit up and Hummel gets the case.
"1989, on Edgewater grounds without a warrant;
1990, harassment, stopping employees' cars for questioning."
And the list goes on and on.
Let's get one thing straight... this town gets all the government subsidies it applies for.
Every school has new computers.
Not a pothole on the road.
And all our wage requests are greenlit.
A kid is missing.
The M.O. Matches the Sanders girl kidnapping to a tee.
Are you gonna tell me this has nothing to do with your old man?
My dad went into the Edge and came out in a bag.
The F.B.I. Investigation proved...
Proved nothing. 
A little girl goes missing, my father killed in the line of duty, and both of them were just so neatly swept under the rug.
You know why you're still a lieutenant after 14 years?
'Cause you just can't leave well enough alone.
But at least we have new computers, right, Captain?
Get the hell out of my office, Russo.
We're gonna need backup, Alex. 
Call it in.
We're out of our jurisdiction.
They took the girl. 
A man commits a crime on your watch... you are the jurisdiction. 
You got that?
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, son.
Hey, let's go.
Okay.
Russo.
Okay, I'll be right there.
- You couldn't keep him isolated?
- Don't look at me.
We called as soon as we could.
His folks are down the hallway.
Hey, Russo, you look like yesterday's meatloaf.
I feel like it too.
- I need to speak to your son.
- No no, Detective.
We have Stephen back now and we just want to move on.
Who are you meeting at Coldwater Cafe at 10:00 AM?
Tell me what I need to know to shut Edgewater down.
You be careful what you wish for, Detective.
Hey, Russo...
We got the woman who found the kid.
We found this in her car. 
What do you suppose she's got against...
Edgewater?
I'm Detective Alex Russo.
What's your business at Edgewater?
I'm sorry, is this what I get for being a good Samaritan?
I bring an injured kid to the hospital...
I go to jail.
You know, if I'm not charged with anything you can't hold me.
Where did you get the information in this manuscript, Miss Fielding?
I don't divulge my sources.
Is that so?
A little F.Y. I...
I can lock you up for 72 hours just for shits and giggles.
Wow.
So much for "protect and serve," huh?
I got it from a woman at Phoenix Pharmaceuticals.
What do you care?
I'm here to help you, Miss Fielding.
I'm on your side.
Really?
And what side would that be exactly?
Did you say "Alex Russo"?
So you're Detective Michael Russo's kid.
Do you want to tell me what happened to your dad or would you like me to do it?
The door!
You know what? 
Walk away.
That's fine.
I'm a little too much woman for you anyway.
Love a man in a uniform.
I'll be here.
- Hey, Tammy.
- Yeah?
Give me a background check on Deborah Fielding, please.
Okay.
Bishop County Sheriff's office.
Parsons here.
Uh-huh.
I see.
I'll take care of the girl.
You make sure Russo stays out of the way.
And be blunt.
You follow?
Mm-hmm.
The crime scene at the Green home begs the question...
what is the connection between Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
Gordian Labs,
Edgewater's development of Reficul and Helen Green?
Could Phoenix be nothing more than a dummy corporation tucked away in a hidden room?
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.
You're getting warmer, Detective.
You're good.
You're free to go.
Thank you.
- Gail.
- Hey.
Hey, was there a lady in here, maybe in her 50s
- looking for someone?
- No.
About 15 minutes ago, though, there was a young girl, 20-ish, blonde, pretty.
She just left.
She...
I could be 20-ish, blonde and pretty.
Salaam, Russo.
You just freed a key witness in a kidnapping.
Did you hold the door open for her too, Captain?
Now why on earth would a man in my position want to hinder a journalist's First Amendment rights?
How many potholes are you gonna have filled on this one, huh, Captain?
You have no idea what you're up against.
I know one thing... this case just fell under my jurisdiction.
And if Edgewater cut you any checks you'd better get to the bank.
- Russo.
- What?
What's wrong?
I'm done with this place. 
I quit.
Okay, well, look, I ran the backgrounds on Deborah Fielding...
F.B.I., Interpol... everything.
Nothing comes up. 
It's like she doesn't exist.
She's a ghost.
It's the Greens' statement on the attack.
Thanks.
Where's Russo? 
I'm supposed to give him this lab work for the Green investigation.
Oh, I'll take care of that. 
Good job.
- Can I have your name, please?
- Deborah Fielding.
Oh, Miss Fielding, we've been expecting you.
Proceed through the gate.
This is all about meditation and sanity as opposed to delusion.
All right, who wants to finish this?
You want to finish it?
Okay, Norm, you are delusional.
No eating the clay. 
If you finish this right
I'm gonna let you go home. 
He's gonna go home.
Okay, go ahead, Norm. 
It's all yours.
- You're lost?
- I don't know.
- Maybe I can help.
- Maybe you can.
Are you Deborah Fielding?
I am.
Allow me to introduce myself...
No, I know who you are, Dr. Fibrian.
How?
Well, I've read pretty much every article you've ever done on higher brain function and the effects of neurological drugs on patients with compromised immune systems.
- I'm flattered.
- Okay.
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Oh.
Buon giorno.
You're an investigative journalist, aren't you?
- Of sorts.
- Yeah.
Andiamo.
Please.
This is our reception area.
I love that perfume you're wearing.
They're gonna have to check your jacket and bag.
You know, I just did a workshop on digging up the dirt, yes.
Psychiatric hospitals are not the house of horrors that most visitors imagine, I'll tell you that.
Well, you could have fooled me.
How so?
Avery, is my docket clear?
Your schedule's clear, Neil.
Let me see. 
Good good.
Would you like some tea?
- Sure. 
Why not?
- Good.
Make sure, Avery, that Naomi takes her medicine, all right?
- I'll see to it.
- Thank you very much. 
Follow me.
- Your tea.
- Thank you.
- Tea to your liking?
- It's perfect, thank you.
I usually bring guests to my office first, but I thought we'd tour the ward.
Doctor, do you mind if I record our conversation?
Dr. Neil Fibrian,
Director of Psychiatric Medicine,
Chief of Staff at Edgewater Psychiatric Hospital,
Bishop County, California.
How's that?
- That was very good.
- Good.
- Your professor...
- Colbert.
Yeah, Colbert, he called me about your visit.
He said it's something about Reficul.
Well, it's just one of a long list of drugs being engineered here, isn't it, Doctor?
Is this gonna be an interrogation, Miss Fielding?
Are you gonna deny that Edgewater is an incubator for government drug design?
Have it your way. 
Interrogation it is.
Deny it? 
I revel in it.
Every drug on the market, prescription or otherwise, eventually gets government funding in its development.
And what exactly do you mean by the word "development"?
- What do you think I mean?
- I don't know. 
You tell me.
Wouldn't you agree that the creation of a drug for the better of mankind as a whole... that all means should be explored in the advancement of the human genome?
Oh, please.
I'm sure that every mad scientist has used the exact same rationalization in their work.
How sophomoric of you.
I'm sorry?
I can assure you that nothing that happens at Edgewater could be construed as mad.
Yeah, listen, I'd like to show you another part of the ward.
Basta.
Listen, your professor told me of a Captain Frank Sanders.
Who is Frank Sanders to you, Miss Fielding?
Are you feeling all right, Miss Fielding?
Fine.
Now about Edgewater.
When we're done with the tour you'll know everything.
So I'm not gonna be allowed to see your patients?
I wouldn't say that.
You were coming here expecting to find straitjackets and rubber rooms, weren't you?
But you know what?
I think it's something far more personal.
Wasn't it?
There's no place like home.
Dr. Fibrian!
Dr. Fibrian.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, God.
Hello.
Hi, this is Detective Russo with the Bishop County Police Department. 
Do you have a student
- by the name of Deborah Fielding?
- Yes.
I'm just going over some names across my desk.
I was hoping we could meet.
Is there anything wrong?
It's in regards to Edgewater.
Yes yes, that would be fine.
Come on by.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello?
Goodbye, Doctor.
I'm Detective Russo with the Bishop County Police Department.
Now why on earth would we need detectives here in Bishop?
You'd be surprised, Miss...
Oh, I'm Mrs. Gamble.
You know, as good as things are going here in Bishop, someday soon we won't need detectives here at all.
Is this Deborah Fielding's apartment?
OH, yes, this is her apartment.
Is she okay?
I just need to take a quick look around.
I get my ass kicked by Betsey Crocker.
Mrs. Gamble the watcher, you've outlived your usefulness.
Know your place.
A girl after my own heart.
When a child dissects a frog for his biology class, would any sane, rational person say that this exercise could be construed as evil?
Feeding time, eh, Doctor?
Yes yes yes yes.
It feels her, wants her.
Yeah, like a spider devouring its young.
It's not what it was when it came to earth.
Nor am I.
You're the ears. 
You're the eyes.
You're the link... the link.
There it is.
What are you up to, Doctor?
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Ahh.
Feels like everything's unraveling, doesn't it?
Doesn't it? 
Yeah yeah.
By the way, how does Deborah know your name?
You tell me.
Miss Fielding, are you with us?
Miss Fielding, Miss Fielding, are you with us?
Hello?
You don't mind if I tape our conversation?
I thought we might start with why are you here?
If I don't answer, are you gonna shock me again like you did Katherine Sanders?
Oh, God.
You don't mind if I call you Deborah, do you?
Sure.
Let's be friends.
I'll take a cup of drugged tea with two sugars.
Why are you here, Deborah?
Stick it up your...
Oh, God.
You're pregnant, young lady.
I suggest that you protect your fetus.
Tell me your business here.
Convince me you're not the F.D.A., so mired in their own bureaucracy, it takes them a year just to pass gas.
You're here why?
I'm here for the truth.
The truth?
Would you like to know the truth about your mother?
How about that?
She lives just outside of Bishop.
See, see, I don't have a mother.
And my father's not a...
what do you have in there?
A bank supervisor?
He was brought here for treatment.
And you want me to think that that's where I grew up, but that's not my house.
And I don't know the woman in that photograph.
And I'm not the baby in that photograph.
Oh, God.
So whose file do you have there, Doc?
Why don't we switch places?
Eine zigarette, bitte.
You received a package. 
What was in it?
Girl Scout cookies.
As much as I dislike other people's pain...
A disk.
- A disk?
- Yeah.
What happened to you when you saw what was on that disk?
Did your life pass in front of your eyes,
Deborah Fielding?
I'm not Deborah Fielding.
You're right. 
You're not Deborah Fielding.
She was a patient of mine.
She had a flesh-eating bacteria on her eyes.
I had to slice her eyelids off and record her sleep deprivation for the military in pursuit of my Mad Scientist's degree.
It was so bad I wanted to commit suicide, but I did not want to suffer the humiliation of autopsy.
When your mother calls do you feel the need to pick up the photo album that you keep beside your bed, similar to this one perhaps?
You know 15 languages, in fact.
You know how much time we invested in you, all for the advancement of the human genome?
Let me ask you something.
This... the answer, please.
People are gonna come looking for me.
They are.
Why are you here?
Oh, please please, stay away from me.
Oh, God.
You came to me, Deborah.
Don't call me that.
What did you do to me, you psychotic piece of shit?
Let me ask you something.
Who is Captain Frank Sanders to you?
Hmm? 
What is he to you?
He's my father.
So he is.
But it isn't your love for him that brought you back, is it?
No.
I had to know the truth.
He stole you from your mother, brought you to me.
I created you with his blessing.
He gave you up to it, flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood.
How can a father do such a thing?
You hate him, don't you?
Know your place.
What will you do when you see him again, Melissa?
What will you do?
Kill him.
Russo.
Russo, thank God. 
I've had a bitch of a time trying to reach you.
- Go ahead.
- You won't believe this... remember that green blood sample I showed you?
- Yeah.
- It's blood, human blood.
- Stay with me on this one.
- I'm here.
The blood sample I took is infected.
It's D.N.A. Sequence's been overwritten by something that mimics a virus.
So the guy's sick.
Whatever it is replicates at a rate faster than H.I.V.
Mental capabilities, physical strength... everything that makes us who we are gets radically changed.
A new race of men.
Yeah, but instead of happening over the next couple hundred years, it could be overnight.
Thanks, Dennis.
Got a 187 reported at Bishop College... a Professor Richard Colbert. 
All units respond.
Copy that.
- Hello?
- Tammy, are you sitting down?
I am now.
I've waited 15 years for this.
Deborah Fielding is Melissa Sanders.
Sanders is slowly piecing together the puzzle.
He and the creature's usefulness are at an end.
Fortunately, in their treatments
I thought ahead and implanted a time lock in their D.N.A., making them weak and helpless, their fates so intertwined.
It was you all along.
You sent the package to Deborah.
You altered her D.N.A.
What did you have to gain from this, Doctor?
You exposed us to a great deal of danger.
You cannot catch a falling knife.
Your Gordian Laboratories I.P.O. Is in the crapper because of your greed and your vanity.
Oops.
You know what?
You are numero freakin' zero.
Deborah's all alone now.
All she has is me.
Do you understand?
Melissa is awakening to the fact that her entire life has been but a carefully scripted illusion, complete with fake parents, false memories and artificial surroundings.
Nephilim.
Who's there?
We don't want any visitors right now.
Open the door, Mr. Green.
I need to speak to your son.
Detective...
It's not a request.
Who is it, Marcus?
Helen Green...
How can I help you?
...or is it Sharon Sanders?
Excuse me?
I need the truth.
I never stopped looking for your daughter.
When did you?
My daughter?
That's why you didn't want to see me at the hospital that night.
That's why your husband mentioned Reficul, hoping that I could do something.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop the bullshit, Mrs. Green.
The handwriting is identical.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- You greenlit their testing.
They took Melissa and both of you were under their thumbs.
- That's enough. 
Get out.
- It's not enough!
I didn't hurt Melissa!
You knew it was a bad drug and you gave it a pass.
They made me.
I wanted to expose them.
You have no idea what they can do.
She's been through enough.
And so has my son.
They haven't done anything to deserve this.
It only takes one person to start a chain reaction.
Double a penny a day.
Would you rather have a million dollars or double a penny every day for a month?
It's just a penny, right?
One becomes two.
Two becomes four.
At the end of a month you have 1.3 billion pennies in 31 days.
There's a garbage chute.
It's behind the hospital.
There are trees stretching over the fence.
You shouldn't go back there.
I just love a good family reunion.
All the world is a stage, Melissa.
Let's see how you play dead, sweetheart.
- Dad.
- Melissa, behind you.
Get him.
En garde!
I'm coming to get you, Russo.
You ready for round two, esse?
It's all been lies.
Come to Papa.
You're mine.
You're mine. 
You're mine.
Honey.
We have to get out of here.
We're in danger.
Remember?
No matter how far apart we are, in our hearts we'll always be together.
I love you.
I love you too, Daddy.
Daddy?
Daddy.
We have to go.
You hate him, don't you?
What will you do when you see him again, Melissa?
What will you do?
Know your place.
We have to go.
Ah, like father like son.
Hmm? 
Yeah.
Officer, did you ask yourself... why did I take
Stephen Green, the brother?
What could be revealed that's been hidden behind these walls for decades?
An immortal... that can slice your throat right here right now.
Oh, yes.
For what?
For you.
For Melissa.
Oh, yeah.
For happy ever after.
I was talking to God just the other day and He said to me that people be like lemmings, throwing themselves off cliffs, landing on the rocks below, the screaming foam that cannot die.
Are you okay?
Sad news today in Bishop...
Frank Sanders, the CEO of Gordian Labs was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted stab wound.
The police are investigating, but at this time no foul play is suspected.
This comes at a critical time for Gordian Labs, as they await their initial IPO.
We'll have more on the story at 11:00.
Baby.
Hi, Mom.
Thank you.
Hi.
Every experiment requires a laboratory.
The perfect neighborhood...
lawn sprinklers, two-car garages and 401s... you never know what's just below the surface.
How are y'all doing? 
It's a real scorcher, ain't it?
- Sure is.
- There you go.
Yeah, it's a real scorcher.
Love is a dog from hell.
And so the experiment continues.
On to Phase Three... 
Reficul, extracting it like pollen, like killer bees.
And who do I meet at the other end?
Someone like me.
"Reficul" spelled backwards is...
Oh, go back to sleep.

KEITH
Coaching tennis 2. 8:45 ...
I was thinking about what you said about achieving your goals.

Hold on.
Then you need to convert the mass of them all for the mass of metal.
Sure. 
So would 0.01731 to 0.0350 oxygen.
- So, we molybdenum?
- Molybdenum? 
What is this?
- You will have to find out.
- But you already know the answer.
What, you are boring.
I have to go back to 15:00.
Why the rush?
We are here, a yellow Carangas and before us, a lot of opportunities.

A place, choice.
Choose back to the laboratory, work on molybdenum.
I can not concentrate, driving in a place so it will not work.

Now we discover that their oxidation with 10 of oxygen.

Accountant? 
Seller?

Manager of a telephone company.
It is not as good at reading the mind.
Why not try hard.
Imagine him behind a pile of paperwork, a call the other every day.
He hates his job.

So he botou all faith in their education.
Night after night, then you do it right.

Thank you.
Whatever.

Why not speak the truth?
Only a few are enjoying hours with your partner laboratory.

Me and my dad.
- It is attached to your father?
- Hold the bumper.
It?
He is the pre electronic ignition.
I need him.
So, this truck ...
would be their "thing" special.
- It is my passion.
- Interesting.
You are so talented Keith, has the potential to study, because you lose your time with the drug of truck?
Do not say that, but ... until the truth.
Do not listen to her, Mama.
You are jealous.
So, she is his girlfriend.
Look, your time is up.
Gotta go. 
None of bowling.
Continue, stop at the corner.
He is punctual.
Admire this in a man.
Time to move the night awake, baby.
Shut up and drive.
Cool way to find her boyfriend: well sexy.

- Keith, get up!
- I'm sinking with Natalie Anderson, 
- Keith, come on.
- We are going down ...
- Keith, go!
- And she is saying "Keith stop." 
- Keith, what doing?
Keith, quick!
- Keith, damn!
- "Keith, get up."
Keith, let's go!
Keith, stop the truck!
What was that?
Are you crazy?
Do not play well, might end up dying!
Not to mention what may happen to my truck.
Oh, of course!
I wanted to fall?
- Neither came close.
- Absolutely.
- Do not know anything.
- I have not come up with their nonsense.
Iknowverywellwhat hedid.
Good night, partner.
Take care, all right?

Sorry, but we do not give this information.

You will have to ask for Mr. Mailesem.

It would be nothing.
Sorry, I can not.
Where is it?
Why does not appear?
'm Trying to find him, but nobody league.
Hey, Keith is in a difficult phase.
- Difficult as?
- Thank you.
- It's all I know.
- We can not do anything?
- I knew it would be a bad idea.
- What?
- What?
- Make partnership with you.
But the choice was random.
He chose me?
Keith chose me?
Will assure that your notes.

Morning Walt, thanks.
Hi partner. 
Thanks for the notes.
Without them, it would have taken bomb.

- Two weeks?

Been here all day?

Yes, you did.
Me ... and finally to you.

Without games, Keith.
I hate you counter, but never played Miss. 
Anderson.
Where you been?
I was depressed, or something?
Depression? 
Sure, sometimes.
The girls love ...
- To speak seriously, Keith.
- Why?
It does not work.
So I explain.
What?
- Having trouble?
- I do not know the half.
- Hi, Raff.
- What's happening?
- His jacket.
- You like it? 
I made it at the mall.
- Raff, he brought was cold.
- What, not think he going to believe, huh?
You know Raff, the jacket served to protect from rain, but if you stay quiet, find such a promise for you ...
- I'm talking to you.
- Do not be angry with me, does not fill the place, never created a job.
- What the hell!
- Raff! 
It's just a jacket.
- It's just a jacket.
- Lie.
Hold on Raff . 
Marquez, was kidding.
Raff. 
Raff!
- Just one coat?
- Sure!
- Is that it?
- Absolutely!
- What is. 
Raff.
- I go for class.
Everything is a big joke for you, right?
I do not know, I do not know of anything else.
Why I chose to be its partner?
- I?
- Do not lie. 
Miles told me.
Walter Miles is the CIA, do not trust him.
- Where do you live? 
- How?
- Where do you live? 
You lied to me.
- All lost, partner?
- Lied about everything.
Because I have some pills good that you can take.
But I am sure that already know that.
KeithZeterstrom, Estrada Carlson, 15. 
I can not understand, has always been one of the best students.

- It was a way to achieve.
- You made a mistake.
- You are under great pressure,

- You will be right there, missy.
Natalie!
What?
The lighthouse was red.
- Oi.
- Oi.
I brought his 14th test of math.
Thank you.
- You all right?
- Great.
- I want to tell me?
- Effects of some medicines.
Nat, broke the lock of Keith.
What we were looking for?
Cool, I'm sure that everyone are mock me.
I just want to help you.
Keith is a loser, is jealous, trying to make you fight.
- This is ridiculous!
- Raff is pissed.
You talk to him?
- No, not that Nat ..
- If boss.
Keithisajerk, why are you doing all this? 
To leave.
- Natalie!
- I would be alone again,
- I see you in training.
- Nat, I am not ready.
Natalie . 
Natalie.
Natalie!
Damn ...
He said that the people there was talk later.
- What?
- Nothing. 
I have trained.
Whatever it is, can talk me, right, Natalie?
- Nothing to you.
- Why do with Keith?
- That's me.
- So it is with me too.
because we are together, if you've noticed.
- I need time.
- If you want to go to that house on the lake,
- Turn to my uncle today.
- The people we talk.
Youcrazy!
God!
Oi.
- You are the father of Keith?
- Yes.
Keith.
Keith!
One minute.
- He has brothers or sisters?
- Just the two of us.
Sorry, he does not want to see you now.
All right.
Even so, thanks.
I do not ... 
I do not mind which will be next year.
I do not mind, it is crazy.
God. 
I just want to know it will be with you.
I do not understand what 're doing.
It seems senseless, every time you ...
Just seems meaningless, but when I'm with you is different.
I do not know why.
So it should bowling.
- You know, with pins and everything.
- It is I should.
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Maybe.
- Go to school tomorrow?
- I do not know.
- I do not know of anything else.
- Why?
I mean, a guy like I with a truck,
I have to be moving.
- Stop.
- I am not of those who are tied.
- Shut up.
- Has Raff.
Raff is a nice guy, good for you.
We should remember everything.
- Get off!
- You have to do, partner.
If you can not find combinations, what we expect?
- His average fell 15 points, last month.
- Great.
- This is perfect.
- Talk to Dr. Toning, is a big guy in UTTA.
No, what I have to do is to talk to a doctor to a letter, saying I was sick.
- But was not sick.
- It is a fellowship of 10 thousand dollars.
It is not my fault that I want to go to university most expensive of the universe.
- Duke is the best ...
- Why is dismissing both?
Although neither did the other applications.
- Honey, do not.
- They do not want to do.
There are thousands of schools, I could get a job.
- Or something.
- Do not have to compromise.
If you focus on it, we can get the bag again.
Maybe I do not want back.
Perhaps not want to play tennis six hours per day.
Perhaps he is tired of these stupid 10 years. 
I never thought occurred that?
Honey, there is some reason to give up his dream now.
- You are even thinking about me?
- Are we in June, it is too late.
He is right, everything it is primed.
- Hey, not finished yet.
- Get back here!
Oi.
- We know, I was with Keith.
- Oh, hi.
- How is Keith?
- Actually I do not know.
I have not seen him much.
Still with that boy, Billy?
Billy died.
- Can I help you, sir?
- $ 15. 
Pump 3, please.
What?
Sorry.
- As Keith knew him?
- Have chemotherapy together.
- So, was your doctor?
- Therapist.
I was ...
He will be fine, right?
He is very ill?
Tell me.
Thought you knew.
Really sorry.
Keith?
Keith.
Please leave.
Keith, come on. 
Open the door!
Tell me, please.
Keith.
- Thanks for calling.
- Sorry, did not quite right.
Yes, and? 
Have you ever thought about everything?
Raff, we had good times, I like you.
- Then why are you doing this?
- It has a lot going on,
- We can just leave like that?
- No. 
Not really.
I can not find the CD, He then picked up later.
Yes, yes, then.
I have heard that before.
I was not walking away from you, complicate things.
- You curl up.
- Want to know what's going on?
I know what happened, okay? 
Left that kid mess with your head.
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, of course.
- You have no idea what is talking.
- I know, if I speak.
- Stop!
- What is thought?
What the hell thought that I trade by that idiot?
Stop!
You know, just like the best for you, that very bad things happen to people.
I pray to God that never happen to you.
Welcome, bad girl.
All right, ladies and gentlemen please, cease its reports on my desk, sure you have cleaned well their tables, which were dirty.
Or lose points on the test.
If you have things missing, I immediately sought.
So, make sure that ...
Four test tubes, three pipettes ... and a number of nozzles bunsen.
Okay, everything seems be in order.
Keys.
Natalie, keys.
It is the end of chemistry, as we know it.
It's a damn good actor.
As far as I know, this is a beautiful goodbye.
Excuse me.
Do not worry Walter, she everything was talking to me.
Hi, the odd man is here.
He said something about bowling?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Why tell me?
- Everyone will know sooner or later.
Just as class, a few steps forward.
- Always a joke.
- It is a stage, will soon pass.
At least it was not for sympathy the boy sick.
That was not fair.
It is fair to Duke?
It is fair to Europe?
Right now I can not go to London, is that fair?
Bowling ... is what I can.
Bowling.
- We are not going to bowling.
- Why?
Let's save.
Turn left.
- Where do we go?
- The sky is the limit.
Never ahead, I will not start now.

What are we doing?
Really?
- This is goodbye.
- It is not okay.
Come on, Zetterstrom, you can.
Sure. 
Wake up, Natalie.
Do not see what's going on here?
You have a wonderful life, and I got shit.
I hate their fate.
I want to overthrow you, wants to see her suffer like me and it was exactly what I did.
Now, as it was for a farewell?
- Very omega.
- Actually, Anderson, you screwed.
Screwed you whole.
So I screwed?
So what?
I. ..
I made love with you.
Try again, try again!
I had it all planned, so who cares?
Probably this is good, life is a drug that.
And you know, and was even worse.
And you are so ... wonderful.
- I ...
- What?
What?
I just wanted a little over time.
I have to say that was the worst that ever happened to me.
Goodbye partner.
I will keep you, to leave.
I do not care how much time we have.
Stop the stupid jokes.
I will call.
If you turn to the left, begins to fail then rotate back.
Sure.

Good evening.
Good evening, good evening.
Hello, chaps.
Thank you for coming.
Now then, we have a long way to go, so...er...keep your powder dry.
Righty-ho...settle down, now.
1 ...2...3... # l'm mad about the boy
# l know it's stupid to be mad about the boy # l'm so ashamed of it, but must admit
# The sleepless nights I've had about the boy
# On the silver screen
# He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
# Although I'm quite aware
# That here and there are traces...
of the cad about the boy
# And Lord knows, I'm not a fool girl # l really shouldn't care
# Lord knows, I'm not a schoolgirl # ln the flurry of her first affair
# Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity of misery and joy?
# l'm feeling quite insane and young again
# And all because I'm mad about the boy
# l'm feeling quite insane and young again
# And all because I'm... # ...mad about the boy #
- She's the first lady racer.
- But she didn't actually win.
She crossed the line first.
It's so exciting.
Not nearly as exciting as crossing your mother.
I think we can all ignore that.
Oh, what is that man doing?
Jackson!
- Madam?
- What did I tell you?
Put the camellias by the front door before the guests arrive!
- Furber.
- Madam?
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling pruning and send it to Mrs Holborough who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton for dinner, which you'll fetch, Marion.
But Reverend Burton has asked me to drain the font.
- My hands are clearly full.
- l'll go.
Uncle George has posted the most grizzly clippings of the Valentine's Day Massacre!
Hilda.
Seven terrified men cut down in a hail of automatic gun fire!
Made worse by the strays that came to lap the curdled blood.
- Hilda...
- The Devil Dogs! 
The Hounds of Hell!
The leg of lamb! 
Now.
Why we try and marry her off to gentry when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.
Seating. I'm putting Sarah on your left and Philip on your right, so please try and make an effort to be civil.
Right...
I shall go and brush up on my very small talk.
It might be an awkward meal.
For all we know Sarah's grazing in greener pastures.
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats in the South of France with his floozy?
No. 
We'll keep the home fires burning until his highness wanders home.
Hmm. 
Like father did?
Yes. 
Like your father did.
I've got news, everybody!
- You all right, sir?
- No. 
Are you?
- Coping, sir.
- Hear, hear. 
Well done.
Well done? 
They look like they're waiting for a firing squad.
- Can't you make them more relaxed?
- Last meal and a cigarette, perhaps?
I can't believe it. 
You'll never guess.
Houdini escaped the Chinese water torture only to die of a burst appendix.
How ghastly!
Oh, and Mother's got a telegram.
"Mr and Mrs Whittaker". 
Your mother.
What's it say, Father?
Perhaps your mother should read this first.
Oh! 
That stupid, stupid, stupid boy!
What's happened?
Has there been an accident?
- lt's John, he's married that f-f-f...
- Francophile?
- F-f-f...
- Photographer?
- Pharmacist?
- Why are you smirking?
Deploying a smile. 
One member of this family may actually be happy.
Don't be absurd! 
We don't know anything about this woman. 
Furber!
Furber!
- Oh, not again!
- Madam.
Lord have mercy.
Mister John is coming home with his...
with his wife.
Yes. 
Their bags have just arrived.
Congratulations, Madam.
I'll be the judge of that. 
Clear up this mess and get Cook to send up a ham.
- This is from Dover. 
They'll be half way.
- Yes, Furber. 
Dress the mutton as ham.
Very sharp, don't cut yourself.
John married the floozy.
How exciting!
# A room with a view and you
# And no one to worry us
# No one to hurry us through ...this dream we found #
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.
Oh, Lord, it's enormous.
So, I lied about gingerbread hedges and obese little children.
- How hard to swim is the moat?
- Smoke and mirrors, darling.
Smoke and mirrors.
Oh, by the by, smoking...don't.
Apparently it wilts the azaleas.
- That makes no sense. 
Speak English.
- All will be revealed, darling.
Oh, give me back the wheel of my car.
I'm going back to Detroit!
How romantic!
Here they come! 
Oh, Furber!
Mister John and his wife are about to arrive.
- l can't see them.
- Your tunnel vision.
Ooh!
- Smile, Marion.
- l don't feel like smiling.
You're English, dear. 
Fake it.
The prodigal son returns in a blaze of gravel.
Father! 
You shaved.
Welcome, Madam.
You look gorgeous.
It's so lovely to see you.
Oh, darling. 
Sorry, sorry!
This is my wife, Larita.
Mrs Whittaker, the pleasure is all mine.
Oh, you're American.
- And very welcome. 
Jim Whittaker.
- This is my father.
I fought alongside many of your countrymen, Larita, and I must say it's an honour to have a comrade in the family.
Thank you.
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.
- Far from it.
- And my two little blisters.
Hilda and Marion.
Aren't you the woman who won the Grand Prix?
First place, before disqualification.
Apparently you need chest hair to change gears in Monaco.
I saw you in the paper.
I cut your head out. i could just die!
Furber, that suitcase to the drawing room, and do be careful.
Marion... 
Golly, you're not a bit like what we imagined.
Somewhat older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.
Before the frostbite sets in... I'm looking forward to getting acquainted with the mother of my "Panda".
You'll find me quite uncomplicated, I'm afraid.
Oh! 
What are you doing?
Carrying you over the finish line.
Venus de Milo meet my Venus Detroit.
Oh, hello.
Mother's turned our old nursery into a boudoir.
I wouldn't exactly call it a boudoir, Hilda.
Marvellous. 
All those grubby memories of Little Johnnie.
We had no time to raid the hothouse.
I only hope we can make you comfortable.
Don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.
- Aren't we, Johnnie?
- Of course.
And for our next surprise...
What on earth is that?
His master's voice!
A wedding gift from us to you all.
How divine! 
You should've got married years ago!
# ...another June, another sunny honeymoon
# Another season, another reason for making whoopee... #
Come on, little blister. 
Twirl for me.
Oh, a Continental education.
Not all of us have been so fortunate.
An emotional depiction of the French postal service, Mrs Whittaker.
Come now, not Mrs Whittaker.
It's "Mother" now.
I don't think we're quite ready for that yet.
Since time is so clearly against us, why don't you show Larita up to the nursery?
Dinner's at 8:00.
- You didn't tell them?
- One bombshell at a time, darling.
That's not fair! 
Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?
A few days?
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family and what do I get in return? 
A few days!
Look at her. 
What am I supposed to do with the bauble of a woman?
- Hang her?
- l think she's splendid.
- Do you, Hilda? 
Well, we can all relax.
- She's not what I expected.
She's exactly what I expected.
- Surely not exactly? 
She wasn't drunk.
- Oh, very funny, Jim.
- Reduce this to the burlesque.
- She looks so expensive!
- Very.
- Hmm. I like her.
Yes, Jim. 
We all know what you like.
Mother!
Oh, we have all been sent to our "wombs".
- And so toasty.
- Economics in action.
She keeps half the house closed to save on heating.
That explains the frosty reception.
Well, darling. 
Let me warm you up.
- Well?
- She's lovely, I'm very proud of you.
Thanks, Father.
John? 
How long is a few days?
Mother, Larita and I would like to find a home in London.
- But this is your home.
- A home of their own.
But Panda, we need you here.
Since you went off around the Riviera, we've had to let go of six more people.
If you'd just listened to me and taken on some machinery.
Wouldn't that be a good idea? 
I could run the entire estate single-handedly.
Congratulations on your insight and your spontaneity.
Sarah and Philip are coming to dinner tonight, and I have got a table plan that will take the League of Nations to unravel.
- Tonight? 
That's absolutely splendid!
- Don't be so fickle in your affections.
Sarah might not be as accommodating as you expect.
Codswallop. 
She'll be delighted.
If mother was so desperate for her hand in marriage, she should've asked herself!
Strange as it may seem, I agree with your sister.
I think you're wrong.
On certain things, yes. 
Call her.
- Really?
- Really.
Really! 
If Edgar were here, he'd do the manly thing.
What? 
Run away?
Here they come!
And the chequered flag goes to...
Fast work, John!
I should've written, but it happened so fast, I didn't know where l was.
In Larita's arms, it seems.
- Please don't be disappointed.
- Of course I'm disappointed.
But tell me you're happy, and I'll tell you you're forgiven.
# You're the top, you're Mahatma Gandhi! 
#
Panda, don't break out the brandy just yet.
The hell we're not.
- Have I missed something?
- Let sleeping cows stand.
Oh, you plonker!
Rule one, push sleeping cow.
Rule two, get out of the way.
Rule three, remember rule two.
Sarah!
It's so lovely to see you.
I hear your poor father is not having a good day.
I'm afraid not. 
He sends his love.
You are a jolly good sport, turning up like this, that's all I can say.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.
Yes. 
Excellent for musical comedy.
Hilda!
- l hear the cow's in a terrible way.
- l've sent flowers.
And did she eat them?
Touche!
Good evening to you all.
Nobody told me tonight was fancy dress!
Then why have you come as the village idiot?
I think I'm snagged.
Let me help you with that.
Holy mother!
Panda? 
You're forgiven...tenfold.
Sarah Hurst, I'd like to introduce my wife, Larita Whittaker.
Gosh, I do like the sound of that.
Sarah...finally.
- Johnnie talks about you constantly.
- How very annoying for you.
- l hope we can be friends.
- We already are. 
Congratulations.
Er...
I'd like to be friends, too.
- Larita, my tiresome brother...
- The dishonourable Philip Hurst.
Charmed, my dear lady.
Indeed.
Philip, won't you escort me in?
Of course, my beautiful, little Sausage Fingers.
That's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?
And toast my beautiful bride.
Had we known there was to be a wedding reception, we could've lashed out on taffeta!
quite pleasant once you stop struggling.
So, John, was Larita's family able to attend the wedding?
More cabbage, Madam?
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?
Boats, cars or planes?
- No, horses, silly.
- Ah, yes, horses.
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!
- Stirrup what?
- Cup.
Every November, Philip and Sarah's family host the hunt.
Wait until you meet their father, Lord Hurst, he's terrific.
- And Lady Hurst?
- Was terrific, until she...stopped.
- Stopped what?
- Living.
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.
Between father's polio and Philip's mania for tipping cows...
Can we please just drop the cows?
I think we'll give the fox a break this year.
Oh, no hunt? 
Mrs Winston gave me her saddle. I've had a wax.
Your father and I conspired to make John the Master of the Hunt.
People come from far and wide.
It's such a shame to disappoint them.
Very thoughtful, Mother.
You do hunt, I take it, Larita?
Hypocrites, gossips or defenceless animals?
Bravo!
You wouldn't get her to the start.
We have another conscientious objector, Father.
Company! 
Do you object to the circus or the slaughter, Major?
I support Sheppard's position on pacifism.
Good for you.
So, when does the carnage begin?
After the War Widow's Revue, but before the craft fair, in between the Dog Show and the shoot.
Don't forget the highlight. 
Mother's Christmas dance is the hot ticket.
She's ordered the most exquisite Japanese lanterns.
- From Japan?
- No, Fortnum  Mason's.
Oh, yes.
Prepare for a whirlwind, Larita.
I'm breathless already.
I won't make it to Christmas.
You won't need to.
I won't make it to breakfast!
What were we just eating?
The lumpy grey and beige concoction?
Oh, yes. 
That's the word I was looking for..."greige".
Absolutely no idea.
But it is the speciality of the house.
Incoming! 
Have you met my namesake?
He's very good in bed.
- Shh! 
They'll hear you.
- l don't care.
I do.
I know we need the heat, but please don't smoke.
Mother's clairvoyant about these things.
She loathes me, Johnnie.
I'm a gold-digger, burrowing in from the land of opportunists.
Your father's an interesting study, though.
Quietly sardonic. I like that in a man.
That won't earn you many brownie points under this roof.
After the Armistice, Father didn't come straight home.
He caroused around France and Italy, drinking, having affairs...
A lot of men did similar...
couldn't settle down.
- Why didn't she go after him?
- A question of pride.
He finally just wandered home.
Still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it.
Except in public.
You see, she feels she's missed out on something.
Which means, of course, she's missed out on everything.
Exactly. 
The war robbed her of all her expectations.
She takes one look at a woman like you...
The harlot stealing into the nursery...
The delicious concubine with the delectable ears nose neck.
I could just eat you.
After that meal I'm not surprised.

Dear Lord, thank you for bringing John and his floozy home safely.
'Hmm...
John!
'
- Why is Larita always so late?
- You can't hurry perfection.
- Edgar was never late for a meal.
- He's missed a few lately.
Good morning.
How are we all on this glorious day?
There she is! 
Morning, darling.
What would Madam like for breakfast?
I think Madam will get more sustenance from a kipper.
- But it won't be as much fun.
- Aren't you riding with us?
Darling, I think it's about high time that your mother and I have an intimate tete-a-tete.
- Just us girls.
- Lovely.
What a frightening thought.
Two hemispheres under one roof.
Papua New Guinea, India, the Argentine.
I may not have travelled, but the world has come to me.
Are you coming down with something?
Pollen.
But if I hold my breath long enough...
How peculiar.
Which is why we should get to know one another.
- Where does one start?
- Shall I make headway?
I was born in Detroit.
My father worked in the steel plant.
He was one of the first lured over to Henry Ford.
Ah, hence the love of motoring?
Yes, but I also love animals.
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.
Oh!
You can't be squeamish about livestock now that you are living in the country.
Which was never my intention.
I was happily carving out a niche for myself on the race circuit when I was unexpectedly flagged down by someone irresistible.
Remarrying was the farthest thing from my mind.
I see...
May I ask...?
Oh, dead, unfortunately. 
No children.
Oh...
How disappointing for you.
Still, he provided well, though?
Yes, but there were a lot of hidden costs associated with his passing.
Oh, that beautiful motor car... 
Surely, you must have independent means?
I'm more than happy to discuss my means, but I think you'll be a tad disappointed.
The car is my sole source of income.
Which makes living in London an imperative.
But what will John do in the city?
Work. lt's not uncommon.
Oh!
John was brought up in the country, Larita.
Where will he work?
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St-Martin-ln-The-Fields?
I know this is not perfect so that's why I'm asking for your guidance.
So, please, how can I make this pleasant for everybody?
Well, erm...wartime experience dictates that you keep your head down and you fit in as well as you can.
- Oh, there's a war on?
- Oh, no...not necessarily.
Australian mimosa. 
Mmm...beautiful.
Oh...
And then the British troops opened fire...
How grizzly!
- How'd it go, Mother?
- Oh, marvellous!
Marvellous.
Thanks for the invitation!
Thanks for the invitation!
Oh, it's Lord Hurst!
I fear storm clouds are gathering, Mrs Whit.
Stop being maudlin, Father.
- lt's the future!
- Spanner!
Father, allow me to introduce Panda's new chauffeuse.
- Lovely La-La-Larita.
- Watch it, Philip.
My son is prone to fabrication, but I can see on this occasion he has been perfectly frank, Mrs Whittaker.
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.
No shortage of wits around here any more.
OK, stand back! 
I give you, the future!
All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.
Ha-ha! 
Allergies.
She inflates like a puffer fish.
You just want to squeeze her until she pops.
# ...working at the car wash
# You might not ever strike it rich
# But let me tell you, it's better than digging a ditch
# Working at the car wash!
# Working at the car wash, man
# Come on, now, sing it to me # lt's better than digging a ditch... #
The missus is a bit trigger-happy this week.
Bleeding tinnitus is killing me.
I like the new Mrs Whit. 
Reminds me of the old one before the war.
Only more reasonable. 
You can tell she's run her own household.
Oh, be silent!
Good morning, Furber, Jackson, Millie, and...?
Cook, I can't call you a verb.
Your name?
Beatrice.
All right, all right...it's Doris.
Sorry, Madam.
Always wanted to be called Beatrice.
Well, Beatrice, would you mind if I helped myself in the mornings?
I fear I shall be rising later and later.
Well...if it pleases, Mrs Whit.
The point of the bell?
When I ring it, you come to me, not the other way round!
Larita. 
May I have a word?
Come along!
Would you please refrain from chatting to the staff?
It's chore enough trying to keep this motley crew together.
I had a brilliant French maid in Paris.
Perhaps I should send for her?
Thank you, no...erm... I'd prefer to keep English the first language in this household.
Ah, there you are.
I say! 
Anyone for tennis?
Yes. 
You!
John, Shackleton wouldn't let a dog out today!
The fog has lifted and Whittakers don't do winter.
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.
- No, really. I'm a lot of fun.
- Ooh...
John!
It's brass monkeys out here!
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.
- Hole in one!
- Deuce.
I see your pair of deuces and I raise you a tenner.
The Titanic could have hit that!
Sarah, you're an embarrassment to the family name. I'll have you killed.
Good God! 
What's wrong with you?
No! 
Stop now!
- Stop, everybody! 
Listen!
- Shoot the court jester!
- Nice backhand!
- ls that a backhand compliment?
# Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun!
# The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
# Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve to one
# But Englishmen detest a siesta... #
Laurel and Hardy step up to the crease. 
The fillies are lining up.
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most fetching in her feed bag and bridle!
One woman's heaven...
Oh, she's absolutely beautiful.
Broken, tarnished and completely useless.
Things guaranteed to keep my wife at bay.
May I?
If you don't mind getting your hands dirty.
In Detroit, what we lack in dirt, we make up for in filth.
Your first husband from that neck of the woods?
Oh...well, word gets about.
- So where is he now?
- Dead.
Cancer.
He was a fair bit older than me.
I spent a while playing the unmerry widow but the black wore thin.
- You didn't care for him, I gather?
- l cared too much.
Life was just such an unpleasant experience for the man, I... I'd be a liar to say I wasn't glad when he was relieved of it.
- When were you last in France?
- Just after the war?
On a personal reconnaissance, trying to ascertain what exactly all those fine young men had died for.
Apparently, I'm of the romantic Lost Generation.
What did you lose?
I'm not sure.
Oh, hello...hello.
Who was the tiny tank?
Who's a pretty, little, cheeky chorizo?
On bended knees, please come and play with me.
Johnnie dear, you know how much I love you, so please try to take this in the best possible light.
I'm getting a machine gun and mowing down your entire family.
That's fairly disappointing. I thought you and Father were getting along.
Yes, I might spare the men folk.
But it's awfully dispiriting.
We have absolutely no privacy here.
I never needed any privacy before.
This is my home.
It's not mine.
And I very much want one.
# We're all alone, no chaperone can get our number
# The world's aslumber, let's misbehave
Timing is everything, you little brute!
Umpire at least. 
Philip is pining for you.
If I knew you played tennis, I never would've signed the marriage certificate!
Ow!
Not a bad day for it.
Reading.
My fiance, Edgar, was always hiding behind books.
Erm...you're needed on the tennis court.
John was just asking after you.
Would you like to see a photo of him...my Edgar?
Poppy!
- That's Enrico Caruso.
- Who's dead, I know that...
But if you ignore the nose and the mouth and the ears...
there's a striking resemblance.
I don't actually have a picture of Edgar.
Well...mustn't keep you.
No, no. 
Of course. 
Looking forward to getting stuck in to a good book.
Poppy!
- You haven't seen the beast, have you?
- The dog?
Nope. I haven't.
Poppy!
Oh, poor, poor Poppy. I'm so sorry.
Larita!
I've been sent in to badger you.
Please help us make up doubles?
Oh, Hilda, I can't. I'm only good for the cocktails between sets.
- We're between sets now.
- You can't possibly want me on court.
Philip! 
Go get him.
Poppy!
Poppy!
Poppy!
- What are you doing?
- Reading.
A Biblical Story".
Who gave you this filth?
Go and find the dog! 
Larita!
Please refrain from giving my daughter pornographic literature.
Yes, yes, of course.
Oh, and I've volunteered you and Hilda to perform the Dance of the Dying Swan for the War Widows' Revue.
We're short on numbers.
Lovely. 
Anything to help.
Have you seen the dog?
No. 
Not recently.
Probably out seizing the sunshine like everyone else.
Poppy!
Furber!
Oh, it's you, Madam. I'm sorry.
Can I get you anything?
- A shovel.
- Shovel. 
Of course.
Go and get Philip a hot toddy.
- Philip. 
You look so...so...so...
- The suspense is killing me.
Poppy!
- Oh...sorry.
- lt's fine.
Your brother is such a sharply honed twit.
- Where's our beautiful cougar hiding?
- Under a book, I expect.
I wish she wouldn't slack indoors so much.
Some people would kill to be indoors with Larita.
She isn't built the same as us.
Still, it is annoying, though.
You're such a sport, always ready for anything.
I haven't got Lari's beauty or charm or intelligence.
- She is clever, isn't she?
- Hmm...
Clever...and bored.
I don't understand it. I'm not bored, you're not bored, nobody else is bored.
Your father is, out of his mind.
Father was born bored.
If only she made an effort to play along.
Stop being so torturous, Panda.
You had her playing charades last night.
What more do you want?
John! 
John?
To tell the truth, I never really liked her.
Crabby, snappy, little bitch... I didn't like the dog much, either.
Poor Poppy. 
Casualty of war.
If I may be so bold, Madam?
These people ride horses.
Lots of horses.
It would be advantageous to do the same.
And I thought Detroit was a tough town.
# You do something to me
# Something that simply mystifies me... #
Oh, has your horse run out of gas?
Oh, John, don't hurt it.
Far from it. 
We've got a hunt coming up.
Poor little mite needs a head start.
Go on...run!
So much to learn about each other.
My curriculum vitae. 
The brook is the border of Sarah's property.
Mother always imagined we'd join forces and invade Surrey.
Oh, and how about those foot soldiers on high?
That's Davis, Lord Hurst's man.
And there's Lord Hurst...
Closely followed by my mother-in-law.
I wonder what the devil they're surveying?
Are you disappointed you didn't marry Sarah?
Of course not. 
We've seen each other naked since we were one.
She's part of the...the...the...scenery.
You can hack it a little while longer, can't you?
How long is a little?
And don't say two weeks again.
Well, there's the War Widows' Revue, the craft fair the hunt.
- The memorial service...
- What memorial service?
Friends, we are gathered here today in remembrance of our missing friend, Poppy.
Oh, Poppy...
Wherever you have chosen to sow your seeds, we pray that you are blooming.
We pray that you have gone to a better place.
Shame we don't know exactly where that place is...
Anyway, now for a eulogy from Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.
"Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me.
"The carriage held but just ourselves and immortality."
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop and Poppy got squished.
Scraped off the road and put in a sausage...
Oh, Hilda!
Thank you, Mr Gribble.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, behold Reverend Burton and Marion Whittaker as they reach for the scissors in "Samson and Delilah".
Hark! 
I hear my husband snore!
What the hell happened to Delilah?
Looks like a sock full of oranges.
I'll creep forth on padded foot and relieve him of his ample follicles.
- How hilarious!
- lt's meant to be a tragedy!
Then you succeeded beyond your wildest dreams.
Your father seems to have a fan.
Don't read too much into it. 
She was a godsend during mother's last months.
Sometimes I wonder where they'd be without each other.
My ample follicles are in dire need of a trim.
I wouldn't taunt the artistes, my little dying swans. 
You're on next.
I've encouraged my girls to undertake something a little more contemporary.
Hilda and I seem to have a talent for the can-can.
The traditional can-can, performed without underwear?
- Oh, Philip!
- Anything for you, Philip.
Yes, anything.
That'll raise a bit more than money for the war widows.
- l'm doubling my donation.
- Oh, Pinkie.
Fans at the ready, gentlemen!
All the way from gay Paris, I give you Miss Hilda Whittaker and, for her debut performance, Mrs John Whittaker doing 'The Can-Can'!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Did...did you...?
is it my imagination, or is your daughter dancing without her scanties?
Ow!
Bravo!
It's not Lari's fault.
She said it was traditional!
Philip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.
Everyone understood that except Nelly No Knickers here!
Hilda isn't as experienced as your wife, John. 
No one is.
If you're not prepared to have a straight talk to her, then I certainly am.
Don't be ridiculous. 
You'll lose a finger.
- Lord Hurst will never speak to me.
- Rubbish. I saw you in the back fields.
Preparing the jumps for the hunt!
I'm completely humiliated!
I'll never get a husband now!
After tonight, I'd have thought they'll be lining up round the block.
I hate her! 
Hate, hate, hate her!
The advance notices are sensational, Mrs John.
is it my imagination or is the cutlery particularly deafening this evening?
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.
- That's easy for you to say.
- lt's surprisingly hard to be easy.
- You're smiling, Jim.
- God forbid, the wind might change.
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you were going to take me seriously...
You could have made an effort to enjoy it less.
I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.
It's not fair! 
You've got two husbands, and I've had none.
- Technically, I have one.
- But you've had two.
I've had two shoes and it's a great deal more practical.
I dare say you've worn down more soles than that.
John...
Marion, Larita's first husband died of cancer. 
Stop being so callous.
Oh, I'm sure Marion can appreciate the pain of watching a loved one slip through her fingers.
She's scandalous!
You should hear what they're saying about her in the village.
Well, let's stop the wagging tongues, shall we?
is it true you've had as many lovers as they say?
Of course it's not true, Mrs Whittaker.
Hardly any of them actually loved me.
That was uncalled for.
I realise it was a joke, but still...
- You threw me to the wolves in there.
- Marion hardly constitutes wolves.
All right, you threw me to the voles.
Either way, you abandoned me.
Your sisters need to be restrained.
Restrained? 
Hilda breaks loose once and she's almost institutionalised.
And poor old Marion...
Edgar drops by for a cup of sugar, and mother has his name engraved on the family crypt.
- l'm sorry but it really is very funny.
- Hilarious!
Welcome to the petrified circus.
Meet the resident contortionist who can't bend any further.
Then stop. 
Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.
# You do that voodoo that you do so well... #
You're right, of course. I'm a hypocrite, pretending to be someone I'm not.
Especially since it isn't working.
What the devil has that dog dug up?
Pilot, what have you got there?
How could you not tell us?
Marion, it was an accident.
I am walking on eggshells here.
And I believe I panicked.
And once again, I'm very, very sorry.
How could you do it? 
How could you?
I imagine she lowered her full weight onto the Chihuahua beneath her.
Marion, please.
John, did you have anything to do with this?
No. 
No, I was the sole perpetrator of Poppy's demise.
And ever since I have been wracked with guilt.
Please, please, please let me buy you a new dog.
You might buy your loved ones in the United States, but you can't in the United Kingdom.
How unfortunate.
You could at least show some remorse.
I am full of remorse. I just refuse to invest in amateur theatrics to convince you of my sincerity.
That's not how I came off the assembly line. I'm sorry.
I can't change.
Not for you...
not for anybody...any more.
And I wouldn't want her any other way. 
So...
- Madam, the dog.
- Oh, stay back! 
Stay back!
I knew it the second I laid eyes on her. 
She's a killer.
She sat on poor Poppy deliberately.
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.
My brother has married a dog murderer.
She should be put down.
Put through a divorce court.
The Lord does not sanction divorce.
The Lord is Almighty, Marion.
He can sanction anything he likes.
The sooner they move out the better.
They move out?
John isn't going anywhere.
Watch and learn.
It's so unfair.
Why can't I have a room like this?
I could die of envy!
Laying to rest this tragic incident, we've had this splendid set of rooms made over for you, haven't we, Jim?
Yes. 
My wife would like you to rest in peace.
I even had an old friend of Johnnie's brought down from the attic.
"Old Faithful Awaits His Master's Return".
I used to sleep under that silly painting.
Very comforting, I'm sure, but we're expected back in Mayfair.
But these are the largest rooms in the house.
You'll find nothing like it in London.
- She has a point.
- She always does.
Sometimes I don't know why you ever did wander home.
And miss all the fun?
Cook would like to inform you, Mrs Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.
Oh!
What bird, hmm?
Thursday is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.
Oh, but I have!
In appreciation of your understanding and for that delicious double bed.
We'll think of you every time we use it.
- What exactly are we celebrating?
- Thanksgiving.
Thanks for what, hmm?
The annihilation of an entire indigenous people.
A loving union of two great cultures.
- Just like us.
- How transcontinental.
- l can't believe you got into the kitchen.
- Beatrice did put up a fight.
- But technically I outrank her.
- Who's Beatrice?
Your cook. 
Or now my undercook, since I'm qualified cordon bleu.
That's a degree.
Furber...take the vegetables down to the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.
No, Furber, thank you.
I think I'll surprise my alimentary canal.
Mother, if you don't mind, I'm going to eat my meal before it gets cold.
Furber, I've changed my mind, bring it back!
Me, too.
Gobble, gobble!
Yes!
Here's a tip, Hilda.
A sure way to a man's heart is through his stomach. 
Or his mother.
Larita, look, I've found another likeness of Edgar.
- Marion, this is Fatty Arbuckle.
- Who's in jail, I know that.
But if you cut out his cheeks and give him a bald patch, there's a striking resemblance...
Edgar's away on a trip across the pond, sewing his wild oats, or something agricultural.
- She's good, I'll give her that.
- l think you're over-reacting.
Lari? 
Lari!
Not the vase! 
Not the vase!
"Taking the corncockle buds and bee-kissed roses
"roughly in his calloused hands,
"his hot, moist tulip exploded in her river of delights..."
Larita?
Early Christmas present...
- For you, darling.
- Ooh, the mind boggles.
Well, it's...it's... lt's magnificent.
It's monstrous!
It's me. I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?
Very expressive, darling, but I can't quite see you in it.
You can see everything else!
You took your clothes off in front of a total stranger?
- Of course she took her clothes off.
- l think it's unholy.
I'm not sure I approve of you being nude.
You know, without...without me.
Extraordinary.
What exactly are you hoping to achieve?
Just trying to get into the swing of things...
Mother.
Marvellous! 
Well, then, you'll be riding in the hunt with us, won't you?
I might be persuaded if the painting stays.
- Hunt.
- Paint.
- Hunt.
- Paint.
Hunt!
Very well.
Hunt.
View, hello.
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you. 
Richard.
Morning, Jim!
After generations of false starts, we've finally managed to combine our cavalry.
Congratulations.
A marriage of minor convenience.
You'll be fine, I promise.
The second you have the Holborough boy's eye, flirt outrageously.
But Warwick Holborough has ears like the Cambridge Cup!
And Philip's the prize. 
Now, if you want a man's attention...ignore him.
Warwick the Wingnut and Sausage Fingers?
What a handsome couple.
They'll have puppies not children.
Wait...there's something I need to say.
I see you...you're wasted here.
When the time comes...give me a ring.
If I could find your neck, I'd wring it.
- Larita's making sheep's eyes at Philip.
- She's a Venus de Flytrap!
- She wants him all to herself.
- She's not interested in Philip.
- Nobody's interested in Philip.
- l am!
Mount up, Larita.
If you don't mind, I think I might give the fox a head start.
Lari, get on the pony, please.
Oh, it's just as I thought...
Oh, I said I'd ride, and I'm always good for my word.
Tally-ho!
# Spy on me, baby, use satellite # lnfrared to see me move through the night
# Aim, going to fire, shoot me right # l'm going to like the way you fight
# Now you've found the secret code I use
# To wash away my lonely blues
# So I can't deny or lie cos you're the only one to make me fly
# Sex bomb, sex bomb, you're a sex bomb
# You can give it to me when I need to come along...
What?
# You're my sex bomb... #
- What is she doing?
- A victory lap, by the look of things.
There's something wild about that child that's so contagious.
Whoo-hoo!
Well, she promised she'd ride.
Ha-ha!
# ...no chaperone can get our number
# The world's in a slumber, let's misbehave!
# There's something wild about you, child, that's so contagious
# Let's be outrageous, let's misbehave!
# When Adam won Eve's hand, he wouldn't stand for teasin'
# He didn't care about those apples out of season
# They say that Spring means just one little thing to little lovebirds
# We're not above birds, let's misbehave... #
Whoo!
Miss Hilda, telephone from New York.
Uncle George?
Oh, thank God, a friendly voice.
Yes, and she's a complete nightmare.
Really?
How salacious.
Come in.
Mother?
I'd like to apologise for today's schmozzle.
That really won't be necessary.
Larita made no secret of her disapproval of blood sports.
She did ride as promised.
Well, we should credit her with her imaginative way of keeping her word.
You must be very proud of her.
Mother, I think... I think maybe Larita and I ought to go.
Oh...
Yes, I see. 
Very well.
Feel free to drop in whenever it takes your fancy.
- Off you go. 
Enjoy.
- Don't be like that.
I'm sorry, dear, wasn't Mummy being kind enough?
Take these, they might get you as far as Constantinople!
- And this...
Casablanca.
- Mother, stop it!
No. 
You stop it!
The money's gone, John.
Nothing left.
The only thing standing between this family and bankruptcy are those surveyors in the back field.
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400 acres to keep the bailiffs away.
It's your legacy, John Whittaker...
and I'm selling it.
- l had no idea.
- No... 
No, you don't.
You were supposed to take over the estate, take your responsibilities.
But you were unexpectedly flagged down.
I've been struggling for years with a man who doesn't care, waiting for you to step up to the mark.
No. 
You just go.
Go to Algiers with your racing car driver.
I'm too tired to care any more!
It's not exactly surprising, John. 
Look at the grounds.
- Your mother is being very practical.
- ln what sense?
You're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.
Philip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.
Subdividing the land and selling to a neighbour is an elegant solution.
Somewhat harsh.
I've had my fair share of selling off my past, and it is an auction of innocence that's neither fun nor pretty, but it is realistic, something your mother excels in.
But it's my responsibility.
Gracious, how can I have been so blind?
Oh, winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?
It's a controlled mixture of passion, persistence and horse manure.
I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the new bride.
Ah! 
John's wife has very fickle allergies.
- Allergies to what?
- Flowers, Emma. 
Can you believe it?
That is a strange choice of bed fellow for this neck of the woods.
You'll just have to make do with John and Sarah.
It'll be like old times.
# When you're smiling, the whole world smiles... #
Why the big Panda eyes?
I've often meant to ask you something, but I hadn't the courage.
Well, don't then.
Did you think I behaved like a cad, marrying Larita without telling you?
No, of course not.
You took the opportunity and married for love. I respect you for it.
If we'd have married it would've been for friendship and convenience.
- Would it?
- Yes!
We knew one another far too well.
I want my marriage to be thrilling, romantic, with passionate love letters.
- l could've written you love letters.
- Well, you didn't, did you?
I did love you all the same.
John, stop it.
He's very different from the man I met in France.
The boy. 
The same, sweet boy.
is it true what she says?
Are you really selling off the land?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the faintest idea.
But it's your home, it's your community.
Doesn't that matter?
No.
You're a dark horse.
Have you noticed how few men of my age there are in this village?
Fourteen years ago, we all took the King's shilling.
We all signed up together.
My brother, friends, staff...
All hunkered down in the front row of The Great War.
I thought they kept majors safely behind desks?
Promotion for surviving.
As captain, it was my job to get them all out of the trenches.
Within the first four minutes of our first charge 20,000 men died.
In Thorverton, down the road here they were stationed in Morocco.
Their captain bought them all home.
I didn't bring a single man back.
This whole village died.
I think there's a glimmer of life in you yet.
Well, if there is, it has no time for pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.
- Why did you come back?
- l had no choice.
Bonjour, Madame.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?
'She came for you?
'
Why the lie?
She thought "wandering home" sounded better.
And to be perfectly frank, I no longer cared.
I hate new games. 
There are too many balls, I can't sink anything.
- Sink some gin, Sausage Fingers!
- l never, ever win.
Oh, well done!
Stop sucking it. 
Come and help.
Come on, Pops.
All right, Missie, hold your horses.
Right, clear the decks, puppies.
May I?
I was hoping to have a word.
We're accentuating the positive today, I don't have a mind for anything else.
Of course...of course.
I know you are under considerable stress...
Regarding what?
Lord Hurst's kind offer to buy into your property.
The realtor I'm dealing with in London also specialises in subdivision.
Perhaps he could help negotiate a premium price.
Thank you, but really this is of no concern of yours.
Of course it's a concern. I am a member of this family now and I'd like to help.
And this is your interpretation of "help", is it?
Carving up our heritage and selling it off to the highest bidder?
Coming from a country no older than the chair you are sitting in, it seems a very practical solution.
Just forget the seven generations of people who have devoted their entire lives to farming this land.
Get someone else to do it.
With a machine, no less.
Who do you think you are?
Swinging your wherewithal like a cat on heat.
If you really want to be of assistance, Larita, I think you know what's required.
Right... I think it's time an expert showed you how this game is played.
Watch it...
Bravo!
What a sportswoman, I must say.
Can you imagine? 
Fantastic!
'Lari, you're confusing me.'
- 'l'm feeling trapped.' - 'l don't understand.' lt's this house!
It has an air of doom hanging over it.
And I can barely stand the weight much longer.
The answer is to go abroad again.
Not yet. 
This is my life for now, you know that.
- And what part do I play in it?
- Do you have to be so loud?
Of course I do! 
I'm American.
What is the use of bickering like this?
It doesn't lead anywhere.
You never know.
It might lead to a natural end.
Do you want it to?
Do you?
No!
I just want some peace and quiet.
You're far too young to make a remark like that.
I can't help my age Grandma.
Look, I'm sorry that I leave you alone so much. 
Honestly, I'm sorry.
Good. 
Then let's do something about it.
Why are we driving so fast?
The thrill of escape!
You're looking very game today.
Fairest game in the land.
A penny for your thoughts?
It's more than pennies, I'm afraid, Pinkie.
I don't think I can afford the party this year.
- But the Japanese lanterns!
- No, cancelled.
Had to choose, Japanese lanterns or the maid.
You're not getting out of it that easily.
My offer of cellar and staff still stands.
It wouldn't be Christmas without your knees-up.
Oh! 
This is the first piece of clarity I've had since arriving. 
Whoo!
Why can't we live in moments like these forever?
Why?
Because you've stopped loving me, my darling!
How can you say that?
Oh, I just open my mouth and the words come out.
Then let's make a fresh start.
There are so many things I need to tell you about me. 
Hard things.
I don't care.
I do.
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.
# l'll see you again whenever Spring breaks through again...
Come on.
# Time may lie heavy between
# But what has been is past forgetting
# This sweet memory
# Throughout my life will come to me
# Though the world may go awry... #
Shot!
John!
- Top hole.
- Oh!
I can't decide which is worse, that you had to sneak outside to get some privacy, or that you were caught by Veronica.
Who's Veronica?
I am. lt's my name.
- l fail to see the humour in it!
- No, darling, you're quite right.
I can certainly see the serious implications. lt's not a laughing matter.
It's only a laughing matter.
Indecent exposure is illegal.
Even in America.
Yep, yep...
You're right.
And we're very, very sorry, aren't we?
- No, I'm not. 
This is my husband.
- And this is my home!
Maybe it's time for them to fly the nest?
Certainly not. 
They will stay put and brazen this out.
And you can get that ghastly painting out of my house!
We do not need any more reminders of your easy virtue!
- Excited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, sir.
- Miss Hilda...
- Uncle George... 
How explosive!
Furber, I recognise that as asparagus.
Correct, Madam.
- Ha! 
I pity poor Panda.
- Oh, what is it now?
Read! "The Detroit News".
Uncle George is a super sleuth!
Collecting old newspapers is the last refuge of a truly boring man.
Boring? 
Far from it. lt was a scandal!
Wasn't it...
Mrs Morley?
Mrs Tom Morley of Detroit, Michigan.
Don't be grotesque, Hilda.
Well, I suppose I'd better finish my meal before it wilts entirely.
- Any dressing?
- Oh, I am genuinely shocked!
- No thanks, I always end up wearing it.
- We've been hoodwinked!
- Especially that runny vinaigrette.
- Fire and brimstone!
Mayonnaise has more ballast.
Will you stop this insulting behaviour immediately?
Oh, I always hated that photo of myself.
Of everything I ever expected, nothing prepared me for this.
- For what?
- She was charged with murder.
- l was acquitted.
- And that's consolation?
- l told you my husband died.
- But you didn't tell us how, did you?
Does John know about this?
- l see...
- lt's no concern of ours.
Father! 
Really!
Yes, and after Hilda went to all that trouble digging it up.
I'm going outside for a cigarette.
Care to join me?
Thank you, Jim. 
Don't mind if I do.
No concern?
The pack's closing.
This woman has taken advantage of our son!
He'd never have married her if he'd known.
- You know that, do you?
- You'd have preferred we had an affair?
- lt would've been more appropriate!
- Mother!
- Unfortunately, I agree with you!
- lt's easy to talk like this now.
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking.
I love John, but it's not blind love.
Marion, does that sound indicate contempt or asthma?
You can't palm us off like that, Mrs Morley.
This is your doing.
You're a bigger fool than you look.
Larita is your type, isn't she, Father?
That is the nicest thing any of you have ever said.
Hello, are we having a picnic?
John...
I think your wife better unveil this one herself. 
Don't you, Larita?
Before we met I was involved in a court case over the death of my husband.
It was seedy and stressful, but since I was found innocent l didn't think it necessary to burden you with the details.
Innocent?
She was responsible for a man killing himself!
The verdict was suicide but that's not where it started.
I thought it was cancer.
It was...
But he was so desperately sick.
If you'd known him, you would've understood how forgivable it was.
- lt's not as if she poisoned him.
- That's what everyone thinks.
- She's a black widow.
- l pity you, Marion.
Really? 
Well, I won't let you!
Right, that's it! 
You have a dance to organise, I suggest you all get to it!
Now!
Hilda! 
Come on, inside!
John...
Are you crying because you're angry or ashamed?
Neither.
Coming here has been the most demoralising experience of my life.
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to, everything just happened so fast.
That's not good enough.
I tried to, several times.
But you trusted me..."absolutely".
And you saw the field day those fatuous hypocrites made of it.
Please remember they're my family.
I shouldn't think of them at all if they weren't.
Still...you should have told me.
You should have loved me more.
I couldn't love you any more.
You should have loved me better.
I don't understand you, Larita.
I don't understand you at all.
1 ...2...3... 
Are you all left feet?
Dancing with you is like trying to move a piano.
I wonder what the American will be wearing.
Or who she'll be poisoning!
Do you like long, moonlit walks?
Only when taken by people who annoy me.
You've got me all to yourself.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.
And which little fool, pray tell, gave her that?
- You ought to see if Larita is coping.
- l already have. 
She's fine.
It's been a very trying day for her, John.
- Go and escort your wife down.
- No, I wouldn't worry.
You know my wife, she'll make an entrance when she's ready.
Come in.
Quickly, you'll blow my cover.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Watching.
People are so universally similar when their guard is down.
Oh, hello! 
Ha-ha!
It seems they are universally similar when their guard is up, as well.
May I?
- Thank you for being gallant today.
- You are damn cool in a crisis.
The judge at my trial said something similar.
Why did you do it?
Why did you marry John?
My first husband was older, and his end was messy.
Long afterwards, this boy this pure boy arrived fresh and unblemished.
I married him because any other relationship seemed cheap and squalid.
My first marriage cost me my youth, and here I am stealing someone else's.
What will you do?
The best I can.
Oh, Davis, thank you.
- And thank you, Pinkie.
- No, not at all, my dear.
- Just look at this turnout.
- Hmm...
They've only come for a repeat performance of the Cincinnati succubus.
May I have the pleasure?
Oh, look!
- Tango, please.
- Certainly. 
Tango...
Dance with me, John.
Lari, don't.
Please? 
Dance with me.
That was very gallant.
- You've got to stop them, Mother.
- No, I don't.
Oh, marvellous! 
Marvellous!
Straight from the bordellos of Buenos Aires to the Hippodrome of London, Maestro, take it away!
Jim, this is the end.
Congratulations, Madam.
- Have you been drinking, Furber?
- Yes, Madam. 
Prodigiously.
- You are full of surprises.
- Oh, yes, Madam.
I was even arrested once.
- What for?
- Bigamy.
Ah, there you are, Pinkie, I've found you.
Larita, where are you going?
Away, Sarah. 
For John's sake.
Far, far away.
is there anything I can do?
You can look after him.
Women like me are tiresome in love.
We expect too much.
Marry John. lt's the way things always should've been.
- l'm just so sorry I got in the way.
- You love him that much?
Go. I'll cover for you.
Sweet Sarah.
So glad you've recovered from your headache.
Please don't build any convenient social lies on my behalf.
- l say, Mother is only...
- Fighting to keep the charade alive?
You've shown tremendous fortitude holding this family together, Veronica, and I can respect that.
What I can't respect is the manipulative road you've chosen to maintain control.
This war is over. 
Move on.
"Move on." Oh, how convenient.
Oh, wake up, Marion.
Edgar's not coming back.
And that ring isn't stuck, you are.
And Hilda, you've got such promise, yet you're squandering it on malice.
My advice to both you girls?
Run! 
Go see the world through your own eyes.
So speaks the siren, leading the sailors to their death.
At least I'm not Medusa, turning them to stone.
- Get out!
- Larita? 
Lari?
- Lari, don't go.
- John, I have to.
I can't live here. 
Nothing can.
But you're my wife, and I love you.
Oh, John, my darling...
You don't know what love is.
You have no idea what it means to love someone so much that you will do anything for them.
Even inject them with poison when they were too feeble to do it for themselves.
I don't believe that you could've ever loved me like that.
Oh, John, let her go.
Let her go, off into the sunset to inject another family with her poison!
Mother...
Off you go!
Before your past catches up with you...again!
Mother!
Oh, you evil...
Mother! 
Shut up!
They are predicting warmer weather, Madam.
Yes, Furber, I believe they are.
Thank you.
Very generous.
There's something special in there for Jackson. 
Make sure he gets it.
Of course.
Where will Madam be staying?
Who knows?
Good luck.
And you, Furber.
Would you forward the painting please, Furber?
To where, sir?
I shall enjoy passing on the good news, sir.

Salvage any of Jackson's appalling pruning and send it to Mrs. Holborough, who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton for tonight's dinner.

It might be an awkward meal.

You can clear up this mess and get Cook to send up a ham.

Thank you. 
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.

Aren't you the woman who won the Grand Prix?

Oh!

Hello.
Mother's turned our old nursery into a boudoir.
I wouldn't exactly call it a boudoir, Hilda.
Marvelous. 
All those grubby memories of Little Johnny.

We didn't even have time to raid the hothouse.
I only hope we can make you comfortable.
Please, don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

Not "Mrs. Whittaker. " It's "Mother" now.
Oh, I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, darling.
Well, since time is so clearly against us, why don't you show Larita up to the nursery?
Dinner's at 8:00.
(DOG BARKING)
You didn't tell them?
One bombshell at a time, darling.
That's not fair!
Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?
A few days?
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family for generations and what do I get in return?
A few days. 
And look at her.
What am I supposed to do with the bauble of a woman?
Hang her?
I think she's splendid.
Oh, do you, Hilda?
Well, we can all relax.
She's not what I expected.

I like her.

How long is a few days?
Mother, Larita and I would like to find a home in London.
But this is your home.
A home of their own.
But...
But, Panda, we need you here.
Since you went off on your quick jaunt around the Riviera, we've had to let go of six more people.
Mother, if you'd just listened to me and taken on some machinery...
Wouldn't that be a good idea? 
I could run the entire estate single-handedly.
Congratulations on your insight and your spontaneity.
Sarah and Phillip are coming to dinner tonight, and I have got a table plan that will take the League of Nations to unravel.
Tonight?
That's absolutely splendid!
Don't be so fickle in your affections, John.
Sarah might not be as accommodating as you expect.
Codswallop.
She'll be delighted.
If Mother was so desperate for her hand in marriage, she should have asked for it herself.
Strange as it may seem, I agree with your sister.
I think you're wrong.
On certain things, yes.
Call her.
Really?
Really.
Really!
If Edgar were here, he'd do the manly thing.
What? 
Run away?
(GASPS) Here they come!
And the checkered flag goes to...
Fast work, John.
JOHN: 
I should have written you, Sarah, but it all happened so fast, I didn't know where I was.
In Larita's arms, it seems.
Please don't be disappointed.
Of course I'm disappointed, but tell me you're happy, and I'll tell you you're forgiven.
You're the top. 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top.

I'm afraid not.
He sends his love.

Yes, John.
Had we known there was to be a wedding reception, we could have all lashed out on taffeta.
She's a lot like drowning, quite pleasant once you stop struggling.
MRS. WHITTAKER: 
So, tell me, John. 
Was Larita's family able to attend the wedding?
(BANGING)
(PHILLIP GROANING) SARAH: 
Phillip!
(ALL LAUGHING)
More cabbage, madam?
No, thank you.
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?
Boats, cars or planes?
No, horses, silly.
LARITA: 
Ah, yes, horses.
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.
(LAUGHING)
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!
Stirrup what?
Cup.
Every November, Phillip and Sarah's family host the hunt.
Wait till you meet their father, Lord Hurst. 
He's terrific.
And Lady Hurst?
PHILLIP: 
Was terrific until she stopped.
- Agirlfriend of mine.
- And here's Herminia.
Herminia doesn't like my filming about Leonor's past.
She has the feeling she wouldn't have liked it.
Leave it there.
- You like this too?
- Yes, of course I do.
I hope she understands that her sister's story is mine as well.
Most of her family still lives in the country.
My cousin Alba helps her father with the cows. 
My life has nothing to do with hers, with animals, climate, rain or shine.
Okay, be still, be still
It was too difficult to live in Vall Fosca and Leonor left.
Leonor's trip turn my mom and me into urban women.
No, come here.
At times I think she chose not to know anything about her father, fearing what she could discover.
And her fear brought me here
On June 9th, prisoner Arroniz testifies that he got to Gavà in 1929, at age 23, and worked at the Roca factory as a radiator assembler.
[Next stop, Gavà.]
- Here we are.
- Hello.
- Who is Carla?
- Me.
- You're Carla?
- How are you?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I called you but...
- We spoke over the phone.
I thought you were your mother, but you're the granddaughter.
Yes.
- How old were you when?
- The war? 
7.
7.And 10 when it ended.
I remember because, as I said we used to come here to get
- powdered milk.
- Here?
My mother was here. 
The CNT, FAI, had there union here.
I came in back there, a 7, 8-year old kid.
And I saw how they made paellas with rabbit and tomatoes.
This was full of wool mattresses.
- They were requisitioned.
- Yes, for the war.
They'd make the paellas right here.
- Right under there.
- Yes, there.
They had a wire fence, and that was full of chickens, chicks, rabbits, everything they requisitioned for the war, and we made the paella right here.
Did you feel he had some sort of post here?
Everyone was on equal terms.
They were all militiamen.
No captains nor lieutenants.
Theywere all militiamen.
- How do you remember Arroniz?
- He was husky.
He was very husky.
It's as if I were seeing him now.
He was a husky man.
He and Long John were husky.
The other 2 were short.
Then he went to France, came back, got involved with a gang, robbed a bank,
he got caught and was executed.
- He robbed a bank?
- So they say.
- That was in Barcelona.
- He didn't come back to Gavà?
So he went to France, came back...
Then he went to my wife's town, Alquer'as.
- Really, to Alquer'as?
- Yes, and my wife was a child.
She'd see him hide beneath the lemon and orange trees.
And since there were fascists there as well, they'd have killed him. 
So he hid out and slept at his mother's.
She lived there, and he hid during the day.
- My wife used to see him.
- Sure, looking out.
George Orwell wrote:
"It is better to have fought and lost than not to have fought at all."
The Gavà militia.
I'll never know if any of these was Arroniz, I never saw him.
But knowing he could be in this group of men means being closer.
But, closer to what? 
I don't know. **
I need to speak to someone who understands Arroniz.
And so I contacted Abel Paz.
He knows about living in jail and underground.
You've found no other family or political relationships?
With other companions?
No, I've onlyfound a woman, but she knows nothing.
No one wants to talk.
I know very little of his companions.
What have I got to do with this?
I don't understand a thing.
- You don't understand?
- No.
Well, it's impossible to know if all this is true or not.
To work from a hypothesis, to try and understand the possibilities.
Guesses only.
- Don't you have the file there?
- Yes.
- Let me see it.
- Sure.
The investigation to compile this report has concluded that
Juan Arroniz Moreno's record is unfavourable, both morally as well as politically and socially.
Having gone through the police files, he has no previous record.
...to understand what went through his head.
- Like anyworker at that time.
- And what was that?
I don't know.
They were up to their balls from being exploited.
That's the problem.
The working class then was not like the working class now.
Today there are too many cars, back and forth...
But the working class wasn't up to that, it was up to other things.
That type died, they killed it.
Today's type is shit.
- That type of people, you mean?
- Yes, the people.
Why did they struggle, for what ideal?
What made them keep on struggling?
My God!
If you ask me that...
It's very basic but I'd like you to tell me.
- And why me?
- Because you understand it better.
I don't know, I think.
It's logical, isn't it?
I don't understand anything.
I don't understand a thing.
I know nothing at all.
You understand?
And all I know is as if I knew nothing.
You look nice.
You like it, don't you?
I am glad you like it.
Turn around.
- Are you getting pretty, Leo?
- Yes.
As my granddad materialized in my imagination, grandma moved further away from us.
I tried to imagine what happened between Arroniz and her.
But what most worried me was that she was fading away.
- Does she like to be combed?
- Yes, a lot.
This is a monument to those executed during the war.
- Yes, in Barcelona.
- Like my own father.
- Yes, way at the top.
- The monument they built up there.
She had no trust in that man.
Since he left her by dying, she never forgave him.
Grandma never forgave him.
I don't know.
- What is this?
- "Fossar de la Pedrera."The columns.
- I think we came with grandma.
- You may be right.
They go by years.
- Look.
- I didn't know that.
1940, 1942, 44.
- Are the names there?
- Yes. 
Your father was executed
- in 1940.
- '40.
Sure, the year of my birth.
And, of course, my mother was left alone, with a daughter, and that was very tough, because as I got older
the stress was terrible.
- What was his name? 
I don't remember.
- Arroniz.
- Arroniz.
- Juan? 
Juan Arroniz.
Look, here's the "E".
- And here's the "B".
- The"B", here?
Yes, the"B" is over here.
The "B" moves upwards to the"A".
- Let's see.
- Juan Arroniz. 
There.
Arroniz.
That's him. 
Wow!
That same day, she decided her father was a hero.
Aforgotten stone column in a cemeterywas enough for her.
You never bring me here...
- Wherever, you burn me out.
- I do?
Yes. 
But not here. 
Perhaps we'll see someone we don't want to.
- Because death... you deal with someone...
I guess.
To follow Arroniz's tracks.
What is there of him in us?
Was there ever anything?
Arroniz is a ghost that has marked grandma and mother forever.
...as a child, an adolescent, as I was always used to being with my mom and grandma.
Just the 3 of us.
When I went to a home with around 20 members, I'd think:
"What is this?"
- Mothers and fathers.
- Mothers and fathers.
- Yes, it was shocking.
- It shocked you too?
It still does. 
I remember Lea's home in Brazil a few years ago.
The parents were holding hands, watching a TVsoap opera.
I think I pulled a disgusted or surprised face.
"What are they doing?"
When children said "my parents", ljust had my mother.
When I felt uneasy, I'd say "my parents". 
That I remember.
One year I lived a few months with my father and it was very strange for me to say I'm living with my father.
Ateacher even gave me a comb thinking: "Poor girl, no one even combs her."
Mom, stop.
You're going through a test for your headaches.
Okay.
- It's a sort of photographs.
- Does it hurt?
No. 
But I think it takes about 20 minutes
- and you must be very still.
- All alone?
- You'll see me.
- That will keep me calm.
I'll be by your side, but you must be still.
If not, the pictures wouldn't be clear. 
Okay?
Please sit here.
- Shall I take my shoes off?
- There's no need.
- Now please lay down.
- And put my feet there?
- And your head to the back.
- Asleeping position, mom.
- You can close your eyes.
- Move a bit further down.
- Raise your legs a bit.
- You can close your eyes.
- Yes, that's no problem.
- My eyes?
But stay completely still.
You'll wear this sort of helmet.
Here's a mirror.
Open your eyes and you can see us.
- I see my daughter.
- Great, that's perfect.
- How's that?
- Fine.
The atrophy of these surfaces, precisely, is characteristic of the Alzheimer's disease.
What we see specifically with this study is images that could mean a slight dementia, cerebral atrophy, that do not specify a specific disease but, as we also see here, the atrophy of the hippocampus lobe,
these are specific. 
So with the existence of both atrophies, the probability of a patient with these plates having Alzheimer's, and not some other dementia, is high.
- Don't worry, they don't bite.
- Okay.
- I hope not.
- They're tied up.
- Look at the cats.
- They all come here.
- Stop that!
- Look at the cats.
The cats kill the rats.
- It's very hot.
- Hi, pretty boy.
This dog is so pretty.
Hello, pretty ones.
- Come here.
- They'll come along alright.
- Your prince is far away...
- She said she be right here.
- Do you want to ask Herminia...
- Don't slip there.
- Anything else about your father?
- She must know what the father was.
- I don't know much.
- No?
I was very young.
- What was he like?
- Very tall.
Husky and tall.
- That's all I know.
- He was killed?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- You know he was killed.
- Well, yes,
- but he left, so I don't know.
- Leonor said nothing?
No.
- Did he love her?
- I think so. 
I don't know.
They're similar!
You can tell they're sisters.
This is the mother of them all.
She has a wound.
- She probably had a fight.
- Why'd he come here?
He wanted to get married, I think, but his papers...
- With Leonor?
- Yes.
...never get here, so he went to Barcelona to get them, and never came back.
My mother, Ana, was born 3 months after that trip.
- Do you think grandma loved him?
- At the beginning.
Those were men who went out, traveled to see things, people...
They weren't a couple who'd go have lunch somewhere. 
No.
He did as he pleased, and she must have been annoyed or...
Then there was that other man, remember?
What do you mean "theyweren't a couple"?
Well, he'd go out on his own and come see her a while the next day.
- And that's a bit...
- Grandma told you that?
Yes.
- You think he had various women?
- Yes! 
And she knew that.
- How old are you now?
- Oh, I don't know.
- I don't remember.
- More or less.
- Now, maybe60 or 60-odd.
- Okay.
- Lf not 70. 
No, not 70.
- What's your birth date?
Around...
During the war, the 13th I guess.
When is your birthday?
You three are very strong women.
Leonor...
- Leonor was very brave.
- She was very brave.
Brave because you, a cultured, working woman...
- Just normal.
- Well, more than normal.
- And not vain.
- And not vain.
You're strong, you have a husband and you tell him,
- you tell your husband...
- Husband? 
Not even in dreams!
But listen.
You educate your daughter, you work, you're an independent woman.
- Your parents' names?
- Father died before I was born.
But what were their names?
My mother was alive but, my father, that's my father, was killed.
- What was his name?
- I don't remember.
Do you remember your mother's name?
No, I don't.
Fist, fist, side and palms down.
Now you.
May God help me.
Let's see.
The last movement.
Palms up?
- Palms down.
- Like this?
Listen carefully.
Pearl, garden, crown, hero, sand, cat,
carnation, lake, gorilla, prison.
What do these words remind you of?
My father's prison.
He wanted people to have their own lives, but got caught and was killed.
Do they remind you of anything else?
I don't remember.
Her diagnosis is presenile dementia, family-related, Alzheimer tipus.
Although she does it at a very later age.
Wear these glasses. 
They're better than your sunglasses.
- These are sunglasses.
- No, they're reading glasses.
- Really?
- Yes. 
Look.
Now you'll do a few exercises.
They are drawings.
Help!
Let's see if I can draw them and you copy them right here.
- Okay?
- No.
They are very simple.
She has lost the capacity to record this memory, store it, because she can't store it, and that's what we call learning and working memory because, if I don't remember what I've been told, I can't do anything.
Which now?
This one? 
Just as it is?
When will she be on the street and not know how to come home?
I think that will be pretty soon because when that space, the clock, is unstructured... the clock tells us where east and west are,
it's to divide this office in 4 and know I have something in front of me and another behind...
The "clock" has many interpretations.
I think she'll go out and not know where she's going.
I'll draw the sphere of a clock.
And you draw the time: 10:10.
- Where should I start?
- How'd you draw a clock?
I can't draw a clock.
Just one of those.
I don't know how a clock goes.
- Could I do this?
- I don't know.
- Aclock is round.
- Don't copy your watch.
- I could do this, right?
- Is that a clock?
I'll draw a clock.
No, it's a child.
She doesn't draw the time, or the hands. 
What does that mean?
That her mind is quite unstructured.
For example, if I were to go to your home
I'm sure her closet is unstructured, winter with summer clothing, underwear with... 
Total confusion.
Atotal confusion of space.
What's a clock or closet for?
Spaces for underwear and shirts.
But I never mix them together.
- It's all mixed together.
- Right.
- How would you draw 10:10?
- Yes.
Here? 
10:10?
I don't know.
How'd you draw a clock?
I don't know.
Let me have a look.
I have to look at my watch.
I have a watch.
- That isn't very scientific.
- No. 
This goes like this.
And now like this.
- Atriangle.
- That's 10:10?
How silly!
My mind is a mess.
It's strange that documents of 1940 include one of 1983.
Maria Rodr'guez, accompanied by her son Jose Arroniz, residing in Gavà, declares that Juan Arroniz was her husband and requests a war widow's pension.
Barcelona, January, 1983.
Grandfather had formed a family before meeting grandma, and that was concealed for over 60 years.
- Have you spoken to that family?
- No.
It's indispensable.
Carla, it's indispensable to talk to them.
You can't complete that portrait if you're lacking the testimony or rejection of his first wife and of your...
- She must be dead by now.
- Of their descendents.
Your family lived the illegal part;
the other, the legal part.
Aworker in Gavà, in the CNT, who does a series of things, etc.
The war breaks out, he disappears from this family and creates another, which is your family.
It's very important to know the rest.
Grandma with Alzheimer, Mom with presenile Alzheimer...
- Does that mean I too?
- You have more possibilities than I.
I have no one with Alzheimer's, just a grandmother who developed it at 90.
You have more than people who have no one in the family, or less than if your mother had had 4 or 5 brothers,
2 brothers of hers, or sisters of your grandmother would have had Alzheimer's at a younger age.
But your family is so limited that you're 3 women and a child.
My search concludes here, with a name, surname and an address.
Arroniz Moreno, D. D is for Dolores, Juan Arroniz's sister.
Only she can tell me what he was like.
She's my great aunt, my mother's aunt.
At 97, Dolores does the same route almost daily.
This pharmacy had been the union headquarters of her brother, Juan.
What does she know about us?
Probably nothing.
Arroniz's sister tells she went to visit her brother one day.
There she saw a woman.
Could she have been Leonor?
That may have been the last time they saw Juan Arroniz.
At 5 a.m. The convict, Juan Arroniz Moreno, 34 years old, born in Murcia, was turned over to the leader of the firing squad.
While visiting Dolores, I saw Arroniz's face for the first time.
She cried remembering her brother.
Then I realized she had nothing to do with us.
My family was another, and he was still a stranger to me.
[Severe cognitive shortage] [With an acute]
[Aphasic-apraxic-agnosic-amnesic] [Syndrome.]
[Mont-ros is in my heart.]
[What's going through your head?
]
[He is dead.]
[Husband? 
No way.]
[You're 3 women and a child.]
63 years after Arroniz's death, my grandmother died.
On the day of Leonor's burial we had breakfast at this bar.
When about to leave, I discovered an old black and white picture.
I realized it was Campo de la Bota, where they executed Arroniz.
From my visit to his sister I received the most important.
My grandfather's face.
It's as if he's looking at me and saying:
"How the hell did you get this far?"
My son, Mateo, was born since I started the shoot.
He has broken the family tradition ofwomen only, and Leonor gave him her blue eyes.
I dedicate these images to my mother, Ana.
I wish I could have finished the film before her closet was so untidy.

[ Birds Chirp ]
[ Mumbles Dreamily ]
What?
Oh, I was dreaming about cakes.
Did you have odd dreams when you were pregnant?
Not about cakes, but I had some pretty odd dreams.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. 
I'm so sorry.
- It's alright.
- Lauren, I'm in your bed.
- I had a nightmare.
- About cakes?
No.
About babies.
It was really vivid.
I must've come in here and dozed off.
It's alright.
It's more than alright.
Thanks.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
PHIL: 
Lauren? 
You awake?
Shit. 
Just a minute!
- I should go.
- Shit.
PHIL: 
Fresh pastries for breakfast.
Will I go and put on the...
Morning.
Morning.
Do you mind?
Have you ever heard of a telephone?
I didn't want to wake you.
Or knocking?
I was trying to be helpful, alright?
So... 
What's the story?
- With what?
- Popsy. 
What's her face?
- Heather.
- What's she still doing here?
She's staying here for a while.
She split with her partner, I asked her to move in.
Yeah? 
What happened?
Did she stab him?
- Her.
- Eh?
- Her partner was her girlfriend.
- She's a lesbian?
Yes, not that it's anybody's business.
Jesus.
Well, what are you doing with her?
She's just a friend.
What?
Does she work at the casino too?
Hmm?
Um, do you want sugar?
Since when do I take sugar?
[ Music Plays ]
Good luck.
- Hank, hi.
- Hey.
This is a surprise.
Yeah. 
Well, things didn't quite work out with Rebecca.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Mmm. 
I think I overwhelmed her.
At least the ego's intact.
Have a nice evening.
Lauren, are you booked right now?
- No, actualy, I'm not.
- How about a performance appraisal?
I'm a pretty harsh judge these days.
I'll take my chances.
Come on. 
I think room two's available.
Now, nice and slow, remember?
[ Both Moan ]
[ Both Sigh ]
Was that worth an elephant stamp, or what?
It's not exact science, Hank.
There's always room for improvement.
I'm glad we did this.
There is something else I wanted to talk to you about.
- Oh?
- This place is for sale.
What?
And I have a group of buyers who are very keen.
What do you mean, you've got a group of buyers?
I'm a business broker.
That's what I do.
I'm acting for some potential buyers.
Anyway, these people, they like the figures, but they don't really know the industry.
So they're looking for some kind of structure that might include the workers.
Like, say, if you and some of the other girls could...
How much money are we talking?
Well, it's like buying a house.
You only need the deposit.
The venture borrow the rest.
And we become part of that venture.
Yep. 
That's what they're looking at.
What do you reckon?
Well...
Timing could be good for me.
So why don't you ask around?
Hmm?
Do you always mix business with pleasure?
No.
But I will in the future.
[ Musical Tone ]
[ Mobile Phone Rings ]
Hey. 
Where are you?
Um, I'm busy.
I can't explain right now.
What do you mean you can't explain?
Nick, the money's gone.
What?
I'll make the money back. 
I promise you I'll pay back every cent.
What do you mean the money's gone? 
It's 300 fucking grand.
Have you got a gambling problem, or something?
- I have to go.
- Hey, whoa, whoa.
Hang on a second. 
You can't just dump this on me and then piss off.
I just want my old life back, Nick.
You know?
Where no-one gets stabbed in restaurants.
What has that got to do with anything?
I'm sorry. 
I have to go.
Mel, wait...
How's it going, Dad?
The tax figures stack up?
Yep, they stack up.
Right up our arse.
But you can cover it, right?
Hey, you know what?
Just fucking back off, will you?
I've got enough shit going on without you adding to it.
OK.
It's about owning a piece in this place.
It's an opportunity to become more than the workers.
I mean, that's why I called you in, Chloe, to see if you're interested.
Yeah, I just have to think about it.
Well, we kind of need to act fast.
You know, Nat should be in on this.
She's really good with money.
I can't believe she didn't tell us about it. 
She must've known.
Well, not necessarily.
I mean, Nick's a devious bastard.
- What about Mel?
- Not answering her phone.
Don't look at me.
She hasn't been home for weeks.
OK. 
Well, I'm interested, but I'll let you know.
- Alright, see you, girls.
- ALL: 'Bye.
I just don't understand how we're meant to raise all this money.
Tippi, it's as much as you can put in.
We don't have to all be the same, as long as we come up with 10%.
We got 10% of the business, we get 10% of the profit.
And we all know how much this place makes.
I really like the sound of that.
You know, something on the side while I'm being a mum.
- Mm-hm.
- I have to think about it.
OK. 
Well, as soon as you decide, let me know.
I have to get the paperwork organised.
- I've got a client.
- Yep.
- You know, you're very sexy.
- Hmm?
You. 
When you take charge and talk about money. 
It's very sexy.
- Heather, I'm not a lesbian.
- What?
I haven't...
I'm not attracted to women.
Sexually, or any other way.
I'm not gay.
Oh. 
Neither am I. I just love pussy.
- Now you're making fun of me.
- Yeah.
You're being a dickhead.
Nat, how much money are you holding for me?
Uh, there's a bit there. 
Why?
Um, can you give me a ballpark?
Tippi, I'm busy.
I'd have to look it up.
This is really important, Nat.
- Why?
- Because I need to buy something.
Can you put it on your credit card?
I really don't have time right now.
No, I need a minimum of $10,000.
- Want to tell me what this is about?
- No.
- How much have I got?
- I don't know, Tippi.
I'm not getting paid to be your accountant.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
So what do you think?
It'll be a way of staying in the business without maybe having to work.
Is that what it means?
Well, maybe. 
Eventually.
I've been thinking about something else.
- I want to buy the Salmon.
- The what?
Black Salmon Studios.
Is that wise? 
You always tell me studios don't make money.
Yeah, I know.
As well as recording facilities, the Salmon's also got rehearsal rooms.
So you're always got money coming in.
Do you have that kind of money?
Well, it's doable.
I've been getting a fair bit of ad work lately.
And I was thinking maybe you might want to come in with me.
Are you good with money, Josh?
I don't know. 
Are you?
Yeah. 
Yeah, I think I am.
I don't suppose you, uh had any thoughts about my other little idea?
You'll be the first to know.
Alright, cool.
Hold it like this. 
That's right.
- How does it feel?
- Mmm, good.
- Is that good for you?
- Yep.
Now steady, and take a step and...
What the hell is going on here?
Oh, shit.
Oh, whoa.
Do you know this person?
I'm his wife, you cheap whore.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I am not cheap.
You lying bastard.
You have sex with whores.
No, she's a...
I was helping her with her kicking.
Jasmine! 
Ow!
Jasmine, cut it out!
I'll cut it out, alright, and I'll kill you.
I'll kill both of you.
Um, I'm just gonan leave you guys in there to talk this to talk this through.
You know, some of us are actually working here.
Hey, listen to this.
Mr Yuan's victory in the ballot was a shock, as pre-selection was expected to go to Les Danzenick, the popular local man.
What?
- Petey won.
- Our rubber-loving friend.
And new local member.
He's cancelled all his appointments.
I wonder if he's wearing his rubber undies in this photo?
You know, it's obvious why they want him for parliament.
He'll just rubber stamp everything.
Hi.
Nat, how much do you think this place would go for it it was sold?
I don't know.
The fit-out alone is expensive.
Why?
Apparently, it's on the market.
One of my clients told me.
It's gossip.
I wouldn't take any notice.
He seemed to know what he was talking about.
Would you be interested in buying a share in this place?
I would make that decision if and when it became an issue.
So I don't know, do I?
Would you excuse me?
How'd you find me?
- I bribed your driver.
- Achilles?
Mmm. 
I suspect he thought you might like to see me.
I'll sack him for that.
Come in.
Should I ask, uh, why you're not at home?
It's a long story. 
You want a tea or a coffee? 
Vodka?
How about an answer to my proposal?
- I'd like to book you.
- What, now?
You've had a fair while now.
I didn't realise you were in such a rush, Tim.
Mmm.
But the answer's no.
I can't do it.
- Really?
- Really.
I'm not gonna sleep with you, Tim.
My life's screwed up enough as it is.
Oh. 
Well, that's a shame.
Because I was hoping we could spend one last evening together.
You watch too much daytime television.
Mel, I'm getting married.
Yeah, right.
So what's her name?
Actually, no, I don't want to know.
I'm sorry, Mel.
I should've told you before.
No, no. 
You have now.
It's just that I thought you already knew.
Every magazine on earth's been snooping around.
I don't read any of that crap.
Haven't for years.
Especially nothing written about you.
You know, I think we should skip the wine and go straight for the brandy.
Except, or course, I don't actually drink brandy.
Mel, can you just...
can you just calm down a second?
Just stop a minute, OK?
- I'm fine, Tim! 
I'm fine.
- Yeah, sure you are.
Tell me what's bugging you.
Nothing to tell.
Corkscrew.
Ah, bingo.
So, you want one more for the road, huh?
That's one way of putting it, yeah.
Screw-top! 
[ Laughs ]
Here's to me.
Drinking the profits?
Yeah. 
Yep, that's it.
So you're selling the place and, as usual, I'm the last to know.
Who told you that?
I'm not selling the place, Nat.
Just... exploring the possibilities.
And if I do there'll be something in it for you.
[ Laughs ]
You gonna look after me, Dad?
Yeah, of course.
I never wanted you here in the first place.
I'll be out of a job.
You're a natural.
You'll get another one, easy.
I don't want another job.
I love this place. 
I love the girls.
I love the clients.
I love every sick weirdo that walks through that door.
You might be on the papers, but I'm the soul of this place.
And you, you just treat it like a personal lolly shop.
The money, girls...
I've never been involved with anyone before. 
You know that.
You love her, don't you?
It happens.
You like a handful, don't you, Dad?
So...
It's come to this.
I'm not done yet.
I'll drink to that.
Cheers.
I can't.
Can't what?
I can't not do this again.
I can't imagine it.
Shh.
It's true. 
It's true.
That's good.
- That's good.
- [ Gasps ]
You used to stay here when we first met, remember?
So it's absolutely certain.
- Hmm?
- You, getting married.
Oh.
Any last-minute regrets?
So who is she?
- Victoria Cameron.
- Victoria? 
Oh.
- The Western Australian Camersons.
- Mmm.
That's good. 
At least she's bringing something to the table.
- Well, her father is.
- It's all tied up in trust.
Just make sure you watch your back.
There'll be a prenup.
Just another deal, Tim?
No, I really like her.
Good.
She certainly gets around.
She's everywhere.
I hope not.
Um, can we not talk about this right now?
Sure. 
Whatever you want.
Will you tell me one thing, though?
And you have to promise to tell me the truth.
I was never in the running, was I?
That's not a question that means anything.
Come on, it's OK.
I was never even in the ballpark.
Mum, don't lie to me.
They want you to go back to work.
No, they don't.
It's not gonna happen.
Well, I think you should.
I don't think you should have to give up just because of me.
- Is that right?
- I love that you're a prostitute.
But what would I know?
I'm asleep.
I don't even know what we're talking about.
[ Goat BAAS ]
[ Goat BAAS ]
[ Gasps ]
- Hey, hey, hey!
- [ Sobs ]
- Stop, stop, stop!
- [ Continues Sobbing ]
Stop, stop!
- Are you OK?
- No.
What's happened?
Josh, I think my brain's gonna explode.
Why?
I just had a dream about when I ran away from home.
You know, with that truck driver.
Baby, we've been through this.
I knew what I was doing.
I did.
But at the time I thought this is an improvement on anything else in my life.
Because the rest was a total disaster.
Come here.
That's why I did it.
Because I wanted a life.
I know.
And then this nun came into work the other night and I spanked her.
- Right.
- And all I could see was me spanking myself as punishment for what I do.
You have to stop being so hard on yourself.
And I keep seeing goats.
I know. 
You keep talking about them in your sleep.
It was the first thing I saw after that truckie.
This goat, just staring and judging me.
I don't care what you do.
If you want to go back to work, you go back to work.
And I'm not gonna hassle you about that.
Come here.
Come here.
Shh.
Do you really want to get married?
Yes.
But not to somebody that thinks I'm a goat.
No, seriously.
If I went back to work, would you still want to marry me?
Are you gonna make me wear a suit?
You look great.
Yeah.
I feel it.
- New phone.
- Yeah.
Smashed the other one.
Alright. 
Well, that'll explain it.
Why I haven't able to reach you.
I'm really sorry about the money.
Don't worry about it.
232's on the market now.
Shit, is that my fault?
It's mine, for not paying my tax.
I will pay back every penny.
I will work twice as hard as I've ever worked, I promise.
Is that where you've been, Mel? 
Working?
- No.
- Then where?
I've been in a hotel trying to figure out who I am.
- By yourself?
- Why the fuck does that matter?
It matters, OK? 
It matters.
I'm sorry. 
I made a mistake.
- Oh, shit. 
Mel, don't. 
Don't!
- I'm sorry.
- Will you not...
- Stop it, Mick!
OK. 
Money's gone, alright?
I don't care.
If you think this is about money, you don't know me.
I need you to talk to me, Mel.
Give me the full picture.
I need to know where I fit in.
You're getting married.
Are you cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I am.
Except?
Except what?
Except, Bonnie, I can read you like a book.
Well, that means you'll be my stepfather, right?
Yeah.
- [ Laughs ] I guess so.
- Well...
You're not gonna get all stepfather on me, are you?
Like yell at me to do my homework or ground me or tell me what boys to go out with?
Um, that last part...
yeah, probably.
OK. 
Well, I'll just tell you to fuck off.
- But you already do that.
- That won't change.
Fine.
Are you OK with me not being so cool, not a rock star anymore?
- Were you ever?
- [ Laughs ]
Ouch!
What about if I became an accountant?
Would you love me any less?
Yeah.
Mmm, I would too.
I hate accountants.
[ Laughs ]
- I love you, though.
- Mmm.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- No, listen. 
Please, listen.
I need you to help me.
I just want to know why.
I need to understand why my husband comes to you for sex.
Do you have sex with him?
Yeah, of course I do.
- Do you like it?
- [ Laughs ]
Why wouldn't I?
He's Trent Davis!
He won the club's Best and Fairest last year.
it doesn't last very long.
That's how Trent likes it.
What am I supposed to do?
You need help from a professional.
Remember, it's a game of four quarters and you just play it out.
The result's the result but it can't be the focus and take each kick as it comes and never, ever, ever look at the clock - just find the zone and stay there.
Oh. 
Stay there, Trent.
Just stay there.
I'm not going anywhere, babe.
Not a chance.
Good. 
Never sorry about being an undersized player.
It takes all types.
Er, try something different.
Oh, I love your game, Trent.
Confidence and surprise are always your best attacks.
Oh! 
Oooh, Trentie!
Good.
And remember to keep trying.
- Do it over and over and over.
- Baby!
- And over again.
- [ Both Pant ]
- Oooh, yes!
- Oooh!
- Oh, yes!
- [ Laughs ]
- I love my job!
- [ Both Moan ]
PHIL: 
End of an era.
Where do I sign?
Down here and there.
No regrets?
Don't get me going.
When does it go on the market?
Tomorrow.
That quick?
Must be under the pump.
Oh, just doing business stuff and the new domestic situation's not exactly cheap.
You heard from the kids?
Yes.
Kate phones me every day.
- Really?
- Mmm.
Ash not so much, but when he does, we talk for ages.
How do you think they're doing?
They're living in America, Phil.
What can I say?
Well, I'll get us a couple of drinks to celebrate.
[ Phone Rings ]
Hello.
How much money have you got?
Sorry?
You and your syndicate.
I was wondering, is there room for me?
Well, yes. 
Yes, there is.
Does that mean I'm in?
Absolutely.
That's our 10%. 
That's great.
OK. 
Um, I'll give you all the details at work.
'Bye.
'Bye.
Phil.
Oh, we're having a private conversation in there so...
Cool with me.
How's the hand?
Yeah, it's fine.
I should've just gone for the heart but I didn't know if you had one.
Yeah, right.
You know, I thought it was a cliche but it turns out to be true.
What's that?
All you people - you hate men.
All my people?
Yeah, Lauren told me.
You're a lesbian.
Oh. 
Is that a problem for you, Phil?
[ Laughs ] I don't care but this is my house so I really don't need the whole anti-men thing.
I'm in Lauren's house and I'm not anti-men in general, Phil,
I'm just anti the really dull, controlling ones.
You know, why don't you get a dog, get a haircut?
Put on the uniform so we know what you're all about?
Why don't you have a midlife crisis and run away with the secretary?
Oh, wait - you've already done that!
You don't know what you're talking about so shut your mouth.
Maybe take the kids too - really hit your wife where it hurts.
- Jesus! 
Don't touch me.
- Oh, s...
[ Screams ]
- Phil!
- She fell over the bloody stool.
You alright?
Oh, shit! 
Shit!
For Godsakes, Phil.
She's pregnant.
I am so sorry.
It was Ally who wanted to do this.
But they become part of you so quickly.
Yes, they do.
I should think of a name to honour the baby.
I need a name.
Yeah.
Come here.
[ Sighs ]
How is she?
She's asleep.
[ Sighs ]
You're lucky she didn't call the police.
I had no idea. 
How could I?
So it would've been alright to assault her if she wasn't pregnant?
- You told me she was a lesbian.
- So?
You don't expect lesbians to be pregnant.
She's also a sex worker, if you want to know everything.
She works in the same place I do.
Yeah, right.
I'm serious, Phil.
That's what I do for a living.
I work in a brothel.
And one that's actually OK and I'm gonna buy a share in the place when this house is sold.
- You're a prostitute?
- Sex worker.
Took me a while to get the hang of it but somewhere along the line, I got the hang of it.
I stopped being, what did you call it?
"A dud root."
And now people pay me ot have sex with them and yes, I'm OK with that and apparently I'm very good, if demand is anything to go by.
Do the kids know?
We shouldn't have to burden our children with everything, now, should we, Phil?
This is disgusting.
Absolutely bloody disgusting.
I think you've cornered that market, Phil, all on your own.
Yeah, yep.
What?
[ Clears Throat ]
Can I call you back? 
OK.
What are you doing here?
I have a proposal for you.
Victoria's due here in an hour.
That's OK.
Won't take long, I promise.
[ Clears Throat ]
What is it?
I need some cash.
What's it for?
Oh, you could call it a going-away present or you could call it keeping you and me out of the papers.
You wouldn't dare.
What am I talking about?
Of course you would.
How much do you want?
I didn't come here to blackmail you, Tim. 
Honestly.
I just have a large financial problem and I thought you could help me with it.
How much?
Well, how much am I worth?
I beg your pardon?
[ Laughs ] You're an extremely wealthy man, Tim.
You should know how much things are worth.
[ Laughs ]
OK.
Er, can I write you a cheque or do you need cash?
Cheque's fine.
[ Sighs ]
You know, it's traditional in most cultures for the bridegroom to receive presents, not to give them out.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, we've never been traditional.
No, I guess not.
This is yours plus a little present.
It's a decent-sized cheque.
Yeah, it is.
Where'd you get it?
A little windfall so I wanted to give you back what's yours.
Plus I don't want you to sell 232.
I want us to be partners.
I don't want your money, Mel.
Why?
I don't know where it's been.
What if I told you it was a going-away present?
That I will never, ever see him again?
Why should I believe you?
Then don't.
Like, what does, um, he get out of that?
He gets to keep his name out of the papers.
- No shit?
- Yep, no shit.
I earned this money, Nick.
Every single cent.
And behind that pseudo-gangster bullshit of yours, you actually know its value.
What, and you'd give up working?
Yeah, I would, if you'd give up the knives and the tax evasion.
We'd run a legitimate business.
Both of us. 
Hands-on.
You know, we could do this, Nick.
We could really try and make this work.
Yeah, and what about us - aside from the business?
Well, if you promise to stop stabbing people,
I'll go house hunting for us.
Hmm.
If you ever see this bloke again, I'll stab you both.
Several times.
[ Laughs ]
I'm thinking about a house with a garden.
What, are you crazy?
Yep.
[ Knock on Door ]
Heather.
Alex is here.
Go in.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming.
Well, I charge double for outcalls.
I'm sorry.

And no hair.

Hello. 
Who's there?
Whoever it is, I'm armed.
- Natalie.
- Peter.
Jesus! 
Are you trying to scare me to death?
- I've got something for you.

I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be.
Me neither.

Hey.

[ Screams ]
[ Giggles ] OK, OK, OK.
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Mmm.
Oooh.
- Mmm. [ Kisses ] - [ Laughs ]
- Are you making breakfast?
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- [ Laughs ]
I want toast and coffee.
Hey, guess what?
I slept like a baby.
And I want an omelette.
[ Groans Softly ]
No goats, no nightmares.
Mmm, tomato and onion.
In fact, not a single goat to be seen.
Melted cheese and some ham.
[ Laughs ]
- Listen to us.
- Hmm?
- We don't need to get married, Josh.
- Mmm.
We're already there.
[ Laughs ]
Hmm.
[ Birds Chirp ]
We're here today to acknowledge baby Jessie.
Conceived with hope and carried with love.
A tiny miracle that reminds us about the fragility of life and dreams.
[ Cries ]
Some things are not meant to make sense.
Some things are just sent to remind us to to live and to care and to love.
Thank you for inviting me into your life.
[ Sniffs ]
That will always be the sweetest gift.
I really think you'll be excited by this property.
It truly is something a bit special.
Yeah.
Oh, look, Nick's running a bit late. 
Sorry.
Hmm.
- Do you want to take a look around?
- No, no. 
I'll wait, if that's OK.
Sure. 
No rush.
[ Laughs ] Yes, Hank.
No... 
Yes, they're all here.
I will tell them.
[ Sighs ]
Our offer's been submitted.
We're about to become partners!
- [ Laughs ] 
- Whoo!
Hey, Alex.
- Can you take a photo for us?
- Sure. 
Yeah. 
Come on.
Quick.

ALL: 
Cheers!

- I'm sorry.
- How long have you been there?
- A few seconds.
- I was listening to you hum in there.
- Do you know how creepy that is?
- It's not creepy.
- No, I'm serious.
I gave you a key, but next time maybe you could knock, ring the doorbell, give me a little warning?
[PANTING]
What?
I love you.
Becca, I do. 
I...
I love you.
Wow, Justin. 
Thank you.
I better go get dressed.
Radio interview at 10, more election predictions.
- Okay.
- Then the call about renewable energy.
- What's the tracking on that today?
- Up four.
- Excellent.
- Oh, speaking of what's on the ballot,
- I prepared a statement against Prop 8.
- I'm already on the record against that.
I know you've been here a week, but the senator released his position on the act four months ago.
No one remembers four months ago.
People are paying attention now.
- Look, we realize this is your issue.
- My issue?
The Supreme Court of California ruled it is illegal to discriminate against gay marriage.
Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, Robert, I thought you Republicans were all about respecting State's rights.
He's got you on that, Stu.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Sorry to interrupt you, senator.
Your 2:00 got pushed to noon.
- Tell them he's busy.
- No, no. 
I have to be at that.
I agree with Stu. 
We've already released our statement on Prop 8.
We're not coming out again.
- No pun intended.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna take the interview in the car.
And tell him about the other.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- All right, Kitty's brother.
- You can call me Kevin.
When you start referring to your boss as "senator," I will.
In the meantime, talk to this reporter from the Sacramento Tribune.
He's threatening to publish some cockamamie story about Governor Kern and the senator involved in some sort of intimate relationship.
- What kind of intimate relationship?
- The schtupping kind.
- The story is he's schtupping her.
- I know what schtupping is.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't it?
Let me know how it goes.
MAN:
No, I agree with you, you know?
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
- Excuse me. 
Hi.
- Hi.
Wow, I just... 
I can't believe this is actually happening.
I mean, of course, it should've happened ten minutes ago.
- Do you think anything's wrong?
- No, no.
I'm sure she's just still in her appointment, and she'll be here as soon as she can.
Well, I hope she's not lost.
I mean, this hospital is like a maze.
You know, Robert, I think we should've brought her a gift.
I mean, maternity clothes are insanely expensive, and she shouldn't have to pay for that all by herself.
- This is just her first visit.
- She's our birth mom.
She's probably young and might not have a lot of money.
We're gonna have plenty of time to, you know, shower her with gifts.
[SIGHS]
You're right. 
You're right.
Thank you. 
I'm...
You're right.
WOMAN:
Fine.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- Ah. 
Hi.
- Hi.
I'm so sorry, I thought that we reserved this room for a private meeting.
- We did. 
Sorry.
- Oh, with me. 
Heh.
I'm Trish Evans, your birth mom.
Oh.
Oh, oh, wow. 
Yeah.
- It's so... 
It's so nice to meet you.
- Yes.
Yeah, indeed, doctor.
- Screw Holly.
- I'm out of the closet now, remember?
You should've seen her, wielding George Lafferty's phone number around as if it was some weapon against my family.
I know. 
You were terrified.
Well, I was.
Bringing William's illegitimate son into the mix was not something I wanted to do, and, ha-ha, too bad for Holly, it's not gonna happen.
What are you making anyway?
Cupcakes for Tommy and Julia's party tonight.
I'm not saying telling George was easy.
It wasn't.
He was devastated at first, and then, in the end, he decided he didn't want Ryan to know anything about it.
Even if William is Ryan's biological father, George raised him.
- That's all that matters.
- Right. 
Okay. 
So pick a card.
Are you even listening to me?
George Lafferty doesn't want anything to do with our family.
The whole sordid business is over, done, poof.
Right, exactly, poof.
Now, come on, pick a card.
- Remember what it is. 
Okay, you got it?
- Yeah.
Put it back. 
Don't tell me.
Great.
You're like a child.
You're so excited we're going to Magic Manor tonight.
The last time I went there, Tommy was years 10 years old,
I taught him his first trick.
Yes, I'm excited.
He's celebrating his anniversary there tonight. 
Are you kidding?
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Oh. 
George.
Oh, no. 
No, no.
I was just thinking about you.
Now?
Really?
Okay.
Could you do it over here?
Okay. 
Fine. 
See you in a while.
What?
He's having second thoughts.
He's thinking maybe he should tell Ryan the truth.
There goes poof.
[SIGHS HEAVILY]
TRISH: 
I take it from your reaction you didn't read my application.
- No, but we did.
- We did.
- We read it, like, a hundred times.
- A lot. 
A lot.
I think that when you said your goal was to become a surgeon, we didn't know that you actually were a surgeon.
We thought it was more of a long-term thing.
And, you know, that you were still a student in Missouri.
Well, I'm from Missouri, but I'm doing my residency here.
It's a great surprise.
What's your specialty?
- Neuro.
- Wow, a brain surgeon.
- Not yet. 
I'm only in my second year.
- Congratulations.
- This is gonna be a smart baby.
- Yeah.
I can only speak for half of the chromosomes.
Oh, so the father wasn't exactly a neurosurgeon himself?
- Honey, the father was listed as unknown.
- I know.
We hooked up at a conference.
Not my finest hour.
- It happens.
- And I know you guys said ethnicity doesn't matter.
- No.
- But he was white, and my mom's Korean, and my dad's black, so I guess you're in for a surprise.
[ALL CHUCKLE]
Yeah, so brain surgery.
That must be a lot of hard work.
Is that why you made an adoption plan?
Medicine's my baby.
I don't have the time or energy for another.
Was that decision difficult?
Not really. 
I weighed the pros and cons, and for me, adoption made sense.
- Right, right. 
And how about your family?
- Oh, completely supportive.
You won't have any long-Iost relatives bugging you.
- Oh, we're not at all worried about that.
- Yeah, no. 
I didn't mean it like that.
[PAGER VIBRATING]
Oh, it's the ER.
You guys are great.
I feel really good about this.
- I gotta run.
- No, no, wait, wait.
I feel like we just got started. 
Is that it?
I have to travel to Houston for a seminar tomorrow.
I could do dinner.
We have the anniversary, but we could cancel.
But this is much more important.
No, that would be great.
Okay, I'll call you guys when whatever train wreck downstairs is over. 
How's that?
- Fantastic.
- All right.
- Thanks.
ROBERT: 
Thank you.
- She is fantastic.
- Yeah.
- She's perfect.
- Yeah. 
No, she is.
What, you don't think so?
What? 
No. 
I'm... 
I just, you know, I...
She did not admit to having any doubt.
Don't you think that's a little weird?
No, I don't think it's weird.
I think it's decisive.
Look, this... 
Honey, this is all good.
Don't over think it. 
Really. 
Okay?
- Yeah.
- It's great.
- All right, I gotta go. 
I'll see you later.
- Okay.
[DOOR OPENS]
- George, can't I get you a cup of tea?
- No, that's okay.
I really don't want to take up too much of your time.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm the one who opened Pandora's box.
What is it they say, ignorance is bliss?
Yes, ignorance is bliss.
Total and complete and utter bliss.
George, maybe you were right the first time.
Maybe you should put it in the box, lock it up, throw away the key.
Let the past be the past.
That's what I thought I wanted.
Then Ryan called, and the whole conversation,
I felt like I was lying to him.
You wanted to protect him.
That was your first instinct.
George, I think you should go with that instinct.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think it's me I'm trying to protect.
Ryan struggled growing up.
It never felt like he fit in.
Is this why?
Would knowing help him make sense of things?
And then I think again how hard he took his mother's death.
And now to tell him his whole identity was based on a lie, a lie she told him.
I don't think he can handle that.
That's why I called you.
That's why I can't sleep at night.
[TIMER BEEPING]
That's the cupcakes.
And you really look like you could use one.
At this point, I could eat the whole batch.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, let's just start with one.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Yeah.
- Kevin Walker?
- Yes.
Spencer Travis from the Sacramento Tribune.
Thanks for coming by.
Take a seat.
It's good to see that nepotism's alive and well.
Okay, let's set the record straight.
I didn't get this job...
I'd rather set the record straight on something else, like that rumor floating around about the governor's affair.
We got a tip, camped out at the Hotel Gerard.
Did you try the restaurant? 
Four stars.
- I hear it's fantastic.
- I've got photographs.
That's Governor Kern arriving at 11 a.m. Through the back door.
That's 20 minutes later.
Senator McCallister through the same door.
- They both checked in under aliases.
- Irrelevant.
- They're both public figures.
- That doesn't seem irrelevant to me.
It seems like they don't want anyone to know.
You know, there's an election going on.
I'm sure you could get a bigger story than this.
Heh. 
Well, this is a big story.
It's not as big as the libel suit you'd be facing if you run with it.
That's interesting.
So far you've given me irrelevant, and now you've given me libel, but not once have you denied it.
[CHUCKLES]
- Look, I'm denying it.
- I'm gonna give you 24 hours to tell me what happened at that meeting, and then I'm running the story.
Fine.
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]
All right, so call ICU, make sure they've got a bed ready.
Excuse me, Trish.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
Dr. Evans.
Hi. 
I'll meet you in postop.
Kitty. 
What's going on?
Well, I was just wondering if it would be possible for me to ask you a couple of questions before dinner.
Well, I've got about three minutes, so shoot.
Okay, okay.
Well, this might sound silly, but I've always been under the assumption that our birth mother would be... 
Um...
Well, you know, some kind of messed up kid.
But you... 
See, you could do this.
I mean, even if you work nonstop, you could hire a nanny.
Ha-ha. 
I don't want a nanny.
I just keeping thinking about what you said this morning, how your career is your baby, and I used to say the same thing, and then I changed my mind.
So I just wanted to make sure that you've, you know, thought this through.
Kitty, I'm a surgeon.
I think everything through.
For now, but what about when you finish your residency?
You know what happens to egg quality.
I really don't need a reproductive health lecture.
Oh, no. 
I'm... 
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
All I'm saying is that things change.
I mean, what's going to happen when you see the heartbeat or you see the little toes or...
- I've seen the toes.
- Okay, well, what about when your friends all start having babies, and all they talk about are strollers and onesies and Baby Mozart?
Okay, stop, stop.
Look, they make us sit down for a reason:
So we can see if this works for both of us.
- Right.
- Obviously, it doesn't.
No, no, no.
That is not what I'm saying at all.
- I just wanna be sure that you're sure.
- Kitty, I deal with enough neuroses with my patients. 
I'm sorry.
Well, wait. 
What about dinner?
I've been on call for 36 hours.
Let's not waste each other's time.
Can we talk?
Talk to Stu.
I don't weigh in by the hour.
That reporter has photographs of you and the governor sneaking into Hotel Gerard.
Kevin,
I spent $40 million last year trying to get my face in front of the American people.
I'd like to think that I can't sneak in anywhere.
Are you having an affair?
Kitty's my sister. 
I have a right to ask.
You know, this morning it was the antigay marriage initiative, now it's your sister.
This job isn't about your personal issues.
It's about you supporting and protecting my professional agenda.
- I can't do that if I don't have the facts.
- The facts are
I met with the governor to discuss a sensitive political issue.
- Beyond that, it is confidential.
- Oh, okay.
And the meeting you ran off to this morning, is that confidential too?
That meeting was with our birth mother, who, by the way, happens to be amazing.
But if she picks up the paper tomorrow and reads a slanderous story about me and another government official, she could change her mind.
So if you're really concerned with your sister, not to mention your job, you'll suck it up and you'll figure out a way to fix it.
And you better figure out a way to trust me, or this isn't gonna work out.
If you don't mind.
[PLAYING GUITAR CHORDS]
Did you guys read the focus-group report?
The web applications aren't user-friendly enough.
No way.
A chimp could navigate that program.
Well, we didn't test it on a chimp.
Listen, people just want to enter a product, and find out the greenest way to get it.
- What'd they think of our graph?
- The colors are confusing.
If the asparagus is flown in from Argentina, it's red, but if it's trucked in from Mexico, it's orange.
It's because it's all about mileage.
More mileage, more gas, more damage to the environment.
I don't understand why that's difficult.
Because people think it is. 
Page 26.
Oh, nice, E.
- Draw her a rocket ship.
- Look, I don't need to see his rocket ship.
- Heh.
- Nice.
[CHUCKLES]
Whoa, hey.
What's with this magic stuff?
It's for my brother's anniversary party at Magic Manor.
Listen, guys, could we please focus?
I don't know. 
We may have lost him.
You're looking at the magic club president.
I don't care if he's David Blaine.
And the music?
I married a failed musician.
I'd really prefer not to be working with one.
- This is our process.
- Well, it's not mine, okay?
At my house, no magic tricks, no music, no fricking rocket ships or crazy robots.
[PHONE RINGS]
I have two kids, a mortgage.
I don't have time for this.
- Hello.
- All right, I'm panicked.
The parlor magician canceled on the day of the party.
- What's a parlor magician?
ETHAN: 
Oh, I know.
It's the guy from Victorian times who walked around the parlor doing tricks.
JULIA: 
So much for the magic of Tommy and Julia.
What's a magic party without a magician?
It's a disaster, that's what it is.
- I think I might have a substitute for you.
- You do?
- Sarah, how is that even possible?
SARAH: 
It's magic.
He'll be there at 6.
This is just so crazy.
Ryan has five half siblings.
He doesn't even know who they are.
That's not how life's supposed to go.
You and I, we're the parents, before you know it, we'll be dead and gone.
- Oh, now that's cheerful.
- You know what I mean.
Your siblings are with you for the long haul.
Well, I can't argue with you there.
My brother Saul is my best friend, and my kids have always had each other.
They fight, but they've always had each other.
I actually wish I could meet them.
It's like I need a crystal ball or something.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.
Why don't you come to the party tonight?
You could see for yourself.
Maybe it would help you make a decision.
It would.
But then what if I decide not to pursue it?
Your whole family would know.
Well, no one knows you except Kitty, and she's not even gonna be there.
So we just tell them I'm some handsome stranger you picked up?
Yeah. 
Bob.
Bob? 
No, I don't want to be Bob.
How about Mick Jagger?
Well, I don't think they'd believe that.
How about Bob Jagger?
And we met... 
Wait, where did we meet?
A widow's mixer.
First you wanna a rock 'n' roll star, and then you're trolling for widows?
How about Dylan Jagger?
You are so stuck in the '60s.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
REBECCA:
Come in.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- Just use your key.
- I thought you wanted me to ring the bell.
Seriously?
I didn't mean never use your key.
That's kind of a mixed signal, don't you think?
This is about this morning, isn't it?
- Listen, I wasn't expecting...
- Please don't explain.
- I didn't want to say it because you said it.
- Rebecca...
You got to find your moment.
I wanna find mine.
Can we just drop this?
Let's just go to the party, all right?
Everything's fine.
Great. 
Exactly what I'm in the mood for, an anniversary party. 
Awesome.
[DOOR OPENS]
Oh, hey. 
I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.
[SIGHS]
No.
- Trish canceled dinner.
- Oh.
- Did something come up at the hospital?
- No, actually, it's much worse than that.
She...
She changed her mind about the adoption.
- What are you talking about?
- Look, I know how much you loved her, but I had a very weird feeling, so I went to the hospital,
- I stopped by to see her.
- You stopped by?
I wanted to talk to her.
And the minute I brought up some issues, she pulled out on the spot.
But things were perfect.
They were more than perfect.
- That's what you thought.
- No, that's what Trish said.
And now the whole adoption is off?
What on earth did you say to her?
I just told her that I was a career woman myself, and that I didn't want to have a baby, and now I did.
I just wanted to make sure that she considered what it would feel like to give up a baby at her age.
- You mentioned her age?
- This is not my fault.
She was gonna change her mind no matter what, or she never would've reacted that way.
I don't get it.
Do you even want this?
- Of course I want this.
- Then how, after everything we've been through, when we finally get chosen by a woman who is smart and talented and more than we ever could've hoped for in a birth mother, do you choose to go and confront her on her decision?
Because we were about to get our hearts broken.
Well, if you're not ready to have your heart broken, you're not ready to be a parent.
- You don't have to walk away.
- Yeah, I do.
WOMAN 1: 
Now he did it.
WOMAN 2: 
I know.
- Tommy.
- Hey, guys.
Happy anniversary.
Yeah. 
Julia went all out.
Guess she still loves me, huh?
Must be nice.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
- What's...?
- Don't ask.
NORA: 
Hi, boys.
- Hey, Mom.
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.
- Sweetheart, hi.
- Hi, Mom.
Boys, I would like you to meet my friend Elton.
- Elton?
- It's a family name.
- Lot of people named Elton.
- No, I didn't mean it like... 
Sorry.
- I'm Tommy.
- Hi. 
Congratulations.
- I hear it's your anniversary.
- Thank you.
Tommy runs the family business.
He's the one that put the winery in, and he has the most beautiful little daughter, Elizabeth, my granddaughter.
And this is my son Justin.
WOMAN: 
I know, I shouldn't have said that.
Well, that about sums it up.
Pick a card.
- That's the one you want?
- Yes.
- You sure? 
Positive.
- Positive.
ETHAN:
Okay.
Was that your card?
JULIA: 
No way.
- How'd you do that? 
That's great.
- Thank you.
- He's great, Julia.
I know. 
Sarah found him.
I have no idea how.
You know, I have my sources.
Okay, Miss Clara the fortuneteller knew everything about me.
Knew my first pet's name started with a W.
This miniature Bijon my parents used to have.
She knew I had trouble making decisions, which is not gonna affect us and our business. 
Um...
Mm?
- Hi, I'm Kyle.
- I'm Julia.
KYLE: 
Julia, nice to meet you.
- Hi. 
Holly.
Nice to meet you.
Sarah's business partner.
- Yeah, I'm consulting for...
KYLE: 
Consulting?
You're, like, one of the founders. 
So is he.
We're starting an internet company.
Oh, I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician.
- Give it a break, Holly.
- Sarah, so who's your mom's new guy?
- Mom has a guy?
JULIA: 
You don't know?
She brought a guy.
Hmm. 
Excuse me.
Thank you.
So how do you two know each other?
- Ah-ha-ha. 
It's funny.
- No, it is.
- It's really a funny story.
- It's very funny.
SARAH: 
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- Isn't this great? 
I feel like a kid again.
- This is my beautiful daughter Sarah.
- Elton.
GEORGE: 
Hi.
- Elton.
- Mom was gonna tell us how they met.
Oh, God.
I love the "how we met" stories. 
Go on.
We were at a restaurant a... 
Not together.
We weren't together, were we?
And this man began to choke.
[BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY]
And Elton, he just went over there and gave him the Heimlich maneuver,
- just like that.
- Nora called the paramedics.
And then we started talking, and we have just so much in common.
- Hilarious.
SARAH: 
Wow, Mom.
Some guy almost dies, and you go score a date.
- Good girl.
- It's not a date, per se.
- Yeah, and don't worry. 
He was fine.
- Yeah.
- Once he spit out the fish bone.
- Ham gristle.
- Ham gristle?
- Was it fish bones?
- It was a fish bone.
- Yeah.
Oh, it was a fish bone.
I didn't even know what it was.
Okay, so why don't you kids go have some fun?
We're going to go and enjoy the magic and all that.
- Nice meeting you.
- You too, Elton.
- What was that?
- Guess mom has a new boyfriend.
Elton? 
Really?
Ah. 
I see it.
Look toward the bottom of the cup.
See how the leaves form the shape of a heart?
Sort of, if I squint.
- What does that mean?
- It means there's a great love in store.
- Someone is out there waiting for you.
- Yeah, that would be my boyfriend.
He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you."
Actually, the placement indicates the distant future.
- It could take years to meet this person.
- Years?
What about now? 
What are you saying, that Justin's love isn't great?
- I can only interpret what's here.
- You don't even know him.
I mean, you're just reading some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup.
It's not stupid, unless your spirit is closed.
My spirit is not closed.
I mean, who said that my spirit is closed?
Your spirit is closed.
Look, I know you think you're in love, but I promise, another few years, a great love will come along.
You're not even going to remember this guy.
This is wonderful, Ethan.
Great.
Oh, Kevin, you're here.
You just missed some fantastic magic.
Not a fan, remember?
I actually need your advice, okay?
You worked for your brother-in-law.
What did you do when Dad did things you didn't like?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay, you didn't tell Mom about Holly for one thing.
I didn't tell your mother because I thought I was protecting her.
My job is to protect Robert, and I'm not saying he's Dad, but he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering.
All he says is I have to trust him.
Do you?
I don't know.
We all know you're the family cynic.
I mean, certainly, that's why you hate magic.
You just are always looking for the angle.
You can't give in to the illusion.
But Robert is not an illusion.
That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself, if he's putting one over on you or if Robert is the real thing.
And by the way, Kevin, if you can't trust him, don't work for him.
- Make it, you know?
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you?
Where you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
I love you.
- You do?
- Mm-hm.
Yeah. 
God, that felt good. 
Heh.
Wow.
- Damn right, that feels good.
- Ha-ha.
I know. 
I feel like there's weight off my shoulders.
That woman had no idea what she was talking about.
GUEST: 
Yeah.
- What woman?
Nothing. 
Just this fortuneteller.
She said that you're not my great love.
Whatever.
Wait, that's why you said it, because some fortuneteller told you we were doomed?
So this is your moment?
Rebecca, this seems like a lame protest to me.
- Why are you making such a big deal?
- Well, I'm sorry, where I come from, saying "I love you" comes from the people saying it.
Okay, well, sorry.
I can't seem to say anything right.
Why don't you just write me a script?
You know what?
I'm gonna give you these back.
And when you figure it out, you let me know, all right?
- So Elton?
- Yes, Elton.
Why are you guys so hung up on his name?
Have you guys done the dance with no pants?
- Sarah.
- What? 
Come on.
One of us should be having sex, and sadly, it's not me.
Well, it's not me either.
Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together.
You brought two men.
I'm not accusing you of having a ménage à trois.
- Mom.
- Well, you're the one who brought up sex.
Well, I regret it.
Almost as much as I regret bringing Ethan and Kyle.
Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together.
Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
I don't know, Mom. 
Maybe she's right.
I mean, a start-up in this financial climate?
Bear Stearns can't even keep afloat, and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship.
- Oh, no.
SARAH: 
You think I made a mistake.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
It's bad. 
I really screwed up.
- Oh, hey.
- Kitty, what are you doing here?
I thought you were meeting with your birth mother.
- Yeah.
- Well, I... 
It's a long story.
- Well, good. 
Tell Sarah about it.
- Whoa.
- Ugh. 
What the is up with mom?
- I don't know.
She's been acting weird all night.
She brought this guy.
- Elton.
- Elton?
Exactly.
What's with the briefcase?
Robert won't give you the night off?
- Kevin has a new job.
- Yeah, he's a lawyer-turned-Republican.
- I'm still a Democrat, dumb-ass.
- Why don't you be nice?
- You'll embarrass your mother's date.
- It's not really a date.
Elton, there you are.
You know, it's such a lovely evening out.
- Why don't we take a walk?
- That sounds like a date to me.
I was really enjoying talking to your family.
- Oh. 
Hi.
- Kitty.
SARAH:
This is funny.
George?
- What are you doing here?
- This is Elton.
That's Mom's date. 
Don't be rude.
Do you want a drink?
- Ah. 
You're dating Ryan's dad?
- No, she's dating Elton Richards.
- I'm not dating him.
- What?
I'm sorry. 
Excuse me. 
No, no.
This is George Lafferty.
JUSTIN: 
What?
- Ryan's George Lafferty?
KEVIN: 
Mom.
- Mom, I knew you were hiding something.
KEVIN:
Mom.
All right, fine.
George, this is my family.
Family, this is George Lafferty.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
TOMMY: 
Unbelievable.
JUSTIN: 
I thought you...
Since when are you friends with George Lafferty?
- He kicked us out of his house.
- You were to his house?
- Look, this is really all my fault.
- No, it is not.
I invited you here to meet Ryan's half siblings.
I'm sorry we deceived you, but George needs to figure this out.
I thought meeting you might help.
What is this, a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff, Mom?
- What's going on? 
Is everything okay?
- Oh, hey, Julia.
- Yes, fine. 
It's a lovely party.
- I heard yelling.
Our family? 
No.
- We're just all catching up with George.
- You mean Elton.
How about some cupcakes?
- Can you believe our mom?
- Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore.
[SIGHS]
- Why are you so out of breath?
- I've been looking for you.
- Well, where's Scotty?
- He couldn't get time off work.
- Where's Robert?
- Robert's at home being furious.
Really? 
How furious?
I went to see our birth mother.
Oh, of course. 
Oh, good.
- Good, good, good.
- Oh, no. 
No, Kevin. 
Not good. 
Bad.
Very bad.
She changed her mind about the adoption.
She's not gonna go through with it, not with us anyway.
What, did she hear something about Robert?
No. 
No, she loved Robert.
It was me.
I showed up with all of these questions because I wanted proof
- that she wasn't gonna change her mind.
- What's wrong with wanting proof?
Well, what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me, obviously.
And she shouldn't have to.
Mm.
But it has nothing to do with Robert?
Would you stop trying to make this about Robert?
- This is about me.
- All right.
Kevin, I'm serious.
I think I made a very big mistake.
I...
I couldn't trust her and...
And now we don't have a baby.
So fix it.
MAN:
Here you go, sir.
CLARA:
Looks like someone is on the horizon.
Someone who will bring great upheaval into your life.
No, no, no. 
I thought so too, but that's wrong.
- No, this reading's clear.
- The reading is wrong.
George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation.
I can identify with that.
Well, the way these cards are spread, this person represents a threat.
Maybe it's talking about his son Ryan.
And I'm telling you right now, I am done being scared.
Siblings should meet each other.
I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him.
And I'm actually happy about that.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
That's great.
What else do they say?
Ladies and gentlemen, I know many of you don't believe in magic.
Instead, you search for an explanation.
There must be something I'm not telling you, something I'm hiding.
You're right.
Most of the time, magic is about sleight of hand, the principle of misdirection.
I make you look one way, so you forget to look the other.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Hi.
Have you seen a young woman, light brown hair, tall?
I seem to have lost my daughter.
- No, but I'll keep an eye out.
- Okay.
- What her name?
- Rebecca. 
Thanks.
Uh... 
Wait.
Are you... 
Are you Holly?
- Yeah.
- I'm George Lafferty.
Oh, my God.
You're Ryan's dad.
[CHUCKLES]
- I guess you've heard about me too.
- Yeah.
I hope you don't mind, but Nora told me about what happened with your daughter.
No, I don't mind.
It's just that she might not be the most reliable narrator.
Well, it's probably pretty complicated between you two.
No, actually, it's quite simple.
But I do know what it's like to be in your position, so if there's ever anything that I can do...
- Holly?
- Hmm?
Uh... 
I do have a few questions.
Sure.
Watch closely because with Julia's help, you're about to see something so amazing, so improbable, it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle.
Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity.
In the 1800s, European audiences saw, for the first time, people rise unassisted off...
So you called me down here.
What do you got?
There's an exit out that way.
ETHAN:
Just maybe it's magic.
With one snap of my fingers, the lovely Julia will fall into a deep, deep sleep.
[SNAPS]
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
[SNAPS]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- Nora.
- Oh! 
Oh, George. 
Sorry.
- I got sucked into watching the show.
- It's okay. 
I have to go.
Go? 
What do you mean?
You know, your family's lovely and very seductive...
Seductive?
All right, which one of them hit on you?
It's not like that.
I was right the first time.
This was a mistake.
It won't be good for Ryan, or any of us.
I'd rather leave it alone.
- I don't understand.
- Our families are what they are.
Let's not destroy anything.
Goodbye, Nora.
[CROWD APPLAUDING, CHATTERING]
[FOOTSTEPS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How was the party?
- Oh, God. 
Never a dull moment.
I'll tell you all about that later.
Robert...
I am really, really sorry.
I never should've gone to Trish without telling you.
I don't know why, but I just let my anxiety get the best of me.
And I knew how you felt about her, and I didn't want you to think that I was crazy and...
I love you when you're crazy.
But what I don't love is when you go off, you know, without me and don't tell me about it.
You know, we're gonna be parents, so we need to be...
- Trusting each other.
- I do trust you.
It's just... 
It's everybody else in the world that I don't trust.
And I just didn't know if I could do it again.
I mean, we've already lost a baby, and I...
- Oh, is that what this is all about?
- Oh, it's everything, you know?
It's all the fertility treatments that didn't work, and all the pregnancy tests that came back negative.
And I just...
I have had my heart broken.
Many times.
But I am ready to be a parent.
- I know.
- And I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna make this right with Trish.
I promise. 
I'm...
I'm gonna fix it.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- There she is.
- Good morning.
SARAH: 
Hey.
- Coffee?
Thank you.
- What time is it?
- It's on time.
- You laid down the law, remember?
- Have you guys been to bed?
Are you kidding?
I worked a night at the Magic Manor.
- That's like playing Carnegie Hall.
- Check this out.
See that? 
New web application.
Simplified, streamlined, sexy.
- And a new carbon footprint graph.
- You did this last night?
We may act like we're stupid.
- We're not.
- You don't act stupid.
- You act 20.
- We're older than that.
I know. 
Sorry.
Listen, working with you guys, it's a little bit of an adjustment.
- I have a lot at stake.
- Yeah? 
Well, so do we.
You should see our credit card bills.
We're not gonna fail.
Miss Clara last night told me we're gonna make boatloads of money.
- Heh.
- You just gotta trust the process.
Maybe you're right.
- Ethan, draw me a rocket ship.
- Yes, ma'am.
[SARAH CHUCKLES]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]
You seen the paper today?
No, I was just...
"Senator Robert McCallister had a private meeting with fellow Republican Governor Eve Kern urging her to release a strong statement against the limited marriage act in time for the general election."
- Any word of an affair?
- Nope.
Just a follow-up from the governor reaffirming all Californians' rights to marry.
Stu said make it go away.
I made it go away.
While forwarding your own political agenda.
You know, I'm gonna take about five minutes before I fire you.
- Look, I was just...
- This is grounds for termination.
When you're in a foxhole with someone, you need to know the man who's got your back, and right now, I don't know who you are.
I had to deal with that reporter on the fly.
That statement I had for Proposition 8 was in my briefcase.
It was at my disposal. 
I used it.
Do I think you should've released it of your own accord?
Absolutely, but I was not out to undermine you.
If you had trusted me with the actual information,
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.
Okay.
The governor's having an affair.
And it's messy, and there are children involved, and she wanted to meet with me to get my advice.
And I told her she's gotta come clean, but I don't know where this is gonna end.
Kevin, you have my trust, but there are gonna be times when I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything.
Fair enough.
Here.
Wait. 
This isn't Spencer's article.
No, no.
That's an op-ed piece by Henry Myers.
That guy's been pissing on me since the day I got elected.
Now all of a sudden, I'm a hero.
Good job.
[DOOR OPENS]
Thank you, senator.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Seductive? 
Our family is seductive?
No. 
This came right from Holly.
Oh, you don't know that, Nora.
Maybe George decided on his own.
No, no, no, she had it written all over her face.
This woman lives to get at me.
First she pushes me to find George and tell him the truth.
The minute he starts connecting with our family,
- she sends him running for the hills.
- Isn't that what you want?
Poof? 
Remember?
Holly doesn't have anything on you now.
It's all over.
Yeah.
I can't help feeling there's something looming on the horizon.
Oh, it's a bit overdramatic, wouldn't you say?
Even the fortuneteller said that.
Now who's buying into magic?
She said someone would come into our lives that would cause great upheaval.
And she said that I would meet a nice woman and I would settle down.
Oh. 
Whoops.
All right. 
You're right.
What am I worried about?
This is exactly what I wanted, and it's the best thing.
It's the very, very best thing.
It's the best thing.
KITTY: 
Just tell her to hold on one second because I'm here.
I'm right outside. 
I was... 
Oh!
- Trish.
- Kitty, you can't keep showing up.
I know. 
You're on your way to the airport, but I owe you an apology.
I just got scared because you remind me so much of me, and I know how much I want this baby.
And I know that that's me.
That's not you.
But I promise, I promise there will be no more second guessing.
I'm just gonna take the leap.
I'm gonna be like one of your patients.
My life is in your hands.
And not that you can't change your mind, because of course you have every right to.
It's just that I don't want to change it for you.
So I'm just gonna hang back and wait and...
And trust you.
Well, thank you.
But I already called my social worker.
She's sending me a new batch of files.
Oh, no, no, no. 
Please, please.
Wait, wait, wait. 
Don't do that.
Don't do that. 
Robert and I are the same people that you picked.
- And we...
- Kitty, there are plenty of babies out there, and you will be great mom to one of them.
But this shouldn't be so complicated.
Life is complicating enough.
No, you're right. 
You're right. 
I agree.
I agree. 
It shouldn't be so complicated.
You know what?
It won't.
I'm sorry. 
I really have to go.
Good luck.
[STRIKES MATCH]
Wow.
Hey.
Is this always how you make up?
No. 
No.
I've just been thinking.
You know that milestone we approached badly, the one we pretty much just smashed right into?
Yes, I remember.
Yeah.
I was scared.
I've never said that to anyone before.
It always just kind of made things seem so final, and nothing ever felt final to me.
Except this.
I know that I said that I wanted to wait for the right moment, but there is no right moment because it's every moment.
I love you.
- Can I say it back?
- You better.
I love you too.
You gonna kiss me?
Well...
[BOTH LAUGH]

- Justin!
- I'm sorry.
How long have you been standing there?
A few seconds.
I don't know.
I was just listening to you hum in there.
Do you know how creepy that is?
- it's not creepy.
- No,I'm serious.
I-I know I gave you a key,but next time maybe you could knock, ring the doorbell,give me a little warning?
What?
I love you.
Becca,I do.
I...
I love you.
Wow,justin.
Thank you.
I better go get dressed.
Radio interview at 10:00.
More election predictions.
Okay.Then you've got the call about the renewable energy statute.
What's the tracking on that today?
- Up 4.
- Excellent.
Oh,speaking of what's on the ballot,
I prepared a statement against prop 8.
I'm already on the record against that.
I know you've only been here a week, but the senator released his position on the limited marriage act four months ago.
Well,no one remembers four months ago.
People are paying attention now.
- Look,we realize this is your issue¡a - my issue?
The supreme court of california ruled it is illegal to discriminate against gay marriage.
Now forgive me if I'm wrong,robert,I thought you republicans were all about respecting state's rights.
He's got you on that,stu.
sorry to interrupt you,senator.
Your 2:00 got pushed to noon.
- Tell 'em he's busy.
- No,no,I-i have to be at that.
Um,kevin,I agree with stu.
We've already released our statement on prop 8.
We're not coming out again.
- No pun intended.
- Yeah.
Oh,and I'm gonna take the radio interview in the car.
And tell him about the other...
- all right,kitty's brother.
- You can call me kevin.
When you start referring to your boss as "senator," I will.
In the meantime,talk to this reporter from the "sacramento tribune."
He's threatening to publish some cockamamy story about governor kern and the senator involved in some sort of intimate relationship.
What kind of intimate relationship?
The schtupping kind.
The story is he's schtupping her.
Yeah,I know what schtupping is.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't ?
Let me know how it goes.
woW.I just
- I can't believe it is actually happening.I mean, of course,it should've happened ten minutes ago.
- Do you think anything's wrong?
- No,no.
I--I'm sure she's just still in her appointment, and she'll be here as soon as she can.
Well,I hope she's not lost.
I mean,this hospital is like a maze.
You know,robert,I-I think we should've brought her a gift.
I mean,m-maternity clothes are insanely expensive, and she shouldn't have to pay for that all by herself.
This is just her first visit.
She's probably young and might not have a lot money.
We're gonna have plenty of time to,you know,shower her with gifts.
you're right.You're right.
Thank you.I'M... you're right.
- hi.
- Hi.
I'm so sorry.I-I thought that we reserved this room for a private meeting.
- W-we did.Sorry. 
- Oh,well,with me.
I'm trish evans,your birth M.
Oh.
Oh--oh,wow.
yeah.
It's,uh,it's so-- it's so nice to meet you.
Yes.
Yeah,indeed,doctor.
Screw holly.
I'm out of the closet now,remember?
You should've seen her,wielding george lafferty's phone number around as if it was some weapon against my filY.
I know.
You were terrified.
Well,I was.
Bringing william's illegitimate son into the mix was not something I wanted to do, and ha ha,too bad for holly,it's not gonna happen.
What are you making anyway?
Cupcakes for tommy and julia's party tonight.
I'm not saying telling george waeasy.It wasn'T.
He was devastated at first,and then,in the end, he decided he didn't want ryan to know anything about it.
Even if william is ryan's biological father, george raised him.That's all that matters.
Right.Okay. So pick a card.
Are you even listening to me?
George lafferty doesn't want anything to do with our family.
The whole sordid business is over,done,poof.
Right,exactly,poof.
Now come on,pick a card.
All right,remember what it is.
Okay,you got it?
- Yeah.
- Put it back.Don't tell me.
Great.
You're like a child.
You're so excited we're going to magic manor tonight.
The last time I went there,tommy was 10 years old, and I taught him his first trick.
Yes,I'm excited.
He's celebrating his anniversary there tonight.
Are you kidding?
hello.
George.
Oh,no.No,no,no,I w--
I was just thinking about you.
Now?
Really?
Um, okay.Could--could-- could you do it over here?
Okay.
Fine.
S-- ee you in a while.
What?
He's having second thoughts.
He's--he's thinking maybe he should tell ryan the truth.
- There goes poof.
- Oh.
Brothers and Sisters Season 3 Episode 07
Take it from your reaction,you didn't read my application.
- No,but we did.
- No,we did.
- We read it,like,you know...
- a lot.
- A lot.
- A hundred times.
I think that when you said your goal was to become a surgeon, we didn't know that you actually were a surgeon.
Yeah,we thought it was,uh,more of a long-term thing...
And,you know,that you were still a student in missouri.
Well,I'm from missouri,but I'm doing my residency here.
It's a great surprise.
What's your specialty?
- Neuro.
- Wow,a-a brain surgeon.
Not yet.
I'm only in my second year.
Congratulations.
This is gonna be a smart baby.
yeah.
I can only speak for half of the chromosomes.
Oh,so the father wasn't exactly a neurosurgeon himself?
Honey,the father was listed as "unknown."
I know.
We hooked up at a conference.
- Uh,not my finest hour.
- It happens.
And--and I know you guys said,uh,ethnicity doesn't matter.
No.
But he was white,and my mom's korean and my dad's black,so,uh, guess you're in for a surprise.
yeah,so,um,brain surgery.that-
That--that must be a lot of hard work?
Is--is that why you made an adoption plan?
Medicine's my baby.
I don't have the tim or energy for another.
Was--was that decision difficult?
Mm,not really.
I weighed the pros and cons,and for me,adoption made sense.
Right,right.
And how about your family?
Oh,completely supportive.
You won't have any long-lost relatives bugging you.
Oh,we're--we're not at all worried about that.
Yeah,no,I didn't-
- I didn't mean it like that.
oh,it's the E.R.
You guys are great.
I feel really good about this.
- I gotta run.
- No,no,wait,wait.
I-I feel like we--we-- we just got started.
Um,is that it?
I have to travel to houston for a seminar tomorrow.
I could do dinner.
We have the anniversary,but we could cancel.
Oh,no,but this is much more important.
No,that would be great.
Okay,I'll call you guys when whatever train wreck downstairs is over.How's that?
- Okay.
- Fantastic.
- All right,great.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
- She is fantastic.
- Yeah.
- She's perfect.
- Yeah.No,she is.
What,you don't think so?
What?
No.I'm--I-I just,you know,I... she--she did not admit to having any doubt.
Don't you think that's a little weird?
No,I don't think it's weird.
I think it's decisive.
Look,this-- honey,this is all good.
Don't overthink it.
Really.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
It's great.
Okay.All right,I gotta go.
I'll see you later.
- George,can't I get you a cup of tea?
- No,that's okay.
I-I really don't want to take up too much of your time.
Oh,that's okay.
I'm the one who opened pandora's box.
What is it they say,ignorance is bliss?
Yes,ignorance is bliss--total and complete and utter bliss.
George,maybe you were right the first time.
Maybe you should put it all back in the box,lock it up,throw away the key.
Let the past be the past.
That's what I thought I wanted.
Then ryacalled,and the whole conversation,I felt like I was lying to him.
You wanted to protect him.
That was your first instinct.
George,I think you should go with that instit.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think it's me I'm trying to protect.
R-ryan struggled growing up.
He never felt like he fit in.
Is this why?
Would knowing help him make sense of things?
And then I think again how hard he took his mother's death.
And now to tell him his whole identity was based on a lie-- a lie she told him--
I don't think he can handle that.
That's why I called you.
That's why I can't sleep at night.
it's the cupcakes.
And you really look like you could use one.
at this point,I could eat the whole batch.
well,let's just start with one.
yeah.
- Kevin walker?
- Yes.
- Spencer travis from the "sacramento tribune." 
- Thanks for coming by.
Take a seat.
It's good to see that nepotism's alive and well.
Okay,let's set the record straight.Um,
I-I didn't get this job--
I'd rather set the record straight on something else, like tharumor floating around about the governor's affair.
We got a tip,camped out at the hotel gerard.
Did you try the restaurant?
Four stars.I hear it's fantastic.
I've got photographs.
That's governor kern arriving at 11:00 A.M through the back door.
That's 20 minutes later-- senator mccallister-- through the same door.
They both checked in under aliases.
That's irrelevant.
They're both public figures.
That doesn't seem irrelevant to me.
It seems like they didn't want anyone to know they were meeting.
You know,there is an election going on.
I'm sure you could get a bigger story than this.
well,this is a big story.
It's not as big as the libel suit you'd be facing if you run with it.
That's interesting.
So far you've given me irrelevant,and now you've given me libel, but not once have you denied it.
look,I'm denying it.
I'm gonna give you 24 hours to tell me what happened at that meeting, and then I'm running the story.
Fine.
all right,so call I.C.U. And make sure they've got a bed ready.
Excuse me,trish.
I'm--I'm sorry,I'm sorry.
Dr. Evans.
Hi.
I'll meet you in post-op.
Kitty.
What's going on?
Well,I was just wondering if it would be possible for me to ask you a couple of questions before dinner.
Well,I've got about three minutes,so shoot.
Okay,okay.Well,um, this--this might sound silly,but,um,
I've always been under the assumption that our birth mother would be,um... well,you know,some-- some kind of messed up kid.
But--but you,see,you could do this.
I mean,even if you work nonstop,you could hire a nanny.
I don't want a nanny.
I-I just keeping thinking about what you said this morning, how your career is your baby,and
I used to say the same thing,and then I changed my mind.So
I just wanted to make sure that you've, you know,thought this through.
Kitty,I'm a surgeon.
I think everything through.
For now,but what about when you finish your residency?
You know what happens to egg quality.
You know,I really don't need a reproductive health lecture.
Oh,no.I'm--no.
I'm--I'm sorry.I'm sorry.
All I'm saying is that things change.
I mean,what--what's-- what's going to happen when you see the heartbeat or you see the little toes or--
I've seen the toes.
Okay,well,what about when your friends all start having babies, and all they talk about are strollers and--and onesies and--and "baby mozart"?
Okay,stop,stop.
Look,they make us sit down for a reason-- so we can see if this works for both of us.
- Right.
- Obviously,it doesn'T.
No,no,no,no,no.
That--that is not what I'm saying at all.
I just want to be sure that you're sure.
Kitty,I deal with enough neuroses with my patients.
I'm sorry.
Well,w-wait.
What about dinner?
I've been on call for 36 hours.
Let's not waste each other's time.
can we talk?
Talk to stu.
I don't weigh in by the hour.
That reporter has photographs of you and the governor sneaking into hotel gerard.
Kevin...
I spent $40 million last year trying to get my face in front of the american people.
I'd like to think that I can'tsneak in anywhere.
Are you having an affair?
Kitty's my sister.
I think I have a right to ask.
You know,this morng it was the anti-gay marriage initiative,now it's your sister.
This job isn't about your personaissues.
It's about you supporting and protecting my professional agenda.
I can't do that if I don't have the facts.
The facts are,I met with the governor to discuss a sensitive political issue.
Beyond that,it is confidential.
Oh,okay.And the meeting you ran off to this morning?
Is that confidential,too?
That meeting was with our birth mother, who,by the way,happens to be amazing.
But if she picks up the paper tomorrow and reads a slanderous story about me and another government official, she could change her mind.
So if you're really concerned with your sister,not to mention your job, you'll suck it up and you'll figure out a way to fix it!
And you better figure out a way to trust me,or this isn't gonna work out.
If you don't mind... did you guys read the focus group report?
The web applications aren't user-friendly enough.
No way.
A chimp could navigate that program.
But we didn't test it on a chimp.
Listen,people just want to enter a product and find out the greenest way to get it.
What did they think of our carbon footprint graph?
The colors are confusing.
If the asparagus is flown in from argentina,it's red, but if it's trucked in from mexico,it's orange.
Because it's all about mileage-- more mileage,more gas,more damage to the environment.I don't--
I don't understand why that's difficult.
Because people think it is.
Page 26.
Oh,nice,E.
Draw her a rocket ship.
Look,I don't need to see his rocket ship.
whoa.Hey. What's with this magic stuff?
It's for my brother's anniversary party at magic manor.
Listen,guys,could we please focus?
I don't know.
We may have lost him.
You're looking athe magic club president right there.
I don't care if he's david blaine.
And the music?
I married a failed musician.
I'd really prefer not to be working with one.
- This is our process.
- Well,it's not mine,okay?
At my house,no magic tricks,no music, no frickin' rocket ships or crazy robots.
I have two kids,a mortgage.
I don't have time for this.
hello.
All right,I'm panicked.
The parlor magician canceled on the day of the party.
- What's a parlor magician?
- Oh,I know.
It's the cool guy from victorian times who walked around the parlor doing tricks.
So much for the magic of tommy and julia.
What's a magic party without a magician?
It's a disaster,that's what it is.
I think I might have a substitute for you.
You do?
Sarah,how is that even possible?
It's magic.
He'll be there at 6:00.
This is just so crazy.
Ryan has five half siblings.
He doesn't even know who they are.
That's not how life's supposed to go.
You and I,we're the parents,and before you know it,we'll be dead and gone.
- Oh,now that's cheerful.
- You know what I mean.
Your--your siblings are with you for the long haul.
Well,I can't argue with you there.
My brother saul is my best friend,and my kids have always had each other.
They fight,but they've always had each other.
I actually wish I could meet 'em.
It's like I-I need a crystal ball or something.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.
Why don't you come to the party tonight?
You could see for yourself.
Maybe it would help you make a decision.
It would.
But then what if I decide not to pursue it?
Your whole family would know.
Well,no one knows you except kitty,and she's not even gonna be there.
So we just tell 'em I'm some handsome stranger you picked up?
Yeah.
Bob.
Bob?
No,I don't want to be bob.
How about mick jagger?
Well,I don't think they'd believe that.
How about bob jagger?
And we--we met,wait,uh,where did we meet?
A widow's mixer.
first you want to be a rock 'n' roll star,and then you're trolling for widows?
How about dylan jagger?
You are so stuck in the '60s.
come in.
just use your key.
I thought you wanted me to ring the bell.
Seriously?
I didn't mean never use your key.
Well,that's kind of a xed signal,don't you think?
Oh,this is about this morning,isn't it?
Listen,I just-
- I wasn't expecting-- you know what?
Please don't explain.
No,I-I didn't want to say it just because you said it.
- Rebecca¡a - all I'm saying is, you got to find your moment.
I want to find mine.
Can we just drop this?
Let's just go to the party,all right?
Everything's fine.
Great.Exactly what I'm in the mood for-- an anniversary party.Awesome.
Oh,hey.I-I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.
Oh,uh,no.
Um...
- trish canceled dinner.
- Oh.
Did something come up at the hospital?
No,actually,it's,uh,it's much worse than that.She,um... she changed her mind about the adoption.
What are you talking about?
Look,I know how much you loved her,but I had a very weird feeling, so I went to the hospital,I stopped by to see her.
You--you stopped by?
I,uh,I wanted to talk to her.
And the minute I brought up some issues,she-- she pulled out on the spot.
But things were perfect.
They wermore than perfect.
- Look,I know that's what you thought¡a - no,that's what trish said.
And now the whole adoption is off?
What on earth did you say to her?
I just told her that I was a career woman myself, and that I didn't want to have a baby,and now I did.
I just wanted to make sure that she considered what it would feel like to give up a baby at her age.
- You mentioned her age?
- This is not my fault.
She was gonna chan her mind no matter what, or she never would've reacted that way.
I don't get it.
- Do you even want this?
- Of course I want this.
Then how,after everything we've been through, when we finally get chosen by a woman who is smart and talented and more than we ever could've hoped for in a birth mother,
- do you choose to go and confront her on her decision?
- Because we were about to get our hearts broken.
Well,if you're not ready to have your heart broken,you're not ready to be a parent.
- You don't have to walk away.
- Yeah,I do.
- tommy.
- Hey,guys.
Happy anniversary.
Yeah.
Julia went all-out.
I guess she still loves me,huh?
Must be nice.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
- What's-- - don't ask.
- Hi,boys.
- Hey,mom.
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.
- Sweetheart,hi.
- Hi,mom.
Um,boys,I would like you to meet my friend elton.
- Elton?
- Uh,it's a family name.
- A lot of people named elton.
- No,I didn't mean it like-- sorry.
- I'm--I'm tommy.
- Hi.Congratulations.
- I hear it's your anniversary.
- Thank you.
Tommy runs the family business.
He's the one that put the winery in, and he has the most beautiful little daughter--elizabeth-- my granddaughter.
And this is my son justin.
Well,that about sums it up.
Pick a card.
- That's the one you want?
- Yes.
- You're sure?
- yes.
- Positive?
- Positive.
Okay.
Was that your card?
- no way.
- How'd you do that?
That's great.
- Thank you.
- He's great,julia.
I know.
Sarah found him.
- I have no idea how.
- You know,I have my sources.
Okay,miss clara the fortune-teller...
Knew everything about .
She knew my first pet's name started with a "w"--wendell.
It was this miniature bijon my parents used to have-- she knew that I had trouble making decisions, which is not gonna affect us and our business,um...
- Hi,I'm kyle.
- I'm julia.Hi.
Hi,holly.
Holly,nice to meet you.
Uh,sarah's new business partner.
- Yeah,I'm consulting for¡a - consulting?
You're,like,one of the founders.So is he.
We're,uh,we're starting an internet company.
Oh,I-I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician.
Give it a break,holly.
Sarah,so who's your mom new guy?
- Mom has a guy?
- You don't know?
She brought a guy.
Excuse me.
Thank you.So,uh,how do you two know each other?
- it's funny.
- No,it is.
- It's-- it's really a funny story.
- It's very--it's very funny.
- Hey,guys.
- hey.
Isn't this great?
I feel like a kid again.
This is my beautiful daughter sarah.
- Elton.
- Hi.
Oh,elton.
Mom was just gonna tell us how they met.
Oh,god.
I love the "how we met" stories.Go on.
We were at a restaurant a--not together.
We weren't together,were we?
And this man began to choke.
and elton-- he just went over there and gave him the heimlich maneuver,just like that.
Nora called the paramedics.
And then we started talking,and we have just so much in common.
- hilarious.
- Wow,M.
Some guy almost dies,and you go score a date.Good girl.
It's not a date,per se.
Yeah,and don't worry.
He w--he was fine...
Once he spit out the,uh,the-  the fish bone.
- Ham gristle.
- ham gristle?
- Was it a fish bone?
- It was a fish bone.
- Yeah.
oh,it was a fish bone.
I didn't even know what it was.
Okay,so why don't you kids go have some fun?
We're going to go d enjoy the magic and all that.
- Nice meeting you.
- You,too,elton.
What was that?
I guess,uh,mom has a new boyfriend?
Elton?
Really?
ah.
I see it.
Look toward the bottom of the cup.
See how the leaves form the shape of a heart?
Sorta,if I squint.
- What does that mean?
- It means the's a great love in store.
Someone is out there waiting for you.
Yeah,that would be my boyfriend.
He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you."
Actually,the placement indicates the distant future.
It could take years to meet this person.
Years?
What about now?
Um,what are you saying,that justin's love isn't great?
I can only interpret what's here.
You don't even know him.
I mean,you're just reading some--some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup.
It's not stupid,unless your spirit is closed.
My spirit is not closed.
I mean,who said that my spirit is closed?
Your spirit is closed.
Look,I know you think you're in love,but I promise, another few years,a great love will come along... you're not even going to remember this guy.
Oh,that's wonderful,ethan.
great.
Oh,kevin,you're here.
You just missed some fantastic magic.
Not a fan,remember?
I actually need your advice,okay?
You worked for your brother-in-law.
What did you do when dad did things you didn't like?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay,you--you didn't tell mom about holly for one thing.
Well,I didn't tell your mother about holly because I thought I was protecting her.
My job is to protect robert,and I'm not saying he's dad,but he's a-- he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering.
All he says is I-
- I have to trust him.
Do you?
I don't know.
We all know you're the family cynic.
I mean,certainly,that's why you hate magic.
You just are always looking for the angle.
You can't give in to the illusion.
But robert is not an illusion.
That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself-- if he's putting one over on you or if robert is the real thing.
And by the way,kevin,if you can't trust him,don't work for him.
make it here,you know?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you?
Hey,where you been?
I've been looking all over for you.
I love you.
You do?
Yeah.
God,that felt good.
Wow.
Yeah.
- Damn right,that feels good.
- yeah,I know.
I feel like there's weight off my shoulders.
That woman had no idea what she was talking about.
What woman?
Um,nothing.
Just this fortune-teller.
She said that you're not my great love.
Whatever.
Wait,that--that's why you said it,because some fortuneeller told youe were doomed?
So this is your moment?
Rebecca,this seems like a lame protest to me.
Justin,why are you making such a big deal out of this?
Well,I'm--I'm sorry.Where I come from, saying I love you actually comes from the people saying it.
Okay,well,sorry.I-I can't seem to say anything right.
Why don't you just write me a script next time?
You know what?
I'm gonna give you these back,rebecca.
And when you figure it out,you let me know,all right?
So...
elton?
Yes,elton.Why are you guys so hung up on his name?
Have you guys done the dance with no pants?
- Sarah.
- What?
Come on.
One of us should be having sex,and sadly,it's not me.
Well,it's not me,either.
Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together.
I mean,you brought two men with you.
I'm not accusing you of having a menage trois.
Mom!
Well,you're the one who brought up sex.
Well,I regret it, almost as much as I regret bringing ethan and kyle.
Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together.
Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
I don't know,mom.
Maybe she's right.
I mean,really,a start-up in this financial climate?
Bear stearns can't even keep afloat, and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship.
- Oh,no.
- You think I made a mistake.
- Oh,my god.
- Oh,god.It's bad.
I really screwed up.
Oh,hi.
Kitty,what are you doing here?
I-I thought you were meeting with your birth mother.
Yeah.
Well,I--it-- uh,it's a long story.
Well,good.
Tell sarah about it.
what the hell is up with mom?
I don't know.
She's been acting weird all night.
She brought this guy-- elton.
- Elton?
- Exactly.
Dude,what's with the briefcase?
Robert won't give you the night off?
Kevin has a new job.
Yeah,he's a lawyer turned republican.
I'm still a democrat,dumb-ass.
Why don't you be nice,justin?
You' embarrass your mother's date.
- Oh,it's not really a da.
- Elton,there you are.
You know,it's such a lovely evening out.
Why don't we take a walk?
That sounds like a date to me.
I was really enjoying talking to your family.
Oh!
Kitty.
George?
What-- what are you doing here?
This is elton.
That's mom's date.
Don't be rude.
Do you want a drink?
Oh.
You're-- you're dating ryan's dad?
- No,she's dating elton richards.
- I'm not dating him.
What?
I'm--I'm sorry.
Excuse me.No,no,no.
- This is,uh,george lafferty.
- what?
Ryan's george lafferty?
- mom.
- Mom,I knew you were hiding something.
Mom!
All right,fine.
George,this is my family.
Family,this is...
george lafferty.
Hi.
Oh,my god.
unbelievable.
Since when are you friends with george lafferty?
- He kicked us out of his house.
- You went to his house?
- Look,this is really all my fault.
- No,it is not.
I invited you here to meet ryan's half siblings.
I'm soy we deceived u,but george needs to figure this out.
I thought meeting you might help.
So what is this,like,a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff,mom?
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
- Oh,hey,julia.
- Yes,fine.
- It's a lovely party.
- I thought I heard yelling.
oh,in our family?
No.
We're just all catching up with george.
You mean elton.
How about some cupcakes?
can you believe our mom?
Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore.
W-why are you so out of breath?
- I've been looking for you.
- Well,where's scotty?
He couldn't get any time off work.
Where's--where's robert?
Robert's at home being furious.
Really?
How furious?
I went to see our birth mother.
Oh,of course.
Oh,good.Good,good,good.
Oh,no.
No,no.No,kevin.
Not good.
Bad.
Very bad.
N-- she changed her mind about the adoption.
She's not gonna go through with it,not with us anyway.
Well,did she hear something about robert?
No.
No,she--she loved robert.
It was--it was me.
I showed up with all of these questions because I wanted proof that she wasn't gonna change her mind.
Well,what's wrong with wanting proof?
Well,what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me,obviously.
And she shoun't have to.
But it h--it has nothing to do with robert?
Oh,would you please stop trying to make this about robert?
- This is about me.
- Right.
Kevin,I'm serious.
I think I made a very big mistake.I-I...
I couldn't trust her,and... and now we don't have a baby.
So fix it.
looks like someone is on the horizon... someone who will bring great upheaval into your life.
No,no,no.I thought so,too.
But that's wrong.
- No,this reading's pretty clear.
- Well,the reading is wrong.
George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation.
I can identify with that.
Well,the way these cards are spread,this person represents a threat.
Maybe it's talking about his son ryan.
And I'm telling you right now,I am done being scared.
Siblings should meet each other.
I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him, and I'm actually happy about that.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
That's great.
What else do they say?
Ladies and gentlemen,I know many of you don't believe in magic.
Instead,you search for an explanation.
There must be something I'm not telling you,something I'm hiding.
You're right.
Most of the time,magic is about sleight of hand,the principle of misdirection.
I make you look one way... so you forget to look the other.
hi.
Have you seen a young woman,light brown hair,tall?
I seem to have lost my daughter.
No,but I'll--I'll keep an eye out.
- Uh...okay.
- What--what's her ne?
Rebecc thanks.
Uh,wait,are...are you,uh,are you holly?
Yeah.
I'm,uh,I'm george lafferty.
Oh,my god.
You're ryan's dad.
I guess you've heard about me,too.
I hope you don't mind,but nora told me about what happened with your daughter.
No,I don't mind.
It's just thatuh,she might not be the most reliable narrator.
Well,it's probably pretty complicated between you two.
No,actually,it's quite simple.
But I do know what it's like to be in your position, so if there's ever anything that I can do... uh,holly.
I do have a few questions.
Sure.
watch closely,because with julia's help, you're about to see something so amazing,so improbable, it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle.
Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity.
In the 1800s,european audiences saw,for the first time,people rise unassisted... so...you called me down here.
What do you got?
There's an exit out that way.
just maybe it's magic.
With one snap of my fingers,the lovely julia will fall into a deep,deep sleep.
- nora.
- Oh,george.Sorry.
I-I got sucked into watching the show.
It's okay.
I-I have to go.
Go?
What do you mean?
You know,your family's lovely and very seductive-- seductive?
All right,which one of 'em hit on you?
It's--it's not like that.
I was right the first time.
This was a mistake.
It--it won't be good for ryan orny of us.
I--I'd rather leave it alone.
I don't understand.
Our families are what they are.
Let's not destroy anything.
Good-bye,nora.
- Hi.
- Hey.
How was the party?
Oh,god.
Never a-- never a dull moment.
I'll tell you all about that later.
Robert...
I am really,really sorry.
I never should've gone to trish without telling you.
I don't know why,but I just l my anxiety get the best of me.
And I-I-I knew how you felt about her, and I didn't want you to think that I was crazy and--
I-I love you when you're crazy.
But what I don't love is when you go off, you know,without me and don't tell me about it.You know, we're gonna be parents,so we need to be...
- trusting each other.
- I do trust you.
It's just-- it's everybody else in the world that I don't trust.
And I just didn't know if I could do it again.
I mean,we've already lost a baby,and I-- oh,is that what this is all about?
Oh,it's--it's everything,you know?
It's--it's all the fertility treatments that didn't work and all the pregnancy tests that came back negative.
And I just-
- I have had my heart broken... many times.
But I am ready to be a parent.
- I know.
- And I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna make this right with trish.
I prise.I'M...
I'm gonna fix it.
- there she is.
- Good morning.
- Coffee.
- Thank you.
- What time is it?
- It's on time.
You laid down the law,remember?
Have you guys been to bed?
Are you kidding?
I worked a night at the magic manor.
That's like playing carnegie hall.
Check this out?
See that?
New web application-- simplified,streamlined,sexy.
And a new carbon footprint graph.
You did this last night?
We may act like we're stupid.
We're not.
You don't act stupid.
You act 20.
- We're older than that.
- I know.Sorry.
Listen,working with you guys,it's a little bit of an adjustment.
I have a lot at stake.
Yeah?
Well,so do we.
You know,you shouldee our credit card bills.
We're not gonna fail.
Miss clara last night told me we're gonna make boatloads of money.
you just gotta trust the process.
Maybe you're right.
Ethan,draw me a rocket ship.
Yes,ma'am.
you seen the paper today?
No,I-I was just-- "senator robert mccallister had a private meeting "
with fellow republican governor eve kern
"urging her to release a strong statement "
against the limited marriage act in time for the general election."
Any word of an affair?
Nope,just a follow-up from the governor refirming all californians' rights to marry.
Stu said make it go away.
I... made it go away.
While forwarding your own political agenda.
You know,I'm gonna take about five minutes before I fire you.
Look,I was just-- this is grounds for immediate termination.
Kevin,when you're in a foxhole with someone, you need to know the man who's got your back, and right now,I don't know who you are.
I had to deal with that reporter on the fly.
That statement I had for proposition 8 was in my briefcase.
It was at my disposal.
I used it.
Do I still think you should've released it of your own accord?
Absolutely.
But I was not out to undermine you.
If you had trusted me with the actual information,
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.
Okay.
The governor's having an affair.
And it's messy,and there are children involved, and she wanted to meet with me to get my advice.
And I told her she's gotta come clean,but I don't know where this is gonna end.
Kevin,you have my trust, but there are gonna be times when I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything.
Fair enough.
Here.
Wait.
This isn't spencer's article.
No,no.
That's an op-ed piece by henry myers.
That guy's been pissing on me since the day I got elected.
Now all of a sudden,I'm a hero.
Good job.
Thank you,senator.
Seductive?
Our family is seductive?
No.
This came right from holly.
Oh,you don't know that,nora.
Maybe george decided on his own.
No,no,no,she had it written all over her face.
This woman lives to get at me.
First she pushes me to find george and tell him the truth.
And then the minute he starts connecting with our family, she sends him running for the hills.
Well,isn't that what you wanted?
Poof,remember?
Holly doesn't have anything on you now.
It's all over.
Yeah.
I can't help feeling there's something looming on the horizon.
Oh,it's a bit overdramatic,wouldn't you say?
Even the fortune-teller said that.
Now who's buying into magic?
She said someone would come into our lives that would cause great upheaval.
And she said that I would meet a nice woman and I would settle down.
All right.
You're right.
What am I worried about?
This is exactly what I wanted,and it's the best thing.
It's the very,very best thing.
It's the best thing.
Just tell her to hold on one second 'cause I'm here.
I'm right outside.
I was--oh!
Trish.
Kitty,you can't keep showing up.
I know.You're on your way to the airport,but I-I owe you an apology.
I...
I just got scared because you remind me so much of me, and I know how much I nt this baby.
And I know that that's--that's me.
That--that's not you.
But I...
I promise.
I promise.
There--there will be no more second guessing.
I'm--I'm just gonna take the leap.
I--I'm gonna be like one of your patients.
My life is in your hands.
And not that you can't change your mind,because of course you have every right to.
It's just that I don't wt to change it for you.
So I'm just gonna-
- I'm gonna hang back and--and wait,and,uh... and trust you.
Well...
thank you.
But I already called my social worker.
She's sending me a new batch of files.
Oh,no,no,no.
Please,please.
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.Robert and I are the same people that you picked.
And--and we-- kitty,there are plenty of babies out there,and you will be great mom to one of them.
But this shouldn't be so complicated.
- Life is complicated enough.
- No,you're right.
You're right.
I-I-I agree.I agree.
It shouldn't be so complicated.
You know what?
It won'T.
I'm sorry.
I-I really have to go.
Good luck.
Justin
Come in
wow.
Hi.
Is this,uh,always how you make up?
No.
No.Um...
I've just been thinking.
You know that milestone we approached badly, the one we pretty much just smashed right into?
Yes,I,uh,I remember.
Yeah.
Um...
I was scared.
I've never said that to anyone before.
It always just kind of made things seem so final, and nothing ever felt final to me... except this.
I know that I said that I wanted to wait for the right moment, but there is no... right moment, because it's every moment.
I love you.
can I say it back?
You better.
I love you,too.
Yogonna kiss me?
Well...
Brothers and Sisters Season 3 Episode 07

Anyway, this is... this is me.
- Thanks for walking me home.
- It's my pleasure.
You wouldn't want to come up for some coffee, would you?
A little late for coffee.
Yeah.
I'd love a beer.
Ok.
Yeah, I know. 
It's a little weird,
Isn't it?
No, no. 
It, it shows your passion for your work.
Actually, all of this is for my roommate.
It just... 
I don't know, it makes him feel so at home.
- Where's home?
- Borneo.
You're gonna love him.
You're gonna love him. 
Chango!
Chango.
You want to give him a peanut?
- I don't.
- Here you go.
Come on.
Just...
- hey, he took it!
- Yeah!
- He really likes you.
- We have a lot in common.
We're both evolving, we both have a little bit of a back hair issue.
Both have the Same taste in women.
Yes, question?
- Can I show you something?
- Sure.
Sure.
Show away.
I shot this during my last rescue.
See, in...
in the world of primates, the female always... initiates.
This was bad idea, wasn't it?
No, no, no, no. 
That's just a very powerful image, very intense.
Yeah.
- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I mean, their mating rituals are so raw and so beautiful.
I'll give you the raw.
Would you like to do that?
I'm sorry... do what?
That.
With me.
You...
want that?
Yeah.
I could maybe give you half that.
Come on, Gator.
Take me like a silverback.
Come on.
This is new.
Season 1 
- Episode 1 "Pilot"
- Synchro By : ¤AkaZab¤
Luckily there was no penetration, but it appears you have a 2-Inch laceration on your upper-left gluteus and abrasions around your sphincter, and...
English.
Basically, Gator, your ass was pummeled, ok?
But don't worry.
I think all you need is 3 stitches, and definitely a shave, for sure.
What the hell is going on here?
Gator had a little run in with a bi-Curious George.
- Got attacked by a Monk. 
Ey!
- Sorry.
That clears things up.
Look, I'm on my way to the office.
Is there the slightest chance
That you've signed your divorce papers?
He's still wearing his ring.
What do you think?
How many times do I have to tell you guys? 
I can't get the damn thing off.
- you try.
- Do not pull that finger.
Gator, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the other side.
Look, I just. 
I want to go over the papers a couple more times, ok?
Why? 
Is there something you forgot to give her?
My bad.
- Hi, kid.
- Hey, Freddy.
- Nope. 
Nursing a cold.
- Ok, lots of vitamins, tons of rest.
We got a limo picking us up, taking us to a party at the charles hotel for my company's merger.
Open bar, featuring Tommy's new brew.
That's right. 
Trawler stout, inspired by my third wife.
Dark, rich, and a little nutty.
Sorry, you guys, I can't. 
I have a date.
- Who's the new guy?
- Actually, I met him at the gym.
He's funny, he's smart, he works for the Celtics.
He's got great posture.
Really clean fingernails.
He's, honorable.
- What's a matter with this guy?
- He's short. 
He's really short.
He can't help that.
I know, but I've just never dated a guy shorter than me before.
I mean, chad was 6'6", and I kind of like...
You know what? 
Not to be insensitive and please don't take this the wrong way, but chad was a douche.
- The biggest douche.
- Captain douche.
Guy played you for 7 years, never pulled the trigger.
All we're saying, kate, is don't compare everybody to the Chad.
- Open your mind.
- I know.
I know, you're right. 
Tim is great, and I'm going to give it a shot.
Yeah, and you never know, you might be surprised, sometimes big things come in little packages.
Nope. 
I've seen him in spandex.
Trust me, there's no surprises.
I'm gonna take off, guys.
Gator, sign those papers.
Freddy, burn those gloves. 
Tommy, I've got nothing for you.
Well, all stitched up.
Keep those bandages clean.
Thanks, Doc. 
Hey, we'll pick you up at 7:00, all right?
Actually, I think tonight I'm going to pass on the festivities.
- What?
!
- What are you talkin' about?
Well, I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but, you know, tonight is my birthday.
Hey, I totally forgot. 
Happy birthday!
Hey, yeah, happy birthday. 
Now, you've gotta come out with us, man.
Well, no, it's just, you know, guys, for the last 9 years,
Lareep and I, we would always go to thank goodness it is fridays for my birthday and, you know,
I think this is what i want to do, you know?
Hey, Freddy, Lareep left you 6 1/2 months ago.
Not spending your birthday by yourself.
- Come on, man, it'll be a blast.
- Look, guys,
I will be fine, ok?
What, you don't think I can get a date?
No.
Trust me.
Ok, at work, nurses are constantly beating me off with a stick.
I'll bet.
I really can't tell you how excited I am that beacon street financial is merging with algonquin investments.
But we'll make a lot of money come monday. 
Tonight, let's just make friends.
Thank you very much. 
Have fun tonight.
- Thank you.
- Nice job, Jack.
It was all I could do not to give you a standing ovation.
Katherine, meet Jack.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you Mr. Gately.
- The pleasure's mine.
- Katherine's my VP of operations.
She's been the brains behind my company for 15 years.
Ah, that's Baloney.
He's the brains. 
I just do the legwork.
I see. 
You're the wheeler, you're the dealer?
You rock, you roll.
It's a little early in our relationship to be starting up with the gimp jokes, isn't it?
Anyway, I want you to meet my daughter.
She's right over there.
She is beautiful.
Thanks.
Can't believe she's already a sophomore.
She going to boston college like her old man?
Yeah, right.
I'm just trying to get her through the next 3 years of high school.
Would you excuse me?
Be right back.
Bottoms up.
Hi, excuse me. 
Don't you look lovely tonight. 
Can I borrow you for a second?
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Hey, man...
What are you doin'?
Me and the lady are totally connecting.
Man, we're like on the same wavelength or something.
You know why?
'Cause she's 16!
Now sign her yearbook and start talking to the adults.
I'm just, you know, I'm a little out of practice, you know.
This is my first date since... '92.
December '92, so, you know, almost '93.
Don't apologize, Freddy.
It's not every day I get to have dinner with a doctor.
There's nothing more attractive then a man who's so passionate about what he does.
But I'm sure you're just as passionate about being a who... who...
Pros... prosti...
- An escort?
- An escort, yes...
It's ok. 
You can say it.
I'm not ashamed.
No. 
I'd never suggested you should be.
It's just, you know...
Look, I know how hard it is out there.
I mean, as pathetic as it sounds,
I just try and look at this as getting paid to try and find Mr. Right.
Wow, that's... very healthy perspective on the whole thing.
I mean... happy, happy birthday we have something for you happy, happy birthday we have something for you
Did you do this?
I did it! 
You did this!
- Happy birthday! 
Make a wish.
- Thank you.
Let's make this the best birthday you have ever had.
Sign me up.
Oh, you know what? 
I know of this incredible cheesecake place.
They have the most amazing mango chutney cheesecake.
- It is like... it melts in your mouth.
- Good.
Cheesecake is so good, it's true. 
Or...
- hear me out...
- Ok.
Atlantic City.
Atlantic City!
You mean, like, New Jersey Atlantic City?
I mean, don't get me wrong, i love the idea, it's just, you know, by the time we leave to go there now.
I know a company that could have us there in less than an hour.
Like a private plane?
Freddy, it'll be so much fun!
The casinos, they're right on the beach.
It's so romantic!
- But, still, I don't know.
- Ok. 
You know what? 
Oh, it's fine.
- You're disappointed.
- No, no. 
It's a silly idea.
- It's not a silly idea. 
It is.
No. 
We can do your thing.
- But I don't want to do...
- The, the cheesecake thing.
- Yeah, we'll have fun.
- It's a good...
Do you know what?
It's my birthday.
I'll fly if I want to.
- Let's do it!
- I don't even care right now!
Oh, my god!
Hey, this isn't so bad, now, is it?
I've never been this close before!
- It's pretty good?
- Yeah, it's amazing.
Come here.
Oh, my god! 
These seats are incredible!
One of the many perks.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, playa!
Ryan, my man!
- Hey, good luck tonight, guys.
- Say, good luck with you.
Yeah, well, I just might need it!
Hey, it's almost tip-off time.
I gotta go take care of some business.
Don't go anywhere, all right?
I'll be back in a snap.
Gator.
Hey, look, you were so right.
No, no, I just want to thank you for encouraging me to open my mind.
Yeah, tim is so...
- Lucky the Leprechaun!
- Oh, my god, I gotta go.
Hey Jack. 
Do me a favor and make sure Katherine gets home safely?
Sure, herb.
Thanks.
Come on, let's go.
Thanks.
Thanks. 
Nice to meet you.
Charming.
Hey... 
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there, Katherine.
Call me Kitty.
Olive.
You all right?
I'm miserable.
You know, all I want is some companionship, some conversation, maybe a stiff cock... tail once in a while.
Is that so much to ask?
No.
No, no, no.
You know what?
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back. 
Somebody I want you to meet. 
Stay there, ok?
That's right, run!
- Then I was confused by what I wanted.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
Hey, she is 29.
It was my first question out of the gate.
I have an emergency.
Where is she? 
Ok.
See that beauty over there?
Name's Kitty.
Had a little bit too much to drink.
She...
And apparently she's flammable.
I need to ask you a huge favor.
She's all wound up.
I can't handle her right now.
- Will you take her home for me?
- Why can't you take her home?
Because have to work with these people.
I don't want this any more awkward than it already is.
I don't know, man.
I've got a real sweet tooth for this Jennifer Spanishton sitting over here by the chocolate volcano.
Hey, please do this for me.
Please do this!
You can take the limo.
I'll cab it.
Ok. 
I'll do it.
Only because it's you.
Ok. 
Thank you.
Hey, be discreet.
Don't worry.
When have I ever not been discreet?
Now!
Live in the now.
Live in the now.
Gotta live... good party, isn't it?
Llllllucky the Leprechaunnnn!
Yeah!
That one's for you.
Are you ok?
We'll take 2.
We're gonna take 2 of these.
Do you believe in fairy tales?
I do now.
What about ufos?
Do you believe in those?
I haven't really thought about it.
Do you believe in low carbohydrate diets?
No.
I like pasta.
I do, too.
Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
I was just checking the scores.
Why didn't you check them at your own place?
'Cause I just tucked Kitty into your bed.
But...
Why'd you bring her here?
What do you mean? 
You told me to bring her home for you.
Her home, not my home!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
You said, and I quote, "please take her home for me, and be discreet."
- Which is exactly what I've done.
- Please tell me you're joking.
Ok, I'm joking.
God...
But I'm not.
She's in your bed.
But I totally teed her up for you, man.
I sprayed some air freshener in there, lit some candles.
I told her how hot you thought she was, and then if she slept with you, it wouldn't be the worst thing for her career.
Are you kidding?
That's sexual harassment.
- Even on the weekend?
- Are you kidding?
Anyway, it's fine. 
I calmed her down.
She was mad? 
For like a second.
But I told her that you're normally not this pushy, but that, you know, you're a little desperate because of the divorce.
Gator!
- I gotta go.
- No, Tommy!
No, you have to take her home!
By the way, I put your hamper by the bed in case she throws up again.
Gator, come to bed!
- Oh my god!
- You're in luck.
This morning, kitty waxed her whiskers.
Annie, Annie.
Listen to me.
Annie, look, last night may just have been like the best night
- of my entire life.
- Mine, too!
No, but, listen, I want to have last night every night with you.
I know this seems crazy, and it is crazy you know, but my friends, you know they always tell me that I need to take more chances, and I never do.
So without further undo,
Annie Lewis Bappy,
Would you...
What's wrong with this picture?
She should be on her knees!
Sir, I'm kind of in the middle of something...
Hey, hey, Atlantic City, Taj Mahal. 
You're my kind of guy.
Chuck, we had the best time!
Hi, Pookie.
Chuck? 
Who's this Chuck?
Annie's full-time manager, Part-time boyfriend.
You said boyfriend?
What do you say we just go ahead and settle up here, birthday boy?
No, no, I already settled up.
I paid in advance.
For dinner, so all you're responsible for is the additional balance.
Additional balance? 
What does he mean, additional balance?
Here's the breakdown. 
You had her for 10 hours at the regular rate, the last 4 at time and a half, plus, you took her across state lines, which may or not be a violation of the mann act.
- This wasn't in the website...
- That's an additional surcharge.
And then, of course, uncle Sammy's gotta get his.
Yes, I agree with that.
- Tell you what I'm going to do.
- Ok.
- You know, you look like good people.
- I try.
I think, I'm gonna round it down to an even 8 grand.
It, $8,000?
Yeah.
Nikki, hi.
Is this an ok time?
Yeah.
Yeah, come on in.
I'm sorry I haven't signed the papers.
I'll get to it this week.
Actually, I'm glad you haven't signed them.
Really?
Yeah, look, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and I know I really messed up.
Look, it's over.
It's been over for a while.
And what about guy?
Guy.
He's back at Cirque du Soleil.
I don't know. 
I was just hoping there's maybe some chance that we could...
It's Dr. Freddy.
I got raped by a monkey the other day.
I should probably take this.
Freddy, can I call you...
What?
Hooker?
What... what...
Chuck? 
Who's Chuck?
Freddy, slow down. 
Slow... all right, take it easy. 
I'll be right there, ok?
Look, Nikki, I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- You've given me a lot to think about.
- Well, what's to think about?
I already told you, guy's gone, he left.
Guy left.
Well...
Thank you.
- Look, I'm a doctor. 
I'm...
- Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, calm down.
Calm down, ok? 
It's gonna be ok.
All right, 8 grand.
Come on, I got systems.
Cash only.
Come on, man!
What kind of business are you running?
He said that she didn't in about.
- Hey!
I tried, all right?
37-year-old virgin here wanted to wait.
- I thought she was different.
- She is different. 
She's a hooker.
Where am I supposed to get 8 grand cash on a sunday, Mr. I got systems?
Hold on, wait, wait.
What?
- Freddy, you didn't.
- I paid 11,000 for it. 
Take it.
11,000?
Be lucky to get 7 gs out of this.
What else you got?
You don't have to do that, Gator.
All right, it's a deal.
I'll pawn 'em both.
You're gonna pawn 'em?
What about us?
Baby...
You're right. 
You've been my top bitch for 12 years.
What do you say we tie the kink in the old cow's tail?
Yes, yes, yes!
All good under the hood.
No sign of effection.
- You really sign it?
- Yeah.
I had an unexpected vistor this morning.
I begin to see things a little more clearly.
What visitor?
What a lovely day!
Mr.Gately, I... 
look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning at the office, at which time I would supply you a new hamper and... a toilet brush.
Al go a frich you mec.
You are the first male in the baring last night.

Previously on Psych...
I needed to talk to you.
Just say it, say what it is.
I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life.
Your mother's not a part of it anymore.
Look. 
I don't care what you do, okay? 
I don't care.
Mom?
Dispatch, we've located the stolen vehicle.
Occupants inside.
Approaching now.
10-4, proceed with caution.
Henry, you don't wanna do this.
I don't have a choice, Ray.
Think of the consequences.
I'm way past consequences.
This needs to end tonight.
Whoops.
Whoops?
It's my neighbor's car.
We were gonna put it back.
It was just a dare.
Is there a problem here, Officer?
You wanted my attention, Shawn, you got it, buddy.
Wait. 
You guys know each other?
Yeah. 
He's sort of my dad.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for that "World's Greatest Dad" mug back.
You just keep talking, Shawn.
You keep talking.
Oh, don't worry, I will. 
Like when I read you your rights.
Oh, I have rights?
That'll be new and fun.
What am I gonna tell your mother?
I don't know, you think you can get a hold of her new phone number?
I hope it was worth it, smart-ass.
This officially ends your chance of being a cop.
Let's be honest, I gave up wanting to be like you a long time ago.
That's it! 
Somebody book him.
You, beanpole! 
Get over here.
Fingerprint him, now.
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. 
Me?
Never mind, rookie, I'll do it myself.
Burton Guster.
Dude. 
I'm freaking out.
You have to help me.
What's wrong?
My mom is here.
She's back in the country?
Back in the country?
Try, try back in the city.
Try downstairs in my dad's kitchen.
Where are you? 
Hiding out in my bedroom.
Oh, my God! 
Holy crap. 
I just found an entire unopened box of Shrinky Dinks.
You're hiding in your bedroom because your mom came to visit?
Dude, you've got problems.
Are you hearing what I'm saying?
My mom is standing downstairs, in my dad's kitchen, laughing it up, having a grand old time. 
You don't think that's a little weird?
And you're unhappy she's here?
No, I'm not unhappy she's here...
I don't know. 
I haven't seen her in three years.
She used to tell me everything.
What's she doing here?
Working.
For the police department?
I guess, I don't know.
I haven't found out much because, apparently, it's 1988 in my house and no one felt the need to tell me anything.
I know my dad is behind all of this...
Oh, my God!
Furby!
Dude, did you know I had a Furby?
Shawn, I have no time for this. 
I've got my own problems.
I have to go see Frankjim Ogletree.
Frankjim Ogletree? 
Is that a person or a hippopotamus?
He's the new Regional Sales Manager.
My immediate boss.
And a tyrant.
They call him the little Pinochet.
That's too abstract.
Why don't they just call him "jerk pants"? 
Or "Suck McJones"?
They're MIT guys, Shawn.
Now, go face your parents.
You've been wanting to see your mom for ever.
And tell her I'm coming by for some Jell-O cake.
Holy... 
Dude! 
I just found a pristine issue of Dynamite magazine with Square Pegs on the cover.
Hold on, I'm gonna read "Bummers" to you.
The cheese knife is in the same place, right?
Yeah, it's right there. 
You want me to give you a hand, hon?
Did you just call me "honey"?
I did not. 
I was going to say "hunchback. "
Oh, Shawnie, look at this.
Not only does your father own a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux, he hand-made little cucumber sandwiches. 
Do you believe that?
Wow, he is just chock full of surprises today.
Well, I'm allowed to expand my horizons, right?
I am so glad to see you, Mom.
What are you doing in town?
Well, some police departments occasionally call me up to come back and do psych evaluations.
How long have you known about this?
Not long.
I almost didn't do it.
I changed my mind at the last second.
I'm doing Santa Barbara PD, a few in San Diego, the Bay area.
When are our dinner reservations, Henry?
Oh, there's dinner plans tonight?
You can make it, right?
Of course he can make it.
Of course I will come, I just...
Need to cancel a date but that is not a big deal.
You made other plans?
I didn't make other plans.
I didn't know.
Didn't know what?
That you were coming.
Henry, why didn't you tell him I was coming?
He doesn't have a phone.
You don't have a phone? 
What... 
I do.
Are you having money problems?
Henry, why don't you buy him a phone?
Mom, I'm fine. 
I'm not having money problems.
I dropped my phone while I was solving a very important crime.
I was on the front page of the newspaper yesterday.
Yeah.
May I speak with you privately?
What the hell is going on in there?
I tried to tell you, Shawn.
Allow me to demonstrate trying.
"Shawn, guess who's coming back into the country on Friday?
"Your mother. " That's it.
Mission accomplished.
All right! 
Look, I wanted to clear the air on a few things before she got here.
Clear the air? 
You think you can undo 15 years of hard feelings with a bottle of... 
Pinot... 
Bordeaux.
I didn't even know Walmart had a wine cellar.
Look, would give me a break? 
I'm just trying to make a nice night here for her here.
You're sabotaging me.
Why would I do that?
I don't know, but I'm gonna figure it out.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Ogletree?
Shut the door, Burton.
I was reading the paper yesterday and something caught my attention.
Have to say I was surprised, considering you seem to already have a full-time job.
This is just something I do on the side.
A hobby, really. 
Like collecting thimbles or raising carrier pigeons.
You raise carrier pigeons?
No. 
Not at all.
That's totally lame.
I just said that because I was flustered.
I raise carrier pigeons.
I'm glad you said that, because I was afraid to tell you how cool I thought carrier pigeons are.
Flying around and carrying stuff. 
Coming back.
Awesome, I hear that.
Are you familiar with the exclusivity clause in your contract?
It means we don't allow second jobs.
Jobs?
No, no. 
Psych is more like community service.
And it never affects my work.
This photo was taken Thursday night,
I noticed you signed out early that day.
I think the important thing is I signed out.
Let's roll back the clock, shall we?
Monday, the 28th, you had three appointments.
You missed all of them.
Tuesday, the 29th, you disappeared after lunch.
And Wednesday, well, here you are.
You did your entire week's work in one afternoon.
It was a crazy week.
It seems to me you had a crazy year.
I have taken the liberty of preparing this for you.
What is this?
It's a termination notice.
Or, you could quit your other job. 
You tell me.
Good choice.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth
I know, you know They just don't have any proof
Embrace the deception Learn how to bend
Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end
Shawn, you don't have to walk me through the whole building.
I used to do quite a few sessions here.
This is where I met your father.
I know.
I heard the story.
You did his evaluation after he shot some drug dealer.
He told you that?
He twisted his ankle doing security for the Cinnamon Festival.
I had to clear him for duty.
Figures, that's about par.
What happened?
He said the two of you are getting along better.
Mom, the last thing I wanna do right now is talk about Henry.
Okay, that's fair.
Let's talk about you.
Who was that date you had to cancel on Friday?
Ah, it was just some girl I met. 
She was a museum curator.
It's not a big deal, Mom. 
I doubt it would've worked out anyway.
How many dates?
That would've been the first.
Shawn.
Mom.
Come on, Goose, whenever we talk, you're always about to not go on a second date with somebody new.
I happen to be excellent at first dates.
You know who is having multiple dates?
Dad. 
I believe he's up to number eight with his Jekyll and Hyde English girlfriend.
You guys should connect more often.
He told me they broke it off a few weeks ago.
We're talking about him again.
Yes, we are. 
Let's stop.
I should let you go.
How many of these do you have to do, anyway?
Oh, three uniforms and a detective.
Oh. 
You wanted to see me, Chief?
Yes. 
It has come to my attention, Detective, that you've discharged your weapons in the last four cases you've worked.
Thank you.
That wasn't a compliment.
I'm just trying to keep the streets safe, Chief.
The last incident was at a cat show.
Well, let me just go on record as saying that I would never shoot a cat.
I guess I could find some solace in that.
Unless it was approaching in a threatening manner or refused to stop upon my command.
I would probably just fire a warning shot to make my point but it's really a field decision. 
I can't commit to it at this juncture.
I've requested a department-sanctioned psychologist to come here and have a session or two with you.
I'm just gonna have to say no.
That wasn't a question.
Could you phrase it like one?
Hey, Katie. 
Kathy. 
Shawn.
Shawn?
What the hell are you doing here?
I should ask you the same question.
I work here.
Okay. 
I should ask you a different question.
Why didn't you return my calls all weekend?
Shawn, I had no other choice about all this.
Oh, my God. 
This isn't a joke!
You're really quitting Psych?
I'm so sorry, Shawn.
In a text message, no less?
I couldn't think of any other way to tell you.
I knew you would just try to convince me to stay.
Listen, maybe we can still do it on the weekends.
If you're ready to hear some good news,
I have worked out a compromise that will solve all of this.
Really? 
Yes. 
You quit this job. 
This job, you quit!
We take on extra cases to make up the difference in salary.
I make 48 grand a year, Shawn.
What is that? 
Yen?
Who needs $48,000 to live?
I need 32. 
The other 16 generally goes to you.
Don't be ridiculous. 
I claimed you on my taxes, Shawn.
Holy crap, is this Bianca's pappardelle?
Mmm-hmm, I found it in the kitchen fridge.
Oh, my God, she's going to go insane.
She hand-rolls the pasta every weekend, Shawn.
They take all day. 
She grinds her own spices, Shawn!
Well, I thought it was for everybody.
Crap.
Burton?
Bianca.
Paul would like to see you.
Mr. Haversham? 
Really? 
Lovely.
I'll be there in a second.
What does she do?
She's Haversham's secretary.
Is Haversham the guy who tried to fire you?
No. 
He's that guy's boss.
Everybody's boss. 
He's the VP.
Perfect. 
He's the one we have to convince to let you keep doing both jobs.
But...
I need a second.
I gotta clean my teeth before we go in.
No. 
No, no, Shawn.
You're leaving now.
Gus, I'm not budging until we make this nice.
All right, but you asked for it.
Asked for what?
Let go of me!
Don't you dare go boneless on me, Shawn!
Okay!
Lower back.
You see? 
That's why it's not... 
Oh! 
You son of a bitch!
You wanted to see me?
Yes, I did. 
I have a project for you. 
Have a seat.
Is that your wife?
My grandmother.
Tell her I said she's lovely.
She died.
I'm going to sit down now.
Lots of talk about this in the office.
Yes, sir. 
I'm aware of that, and I've already taken care of it.
I don't think you have.
When my wife and I moved into our house, we were met with a series of unexplained disturbances.
Perhaps fueled by my wife's predilection for the supernatural.
Well, after a while it stopped.
But recently, these occurrences have returned.
To the point where my wife is staying with her mother.
Mr. Haversham, why are you telling me this?
Because I believe my wife believes our house is haunted, and I would like to hire you.
Gus, I had a strange feeling I was needed.
Cool, huh? 
Looks like word getting out about you moonlighting isn't the worst thing in the world.
Let's be clear. 
Haversham is the most powerful man in this office.
He's gonna be running this company sometime soon.
Give the man the respect he deserves.
What is this?
His company bio. 
Learn it.
"Bred for success"?
His father is William Haversham. 
Genius entrepreneur.
This guy grew up under the tutelage of a business master and real estate magnate.
I know him. 
He's the one who built the Poliodome.
Polodome.
That's a much less depressing name. 
Should we go?
No. 
Meet me at Haversham's at 7:00.
I think I can handle that.
And no whimpering. 
And no screaming. 
No running from anything.
I don't care how spooky his old house is.
Haversham thinks my nickname is Fearless Guster.
Well, do you want to start some sort of recording device?
No. 
I don't record my sessions. 
I prefer just to talk.
How do you remember the important things?
You've heard of a photographic memory?
Well, I have a bit of... 
I guess you'd call it an eidetic tonal memory.
So, you'll remember everything I've said?
Pretty much. 
Yes.
Would you like to start?
Yes, first question, where's the bug?
The what?
The bug.
Nothing new in this area. 
Must be concealed on your person.
I honestly don't have anything on me.
Then you wouldn't be opposed to me patting you down?
Actually, I'm very opposed to that.
Would you be willing to submit to a polygraph?
Shawn, don't do this to me. 
You are late.
At this moment, you are officially late!
Just call me when you get here.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
I just heard you squeak.
Damn you, Shawn! 
I thought you were a ghost from outside.
And yet, you still came in all by your lonesome.
Fearless Guster impresses.
How did you get inside the house?
Hadewych, the housekeeper. 
She was leaving so she let me in.
Tiny little dollop of a woman, Dutch-Indonesian.
Enormous forearms.
She made me a pannekoek.
It's like a pancake but it is the size of a manhole cover!
Are you wearing Haversham's robe?
Yep. 
You should try it. 
The worm that spins this silk is extinct. 
You can't find these.
Take it off.
I can't.
Hello?
Where are your clothes?
In the dryer.
In the dryer?
Well, the sauna was a little bit hotter than I was expecting!
Mr. Haversham.
We got here early.
Hadewych let us in. 
We love her, and we'd like one of our own.
Is that an ascot?
Yes. 
Yes, it is.
I like it.
It's a classic accoutrement.
It's nice to see someone with a sense of tradition.
Gus and I are both huge fans of the classics.
To be completely honest, I'm surprised he isn't wearing his spats this evening.
Can we see the epicenter of the ghoulish activity?
Please, don't touch anything.
I'm sorry, Mr. Haversham, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to touch absolutely everything.
Including this naked lady lamp.
I almost might have to sniff some stuff.
Possibly lick some things. 
These Tootsie Roll pops come to mind.
Are you a skeptic, sir?
Elaine's the real believer, so I guess you could say that.
Just as I thought.
Please leave.
What?
Shawn!
I'm sorry, sir.
You are a skeptic.
Therefore, you must wait in the hall, preferably at the end.
You're killing all of my jujubes.
Jujubes are candies.
Exactly.
You better take off that robe.
I will.
And I know what you're trying to do.
What? 
Innocently flip through a photo album?
No. 
You're sabotaging this on purpose.
Why would I do that?
To get me fired so I have no other choice but to go back to Psych.
That's actually an ingenious plan.
But that's not how I play, Gus.
I play fair, and I roll hard.
I'm gonna find this man's ghost and I will rid him of it.
Did Haversham have any enemies?
Not really. 
Corporate thinks he's a magician.
He completely revamped our inventory system.
Really? 
Whole system from A to Z, including M?
All the vowels? 
This guy sounds like a real maverick.
Mr. Haversham, allow me to say this is my most valuable work experience yet.
Well? 
Allow me to say that I'm not impressed.
Duly noted.
Magnum! 
Quiet, boy!
Stop that!
Quiet, boy!
What is he barking at?
I don't know, he never barks.
Come on, boy. 
Come on, that's it. 
Here we go.
Dude, look at you. 
You were cool as a cucumber while that went down.
Fearless Guster is a badass.
Let's check the basement.
I can't.
Why not?
My feet won't move.
So? 
How did it go?
I'm winning.
How are you winning?
I answered every question in character as Tom "Gunny" Highway.
Who is Tom "Gunny" Highway?
Clint Eastwood's character in Heartbreak Ridge.
It's not a contest, Carlton.
Don't kid yourself, O'Hara, you'll only come out losing.
Losing what?
Why are we going to the basement?
Because, Gus, that's where ghosts do their thing. 
It's cold, and dark, and dusty.
Excuse me.
Can I help you two? 
Yeah, we're just gonna check out the basement.
We don't go to the basement.
He doesn't go to the basement.
Why is that?
Mold spores. 
My wife had some workers here.
You can get to the door, but you can't get in 'cause it's bolted shut.
I still think it's probably worth...
Is that hot chocolate?
It's Dutch cocoa. 
Hadewych makes a pot for me each night before she leaves.
I see. 
Mr. Haversham, in order to fully understand the connection that you have with this ghost, I will need to see what you see, wear what you wear, drink what you drink.
You're saying you'd like some hot chocolate?
Yes. 
With marshmallows, please.
Right.
What? 
It's Dutch!
It tastes like it was dipped straight out of Willy Wonka's river.
Would you get serious?
Well, he's not the most gracious host, you know.
If he'd just offered I wouldn't have had to ask.
And that pannekoek? 
Not nearly as filling as it may have seemed.
You're getting hot chocolate on the floor.
Did you see that?
What the hell is...
Magnum! 
Down, boy!
That dog is kind of an "A" hole.
It sees something.
Yeah, urine stains on my pants.
So, what do we do now?
I think we stay here. 
We close the blinds.
We lock the doors. 
We call it a night.
Del Taco? 
Del Taco?
No, not me.
I'm going out there.
Are you kidding me?
Shawn, this is what we do.
There's a ghost out there, so would you cut the...
We need to do this...
Okay, fine.
Do you have high-end energy efficient xenon flashlights?
Pardon me for saying so, but Fearless Guster sucks.
I don't care what you say, we're solving this case. 
So suck it up.
Suck what up?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about? 
I don't know. 
You got my mind all messed up.
I'm going that direction.
She went that way.
Good luck.
Hey, it's me. 
Not letting you do this alone.
Where is he?
I got her!
What do you mean, you got her?
What is going on here?
I don't know.
I realized something.
Yesterday, with all that talk about weapons,
I neglected to ask you a very important question.
What kind of gun do you carry?
Would you like to see it?
I would love to.
Picked this up with a little extra cash after I decided not to go with a divorce attorney.
You're going through a separation?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, it's...
You know, she went with one of these high-powered ambulance chasers but that's just her insecurities, you know.
You know who you remind me of?
Who?
Did you ever see that movie Heartbreak Ridge?
Mold spores, Shawn.
Well, I'm attracted to places I'm not allowed to go.
Good luck with your stachybotros virus.
Listen, man, we need to wrap this up quickly.
I have dinner plans with my mom tonight.
I've hardly had a chance to see her at all. 
Shawn.
What? 
Hadewych!
It's okay, I'm Shawn Spencer, it's me and my partner, Lemongrass Gogoloab.
Have you noticed anything strange?
Only now.
We saw a woman in the woods last night that may not have been alive.
Saturday, the missus, she leave.
Go to mother's, yes? 
Sunday, I forget my bag, come back.
I hear voices, lady voices in the house.
What did you do?
I leave. 
Too much strangeness here lately.
Something's off with that woman, Shawn.
Okay. 
Nothing's happening.
I gotta go.
What?
Gus, we made plans.
My dad has been manipulating her time all week.
Shawn, let me be clear. 
I'm not leaving here until Haversham not only wants me to keep moonlighting at Psych forever, but also makes me a partner.
Sorry, buddy.
Wait, what's this?
Are you leaving?
Mr. Haversham, it is my belief that we have done all there is to do here tonight.
Tomorrow, we will look into the history of the house, see if there's anything there that can help us.
Just don't have any leads at this point.
So, I think we should all pat each other on the backs for a job well done so far, reconvene first thing in the morning for a nice farmer's breakfast.
I have dinner plans with my mother.
Oh, you made it. 
I was sure you weren't gonna make it.
I'm sorry, Ma. 
You've no idea the day I've just had.
Well, I'm just running to the ladies'. 
We're right over there.
We?
Oh. 
Your father was lonely and I thought I might have to eat dinner alone, so I let him tag along.
That's fine, right?
You're absolutely certain he's my father?
Oh! 
Hey, Shawn. 
Grab a menu. 
We already ordered. 
I'm sure it's all right.
All right, what is this?
What is what?
This. 
What is all of this? 
The aftershave, pumiced scalp, the suit.
I can wear a suit. 
Which one of the three tenors did you borrow that from?
Not the dead one, I hope.
It's my suit, Shawn. 
I dress up occasionally. 
You have a problem with that?
No.
I have a problem with this pretend Henry that showed up when Mom got to town.
I don't know where you're going with this.
You're acting like a phony and you know it, and it's bugging the hell out of me. 
Look at yourself!
Shawn, I order a braised quail salad and all of a sudden you think I'm putting on airs?
Excuse me. 
Who here has the guinea hen crostone with the liver pancetta?
That'd be me.
Everybody here is ordering it.
Look, I'm...
I'm just gonna make this easier for both of us, okay?
I know exactly what you're up to.
And I'm not gonna let it happen.
Let what happen, Shawn?
Yeah, if you don't mind my saying so, you've been a real jerk to me all week.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that your mother was coming back into town.
I'm sorry you think that I messed up your whole youth.
I'm sorry you think that I screwed up your life.
Get over it.
You had your chance.
Now, leave her alone.
Shawn...
Did you know that Ogletree raises carrier pigeons?
Hello?
Hello?
That's strange.
Who called?
Me.
You?
Well, there it is again. 
That's my number.
From work?
No, from here.
The call is coming from inside the house.
Put it on speaker.
Hello?
Who is this?
Does this number have any other extensions?
No. 
Well, there's one, but it's not plugged in.
Where is it?
I'll go check it out.
It's up in the attic.
The attic?
I'll stay on the line.
You... 
Good luck.
Come on. 
Don't be mad.
You haunted my boss' house?
It was the only way to show him how important and needed you are.
Look how brave you've been.
If we're being honest, I think this has been a real confidence booster for you, buddy.
Plus, once you solve the case, you're a hero, he never bothers you again.
Maybe you get a numbered space in the green lot.
Shawn, stop it.
How did you even...
Gus. 
Friday, after you quit our business,
I went to your office in hopes of haunting your Regional Sales Manager,
Ogletree. 
Unfortunately, he doesn't believe in ghosts, so I had to go a little higher on the rung.
Luckily for me, Katie from Accounts Receivable gave me a little tip about Haversham's wife.
I finally got to use my air conditioner and heating guy disguise.
I had an ultrasonic beeper in my pocket for the dog.
I actually thought you caught that one for a second.
Dude, hear me.
Hadewych!
Don't ever, ever put dry ice in your mouth.
Doesn't matter how well you wrap it up.
Okay. 
What about the old woman?
Young woman. 
She does Shakespeare in the Parking Lot down at the Albertsons by La Cumbre Plaza.
She was all stoked to finally have a paying gig.
And ditching the dress in the woods?
That was just an improv because who knew Fearless Guster would come after her, you badass.
The rest of it was pretty simple, really.
I even visited Alice Bundy in prison to get a few pointers.
How do we solve it?
Solve what?
The ghost. 
How do we solve a case where you're the culprit?
That is a very good question.
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought that far ahead?
Well, give me a second.
I'm hiding under the towel.
And then I realize, the towel is my life, and the pool is third grade, and the high dive is my father.
Wow!
Oh, wow, I...
I poured out to you secrets even I didn't know I had.
That was amazing!
I mean, so liberating to trust someone with your darkest innermost secrets.
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been here before?
I used to be here quite a bit.
I just recently came back.
I know someone here who works for the department occasionally.
Actually, he's my son.
Really? 
Well, you know, I know pretty much everybody who comes through the department.
What's his name?
Shawn Spencer.
Ghost gone.
Just like that?
Just like that. 
It's split.
It's history. 
Will not be bothering you again. 
And that is a guarantee.
One hundred percent.
How can you guarantee?
Please, don't ask. 
Just enjoy.
And now, regarding our fee. 
Of course, there will be no charge.
Knowing that you appreciate the work that Gus does for the community...
And for the company. 
It's more than enough reward.
But if you were to insist on some sort of expense reimbursement, we, of course, would not accept.
Hmm. 
Please, have a seat.
I have a bit of a sixth sense myself, Mr. Guster.
Helps me out when a business deal is about to go south.
And it's bothering me right now.
I don't understand this guarantee, and I don't like it.
Last night, when that call came in, Guster, you went upstairs.
At the end of that call, I heard something that made me question all of this.
All right, yeah. 
Okay.
You know that everyone gives off energy, right?
It's scientifically proven.
They got these cameras that can record what color you are when you're feeling different things.
People that are angry give off a different color than people that are sad.
See this ring?
This ring can supposedly tell you what you're feeling.
Let's see what you're feeling right now.
Yellow! 
That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.
You must be about to laugh or something.
It's probably just about to come out.
We'll wait.
We got all day.
Oh, my God. 
There it is! 
Cool.
That ring really works. 
That's amazing.
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Look at this.
My sister sent it to me.
It was taken an hour ago at the Philadelphia Zoo.
Mother of God, what kind of terrorists are these?
They're not sure it's terrorists now.
Moments ago, in an official statement, the government moved away from its initial position that this was a terrorist attack.
Authorities are now feeling, by the sheer number of incidents being reported, that a terrorist group being responsible is becoming less and less likely.
The event appears to be limited to the Northeast, where smaller and smaller towns are being attacked.
Where are we?
The infected area now includes most of New England, from Massachusetts to Maryland.
We're dead center.
Everything okay?
If we stay here, we are gonna die here.
Whatever this is, it looks like it's not occurring about 90 miles from here.
Let's go.
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?
Hey!
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, could we get a ride, please?
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!
- We have a little girl with us. 
Please.
- Drive. 
Just roll up the window.
Sir! 
You're not just going to...
Can you believe how crappy people are?
There's a car.
Hi. 
I run a plant nursery up the street.
We're picking up a few things from home, then heading wherever this isn't happening.
We have room.
- We have two others.
- That's okay.
Julian!
Is Julian okay?
We got a ride. 
He can fit all of us.
Elliot, I can't get Evette on the phone or e-mail or nothing.
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.
She was on that bus headed to Princeton.
There's a car over there headed to pick up friends and family, they said they could squeeze one more.
We got to go.
Look, think real carefully about this.
She was looking for a birthday present for Jess.
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.
I'm just gonna go get her and I want to bring her back, and then I'm gonna find you guys.
I just... 
I need you to take Jess, okay?
She's gonna be a lot safer with you.
Don't do this to me.
I'm doing my best here not to fall down.
I'm sure the probability of Princeton not being hit is good.
Yeah.
You want me to throw some figures and percentages at you so we both feel better?
- Please.
- All right.
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.
I have to go.
I got her, Julian.
Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it.
I'm going to go get Mommy.
Hold our picture.
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.
We're packing hot dogs for the road.
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.
They've got a cool shape, they've got protein.
You like hot dogs, right?
By the way, I think I know what's causing this.
- You do?
- It's the plants.
They can release chemicals.
You like hot dogs, don't you?
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going, but we will be back soon, okay?
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.
Did you get the mustard?
Don't look outside. 
Stop it!
Stop it! 
Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!
Close the vents.
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.
What?
How much would you have if I said I would pay you a penny on the first day and then two pennies on the second, and then four pennies on the third day and I just kept doubling it and I did this for a month?
How much money would you have at the end of the month?
- Ten dollars.
- No, higher. 
Higher, higher.
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.
Twenty dollars?
No, keep going. 
Keep going.
Thirty. 
It's thirty. 
It's $30.
I'm gonna tell you the answer.
It's over $10 million.
You'd have over $10 million at the end of the month.
You want to hear another one?
Water contamination has surfaced as one of the many theories being taken seriously as to the cause of the events in the Northeast.
We have to go through this little community of homes.
Small town called Holcomb, then we hit the highway.
From there, we're 30 miles from the state line.
Are those dead animals up ahead?
Stop the car.
- You don't think it's...
- I don't know.
You got binoculars in the back, from when you were spying on our neighbors.
Can I have the map?
Elliot...
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.
How could it not be bodies?
Please, give me the map.
Well, we have to turn around.
There's a right turn about a quarter of a mile back.
We're just gonna take a different route, honey, okay?
Oh, it's the Army. 
We're safe!
My name is Private Auster.
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base, about 10 miles back.
I think they've been affected by whatever's happening.
I lost communication with them.
When I approached the base,
I saw military personnel in the barbed wire, in the fence.
So I suggest no one take that road.
There's a town about eight miles behind us.
There were bodies on the road into town.
Cheese and crackers.
Well, that still leaves us two directions.
Just stop! 
Stop the vehicle!
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?
We have no communication with anybody.
- I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?
Hello! 
Please stop!
Excuse me.
Who's Joey?
Oh, it's no one.
Any luck?
I can't get Julian on his cell phone.
I'm sure he'll be all right. 
They'll be okay.
Has anyone seen any other people on the roads?
Maybe he's on to something.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
Why did it start in parks?
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.
They say there's a bus in a lake.
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.
Okay.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.
There's a woman talking to her daughter.
She's talking to her daughter in Princeton.
Isn't that where your friend went?
Come on.
It's okay. 
Honey, it's okay.
She's so scared.
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.
Just keep watching out the window with the tree, baby.
Someone will come and get you soon.
Tell her not to go near the window with the tree. 
Just tell her.
Baby, don't go near the window with the tree.
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.
Honey, someone wants to know if Princeton's had any problems.
She says everyone's dead outside.
You just stay in your room.
Honey?
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean? 
Everyone's dead?
- What?
Stacy... 
Stacy, you're scaring me.
I don't understand what you're saying.
What, baby?
She's just not making any sense.
Calculus.
I see in calculus.
Calculus.
- Stacy!
- Calculus.
Stacy!
Stacy Ann!
Oh, my God.
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.
Oh, no!
We're going to go back to the car, okay, Jess?
If we went down that road, where would that take us?
I walked down a quarter mile, it was clean.
I can't tell you what's after that, but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.
- Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.
Hey, it's better than going back the other way.
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?
Yeah. 
He never gives up.
You know, plants have the ability to target specific threats.
Tobacco plants, when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars.
We don't know how plants attain these abilities.
They just evolve very rapidly.
Which species do you think is doing it if you think it's true?
Plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants.
Trees can communicate with bushes, bushes with grass and everything in between.
The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads.
That's right.
Whatever's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations.
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.
The terrorists, or whatever could be watching the roads.
I don't have any reason to disagree right now.
We are in the area of attack.
If you can't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked.
They're attacking populations.
We need to go where there aren't that many people.
Where people don't travel.
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.
If we go west, we'll hit a county called Arundell.
It's not on that map.
It would only be on local maps.
Dirt roads. 
Hardly anybody lives out there.
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?
We should go into two groups.
Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars.
We need to stay in groups. 
Stay together.
We'll go soon, honey. 
We'll go soon.
Maybe we should've waited for the rest of them, stayed in a big group, like the Private said.
Your phone's out, too?
What's wrong?
Okay. 
I was going to tell you, okay?
There was this guy, Joey.
His name is Joey. 
He's at work.
We went out and we had dessert.
I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late.
And I didn't work late.
I'm feeling really guilty in case we're gonna die.
I just wanted you to know that.
You lied to me?
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!
Private Auster?
My firearm is my friend.
Jesus.
Oh, no.
What, "Oh, no"?
The toxin?
The toxin is affecting them?
Are those people killing themselves?
You were with the Private.
What do we do?
- We need to do something!
- Just let me think.
- They're dying!
- I need a second.
They released it? 
We're not near the roads.
We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers!
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!
We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something!
- We're not assholes!
- Just a second!
There were children in that group!
- Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!
Why can't anybody give me a goddamn second?
All right, be scientific, douchebag.
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Interpret the experimental data. 
Interpret.
What if it is the plants?
Their group was larger than ours.
This thing has been escalating all day.
Smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off.
They react to human stimulus.
Maybe people are setting off the plants?
What are you saying? 
That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.
They're already dead.
What if they're targeting us as threats?
This part of the field may not have been set off.
Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there's too many of us together.
Let's just stay ahead of the wind.
Let's just break up into groups.
Come on! 
Come on! 
This way!
Come on, follow me!
I'm right here! 
Keep going!
I'm right behind you!
Here it comes!
Don't you let go of my hand.
Nothing happened.
It's the size of the groups, I think.
Could this really be happening?
What are your names?
- Jared.
- Josh.
Wait, wait!
I'm going to go see if that truck has a map.
You guys wait here.
Why aren't they looking into nuclear power plants?
There are 15 or more in the Northeast alone.
More than anywhere else in the United States.
There's probably been some leak or something.
It's probably poisoning the air.
There's a house over there! 
Come on!
It could have been some terrorist booby-trap, someone stepped on it out in the field.
Yeah, in a field in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.
I don't know.
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.
The source had to be close to that field, if not in the field.
Here's one.
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.
You think it could be plants?
I don't know.
But if it is, and people are setting it off in groups, we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe.
We can't walk to the borders where this isn't happening, Alma. 
It's too far.
Whatever it is, terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants, it's probably safe to get away from people right now.
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.
Hurry.
Hello?
My name is Elliot Moore.
I'm just going to talk in a very positive manner.
Giving off good vibes.
We're just here to use the bathroom and then we're just gonna leave.
I hope that's okay.
Plastic.
I'm talking to a plastic plant.
I'm still doing it.
You guys ready to leave?
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?
Hey, everything's fake.
Why is this happening?
I don't know for sure, Josh.
But I read this article about the coast of Australia.
It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria.
It hadn't been around for billions of years, it just appeared in the water.
It's toxic to humans, fishermen who come in contact with it are dying.
It feels kind of similar to that.
With the bees disappearing, I mean, I don't know, it feels like a pattern.
The nature of events like the one in Australia is that they crest and then stop.
We just have to be alive when it's over.
I don't believe it's nature.
It may not be. 
There could be some other explanation. 
I don't know.
Let's go.
There are people coming!
We can't stay here. 
It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.
There's two groups coming together.
There's too many of them together.
Run. 
Run.
- Is she your kid?
- No.
- You got kids?
- No.
How come? 
You got a problem?
No. 
She wanted to wait.
Really? 
For what?
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?
Sweet. 
I used to love those. 
Can I see it?
You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship.
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. 
Thank you.
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.
- Elliot! 
Look!
- Come on.
Oh, wow.
...is an emergency broadcast.
All those who are still inside the affected area of the Northeast are asked to proceed to the police borders west of your state.
Come on.
This is an emergency broadcast.
...inside the affected area...
Jess needs a 10-minute rest and some food.
Are you sure? 
We should keep going.
I know, but she's only eight.
What?
If we're going to die, I want you to know something.
I was in the pharmacy a while ago, and there was a really good-looking pharmacist behind the counter.
Really good-looking.
And I went up and I asked her where the cough syrup was.
I didn't even have a cough.
And I almost bought it.
And I'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup.
That's like six bucks.
Are you joking?
Thank you.
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.
Mr. Moore, I think I can open this door.
Wait. 
We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.
We're just gonna get some food for Jess.
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's lived here for a long time anyway.
I mean, it's all boarded up.
Maybe we could leave some money.
- What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.
Not so high.
Okay, Josh, open the door.
Wait!
I see something.
- There's somebody in there!
- You sure?
Yeah, I saw him move.
I see him!
Let's stop.
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.
- We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.
You ain't gonna bring that poison gas in here with you.
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.
Nothing's happened out here yet.
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.
We're perfectly normal.
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon Won't you keep on shining on me?
See? 
We're normal.
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.
Okay. 
It's not worth it.
Open the door, bitch!
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! 
Jess, come here.
Stop it, Jess. 
Listen, we just want some food for a little girl, you pussies!
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.
You'd best not let that gas in here.
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.
- You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...
No!
Jared!
We're gonna get out of this nightmare.
Elliot!
We have to go. 
We have to protect Jess.
Okay?
You've got to three to get off our porch!
Come here.
No new people have crossed over the border for a few hours.
It appears those residents that are still in the affected area of the Northeast are trying to wait it out.
We have Professor Kendel Wallace of Carnegie Mellon, a statistician, here with us.
Professor, what can you tell us?
Calculating by the rise in intensity of reports of incidents within the affected area, one can guess at a crude timetable.
One can see the incident is rising in sensitivity.
We've seen fewer and fewer people can provoke the attacks.
The event should be at its most sensitive tomorrow morning.
Typically, these type of slopes drop precipitously after cresting, meaning it could end suddenly, at any moment.
Of course, these are only probabilities.
There are some quiet rumblings that the government may be involved in the tragic events playing out in the Northeast.
Now, these rumors have been fuelled by the statements of a confidential informant who claims that the CIA has facilities in the Northeast, where they are testing drugs with some similar psychotropic properties as a defense against chemical weapons.
CIA and White House officials have declined to respond to these accusations.
Perimeters have been set up all along the East Coast from Maryland all the way to Massachusetts.
This house has no power going to it.
Nobody's driven on this driveway for a long time, either.
Let me go. 
You guys stay right here.
That's for Clement.
He's a retriever.
You lost?
You must be.
There ain't nothing around here for miles.
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?
I suppose the kind thing for me to do is to offer you supper.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
I hope the meal was sufficient.
I wasn't expecting guests.
This is a beautiful place.
There's a springhouse in the back.
They used to hide people from slave chasers back there.
It has a speaking tube running under the ground to the main house.
You can hear each other like you were in the same room.
So, what's with you two?
Who's chasing who?
I'm sorry?
Ain't no time two people staring at each other, standing still, love in both their eyes, at the same time, equal.
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.
That's the way we's built.
So?
Who's chasing?
I knew that. 
I knew that.
Don't touch things that aren't yours.
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.
I got enough to fill my time right here.
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.
Although I ain't got the touch.
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.
- How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.
How would you know if something were to happen? 
Like a world event?
Mrs. Jones, something's happened along the East Coast.
Whatever it is that you think is so important that you need to tell me, don't.
Just keep it to yourself.
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.
Suppose I have to let you spend the night.
Guest room's up on the left.
Mind the steps.
I'm scared, Elliot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. 
I was being stupid.
You've been great taking care of Jess.
I don't like this woman.
There's something Exorcist-y about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?
Well, we need to stay in this house.
You want me to protect you, this is how we have to do it.
Let's just deal with her.
I hear you whispering.
Planning on stealing something?
No, ma'am, we're not.
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?
What? 
No!
Mrs. Jones?
Mrs. Jones?
Crazy lady.
You trying to steal my things?
No! 
No, Mrs. Jones, I actually wanted to talk with you.
- You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.
There's something happening in a few states, in this region.
- It's not safe!
- Leave now!
The Lord is my shepherd.
The Lord is my shepherd.
Mrs. Jones, could we talk calmly for a second?
Just hear me out. 
See, I'm a teacher...
Mrs. Jones?
Oh, my God.
Alma, shut the windows and the doors!
Alma?
Alma?
Alma?
Jess?
Hi, froggie! 
Hi, froggie!
Okay, yeah. 
Wait.
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? 
I think he's a baby.
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.
Oh, he got water on my shoe.
Isn't this a cool house?
If we had this house, we could make it look so pretty.
Get him again. 
Get him again.
Hey, froggie.
Alma?
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.
- Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?
Mrs. Jones just died. 
Close the windows.
Close the door, Jess!
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?
It's happening here.
It could be the grass and the trees are doing this now.
She was alone when it happened.
Seems like they might have gotten more sensitive.
It's too dangerous to go outside, isn't it?
Yes.
This is the end, isn't it?
I wish you were here.
Me, too.
You remember our first date?
You were so quiet.
You bought me the mood ring.
It turned purple when you wore it.
Then you said, "That means you're in love."
It got you to talk, didn't it?
Then we checked the little paper chart, and it turned out that purple meant I was horny.
- You loved that.
- I had no idea.
Yours was blue. 
Peaceful, right?
Right.
What color was love?
I don't remember.
Me, neither.
Elliot?
Yeah?
I was just making sure you're there.
It's not right for it to end like this.
If we're gonna die, I want to be with you.
I want to be with you, and I'm gonna come and be with you.
Elliot, don't!
The event must have ended before we went out there.
I found the hair clip!
You don't want to be late for the first day schools are open.
Oh, wait.
I'm just gonna put this right here.
Okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. 
I love you.
I love you, too. 
Come here.
All right. 
I'll pick you up after you're done with school, okay?
Bye.
As everyone knows by now, traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees.
Now, most environmentalists feel that this event is like the red tide in the ocean, but instead of algae killing fish, this happened on land.
Now, plants and trees just can't pick up and move when they feel threatened, like other species.
They have only one option, to rapidly evolve their chemistry.
Well.
Kay from Mississippi wants to know why it started so suddenly, on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.
Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest, this was an act of nature, and we'll never fully understand it.
And, Doctor, there's been a lot of speculation as to why this happened in the Northeast only.
How do you explain that?
Well, I believe, all right, and this is just my opinion, that this was a prelude, okay?
A warning, like the first spot of a rash.
We have become a threat to this planet.
I don't think anybody will argue that.
- And this is a warning.
- A warning?
I think the skeptics would believe that if it had occurred anywhere else.
That's why most people believe it was the government.
If it had happened in one other place, anywhere else, we could all believe what you're saying.
I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work.
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?
I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work.
That frightened me.
I should drop my bicycle off
What?
My God...
My bicycle.

I forgot where I am.
You're at the place where the killers meet to decide what to do with the crippled girl.
Oh, that's right. 
That's right.
Did you hear that?
That's funny.
That's weird. 
Those people look like they're clawing at themselves.
Is that blood?
claire, are you seeing this?
claire.
claire?
claire?
What page was I on?
Page.
-I need an extension over here.
-FaII back. 
fall back.
You kidding me? 
Like another 20 feet.
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.
I told you he wouldn't do it!
So then the little guy says,
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY."'
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says, 'WeIcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'
Christ, McKenzie fell.
Medic, we have a major accident at the south side of the building.
-We'II need an ambulance.
Copy.
Jesus.
Give him some room.
-Hey!
-Somebody fell!
-Davis?
-Oh, my God, he just fell!
Someone fell! 
Over that building!
Oh, my God!
-Watch it.
-Oh, my God!
Watch it. 
Get out of there!
-help!
-Look out!
Look out!
God in heaven.
Look, I don't know if you guys have heard about this article in The New York Times about honeybees vanishing?
well, apparently, honeybees are disappearing all over the country.
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.
It's scary, huh?
AII right, Iet's hear some theories about why this might be happening.
Nothing? 
Come on, guys.
-Laura.
-Disease?
Right. 
could be a virus or infection.
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.
It's a little tricky.
-pollution?
-could be.
I mean, we're just pumping so much junk into the environment they're just keeIing over.
But there are no bodies. 
Keep guessing.
dylan.
global warming.
Temperature goes up a fraction of a degree, makes them disoriented?
Maybe.
Jake?
You don't have an opinion?
You're not interested in what happened to the bees?
You should be more interested in science, Jake.
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.
The problem is, your face is perfect at 15.
Now, if you were interested in science, you would know facts
like the human nose and ears grow a fraction of an inch each year.
So a perfect balance of features now might not look so perfect five years from now.
They might look downright whack 10 years from now.
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.
What could be a reason the bees have vanished?
An act of nature and we'II never fully understand it.
Nice answer, Jake.
He's right.
I mean, science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but in the end, it'II be just a theory.
We will faiI to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding.
To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature.
Jake?
How much does the human nose grow each year?
-Oh, man.
-It's minuscule, buddy, okay?
Don't worry about it. 
You're gonna be a heartthrob your whole life.
I was just messing with you.
The Dark Lord. 
Don't look into her eyes.
Vice principal! 
What can we do for you?
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you for a moment, Mr. Moore.
Okay, guys, calm down. 
I'II be right back.
-What is that?
-I can't believe it.
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.
-I've never seen anything like it before.
-What's going on?
I don't know.
You excused all the teachers?
The administration makes us teach with a foot of snow on the ground.
What is this?
-They stopped class.
-elliot!
AII right.
There appears to be an event happening.
central Park was just hit by what seems to be a terrorist attack.
Oh, no.
They're not clear on the scale yet.
It's some kind of airborne chemical toxin that's been released in and around the park.
They said to watch for warning signs.
The first stage is confused speech.
The second stage is physical disorientation, loss of direction.
The third stage is fatal.
central Park? 
That's kind of odd.
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.
So take your planners home so we can get back when this is over.
AII right? 
Let's do our jobs.
Hey, you guys still got to work on your science projects for next week.
What are the rules of scientific investigation?
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.
careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.
Hey, guys?
Nothing.
AIacrity. 
With alacrity, please.
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. 
hysterical.
I told her the probability of something happening in philadelphia is very low.
I mean, nobody's telling us to leave the city, right?
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.
You know, people are comforted by percentages. 
Didn't work.
She still wants us to get out of the city and come out to her house.
But she said for you and alma to come.
Yeah, Iet me think about that, okay?
Did you hear about New York?
Are you okay?
No, I mean, are you okay?
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.
julian's mom offered for all of us to get out of the city and stay with her.
What do you think?
Yo, Chris!
I'II bring Jess and Evette and I'II meet you at the station.
Listen, julian, if alma's acting weird, just be cool, okay?
What's going on?
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?
Odd?
Look, if she's acting like she's distant or something...
What?
I can't say any more.
Is she leaving you?
I didn't say that. 
It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?
Hey.
I'm going to tell you something you should never tell your best friend.
Why is everybody saying that?
I saw her on your wedding day.
Again with the wedding. 
What?
I walked into a waiting room by mistake, and she was crying.
She looked up. 
I saw her face.
She wasn't ready to jump in, elliot.
That's not who she is.
She's never going to jump in when you need her, man.
So do federal. state and local officials have a plan in place for this type of catastrophe?
Are they utilizing all the manpower or the money...
-Hi.
-Are you packed?
-Yes.
-What are they saying?
They're evacuating New York City.
Well. our brains come equipped with a selfpreservation mechanism to stop us from harmful actions.
This is controlled by a combination of electrochemical signals in the brain.
The blocking of neurotransmitters by certain toxins has been proven to cause hallucinations.
asphyxiation and paralysis.
This new neurotoxin is basically flipping the preservation switch.
blocking neurotransmitters in a specific order.
causing specific selfdamaging and catastrophic effects.
Just how the toxin works and who the terrorists are...
It makes you kill yourself.
Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that could be invented.
I'II be packed in two minutes.
Hello?
-No need to rush.
-Sir. 
Thank you.
Sir, we need to check your suitcase.
elliot! 
elliot! 
elliot!
This just in to the Eyewitness News room and this is the latest development.
Autopsies on the first victims confirm the toxin is a natural compound.
The attacks remain confined to the New York metropolitan area.
This is a very. very disturbing story...
Track three now boarding for Harrisburg.
Hey, Jess. 
Where's Evette?
She was at a shop across town, she got stuck in traffic.
-She's gonna take the next train.
-We'II wait.
No, no, no. 
She wanted us to get on this train with Jess.
She'II feel a Iot safer.
-Where's alma?
-Restroom.
Hey, julian!
please have your tickets out and ready, ladies and gentlemen.
I bought them.
It was like getting one of those Cabbage Patch dolls when they first came out.
Madhouse. 
How are you?
-Good. 
You?
-Good.
-Okay, good. 
Why don't we all...
-I'm really glad you chose to come.
Thanks. 
elliot, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
please show me your tickets, ladies and gentlemen.
-You told him about our fight?
-No.
-Why did he say that?
-He guessed.
I Iove you, elliot, but I don't like to put my feelings out there for everyone to see.
I'm not that type of person.
elliot, these are our problems.
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.
By the time we get there I'II be fine.
Is that okay?
Fine.
I'm going to get on the train.
We're not gonna get to sit together anyways.
Okay.
Hey, babe.
-Hi, Aunt alma.
-How you doing?
-Hanging in there.
-Me, too.
-What's wrong with you?
-What?
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.
Come on, don't get all sensitive.
-Just give her a chance.
-Okay, fine. 
If you don't want my help...
-I don't want your help!
-Okay. 
I heard it.
Jess, could you ask your dad for my ticket, please?
Thank you. 
I'II see you on the train, Jess.
Track 3 now boarding all ticketed passengers.
Here we go.
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.
-Come on. 
Come on. 
I know. 
I know.
-Mom.
-chilly, isn't it today, sal?
-Maybe a little.
Hey, it's me. 
I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?
You've got to stop calling me.
You're acting like the Fatal Attraction guy, here.
I feel like I'm going to take a shower and see your silhouette on the shower curtain.
We ate tiramisu together, that is it.
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.
What?
When?
In philadelphia?
-I don't know. 
What did you hear?
-Oh, my God. 
I can't believe it.
What's the news?
apparently philadelphia was just attacked.
-Oh, my God. 
Evette.
-call Mommy. 
call Mommy!
Honey!
Honey... 
Yeah, yeah, where are you?
What? 
What? 
I can't hear you.
I said I can't hear you! 
Text me.
Text me. 
I can't hear you!
They think it started in Rittenhouse Square Park.
Another park?
-She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
-I want to talk to her.
I know, baby. 
I know. 
She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.
I want to talk to her.
-Do you have a phone?
-No, I'm sorry.
-You okay?
-They say Boston got hit, too.
-Where'd you hear that?
-A friend from work. 
What about Evette?
Oh, God. 
She made it out on a bus.
What the hell is going on, elliot?
I honestly don't know.
Now what?
It just stopped. 
I don't know.
-Can't go nowhere.
-They're not telling us anything.
-well, until we hear from...
-Sir?
Train service has been discontinued.
This will be the Iast stop for all passengers.
Hey! 
What do you mean? 
Where are we?
FiIbert, pennsylvania.
FiIbert?
Does anybody know where that is?
Why are you giving me one useless piece of information at a time?
What's going on?
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.
Sir, we lost contact.
With whom?
Everyone.
I'm scared. 
I don't like it here. 
I want Mom.
Don't be silly. 
We're safe here, okay?
Sorry. 
She whispers to us when she gets scared.
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.
She's shivering.
I know. 
I know.
She's never right without her mom.
It's okay.
They're not saying anything.
We're stuck here.
Is Jess okay?
She's not talking.
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.
Don't know what you want?
Then just have the grilled cheese plain with milk, okay?
Come on, come over here.
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.
What?
AII right, you want to come with me?
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?
Bro! 
Bro, I got it. 
Go get the milk.
AII right, yeah. 
Okay.
You know that everyone gives off energy, right?
It's scientifically proven.
They got these cameras that can record what color you are when you're feeling different things.
people that are angry give off a different color than people that are sad.
See this ring?
This ring can supposedly tell you what you're feeling.
Let's see what you're feeling right now.
yellow! 
That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.
You must be about to laugh or something.
It's probably just about to come out.
We'II wait.
We got all day.
Oh, my God. 
There it is! 
cool.
That ring really works. 
That's amazing.
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Look at this.
My sister sent it to me.
It was taken an hour ago at the philadelphia Zoo.
Mother of God, what kind of terrorists are these?
They're not sure it's terrorists now.
Moments ago. in an official statement.
the government moved away from its initial position that this was a terrorist attack.
Authorities are now feeling.
by the sheer number of incidents being reported.
that a terrorist group being responsible is becoming less and less likely.
The event appears to be limited to the Northeast.
where smaller and smaller towns are being attacked.
Where are we?
The infected area now includes most of New England.
from Massachusetts to Maryland.
We're dead center.
Everything okay?
If we stay here, we are gonna die here.
Whatever this is, it looks like it's not occurring about 90 miles from here.
Let's go.
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?
Hey!
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, could we get a ride, please?
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!
-We have a little girl with us. 
please.
-Drive. 
Just roll up the window.
Sir! 
You're not just going to...
Can you believe how crappy people are?
There's a car.
Hi. 
I run a plant nursery up the street.
We're picking up a few things from home, then heading wherever this isn't happening.
We have room.
-We have two others.
-That's okay.
julian!
Is julian okay?
We got a ride. 
He can fit all of us.
elliot, I can't get Evette on the phone or e-maiI or nothing.
-How long?
-It's been about two hours.
She was on that bus headed to Princeton.
There's a car over there headed to pick up friends and family, they said they could squeeze one more.
We got to go.
Look, think real carefully about this.
She was looking for a birthday present for Jess.
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.
I'm just gonna go get her and I want to bring her back, and then I'm gonna find you guys.
I just... 
I need you to take Jess, okay?
She's gonna be a Iot safer with you.
Don't do this to me.
I'm doing my best here not to fall down.
I'm sure the probability of Princeton not being hit is good.
Yeah.
You want me to throw some figures and percentages at you so we both feel better?
-please.
-AII right.
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.
-well, you go get her, jules, okay?
-Of course, man, of course.
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.
I have to go.
I got her, julian.
Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it.
I'm going to go get Mommy.
hold our picture.
Take a look around.
We'II be ready in a jiffy.
We're packing hot dogs for the road.
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.
They've got a cool shape, they've got protein.
You like hot dogs, right?
By the way, I think I know what's causing this.
-You do?
-It's the plants.
They can release chemicals.
You like hot dogs, don't you?
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going, but we will be back soon, okay?
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.
Did you get the mustard?
Don't look outside. 
Stop it!
Stop it! 
Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!
close the vents.
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.
What?
How much would you have if I said I would pay you a penny on the first day and then two pennies on the second, and then four pennies on the third day and I just kept doubling it and I did this for a month?
How much money would you have at the end of the month?
-Ten dollars.
-No, higher. 
Higher, higher.
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.
Twenty dollars?
No, keep going. 
Keep going.
Thirty. 
It's thirty. 
It's $30.
I'm gonna tell you the answer.
It's over $10 million.
You'd have over $10 million at the end of the month.
You want to hear another one?
Water contamination has surfaced as one of the many theories being taken seriously as to the cause of the events in the Northeast.
We have to go through this little community of homes.
small town called HoIcomb, then we hit the highway.
From there, we're 30 miles from the state line.
Are those dead animals up ahead?
Stop the car.
-You don't think it's...
-I don't know.
You got binoculars in the back, from when you were spying on our neighbors.
Can I have the map?
elliot...
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it wouId be bodies.
How could it not be bodies?
please, give me the map.
well, we have to turn around.
There's a right turn about a quarter of a mile back.
We're just gonna take a different route, honey, okay?
Oh, it's the Army. 
We're safe!
My name is Private Auster.
I'm stationed at West Dover military Base, about 10 miles back.
I think they've been affected by whatever's happening.
I lost communication with them.
When I approached the base,
I saw military personnel in the barbed wire, in the fence.
So I suggest no one take that road.
There's a town about eight miles behind us.
There were bodies on the road into town.
Cheese and crackers.
well, that still leaves us two directions.
Just stop! 
Stop the vehicle!
-What's going on?
-Is everyone all right?
We have no communication with anybody.
-I'II talk to them.
-Did you see anything out of the ordinary?
hello! 
please stop!
Excuse me.
Who's Joey?
Oh, it's no one.
Any luck?
I can't get julian on his cell phone.
I'm sure he'II be all right. 
They'II be okay.
Has anyone seen any other people on the roads?
Maybe he's on to something.
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.
Why did it start in parks?
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.
They say there's a bus in a lake.
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.
Okay.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.
There's a woman talking to her daughter.
She's talking to her daughter in Princeton.
Isn't that where your friend went?
Come on.
It's okay. 
Honey, it's okay.
She's so scared.
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.
Just keep watching out the window with the tree, baby.
Someone will come and get you soon.
tell her not to go near the window with the tree. 
Just tell her.
Baby, don't go near the window with the tree.
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.
Honey, someone wants to know if Princeton's had any problems.
She says everyone's dead outside.
You just stay in your room.
Honey?
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?
-What do you mean? 
Everyone's dead?
-What?
Stacy... 
Stacy, you're scaring me.
I don't understand what you're saying.
What, baby?
She's just not making any sense.
Calculus.
I see in calculus.
Calculus.
-Stacy!
Calculus.
Stacy!
Stacy Ann!
Oh, my God.
-I hear wind from outside.
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.
Oh, no!
We're going to go back to the car, okay, Jess?
If we went down that road, where would that take us?
I walked down a quarter mile, it was clean.
I can't tell you what's after that, but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.
-Quarter mile?
-That's not enough.
Hey, it's better than going back the other way.
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.
elliot's resilient, isn't he?
Yeah. 
He never gives up.
You know, plants have the ability to target specific threats.
Tobacco plants, when attacked by HeIiothis caterpillars will send out a chemical attracting wasps to kill just those caterpillars.
We don't know how plants attain these abilities.
They just evolve very rapidly.
Which species do you think is doing it if you think it's true?
plants have the ability to communicate with other species of plants.
Trees can communicate with bushes, bushes with grass and everything in between.
The radio says these attacks started happening in the cities then went to the towns and now the roads.
That's right.
Whatever's happening is happening to smaller and smaller populations.
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.
The terrorists, or whatever could be watching the roads.
I don't have any reason to disagree right now.
We are in the area of attack.
If you can't find a way through the area of attack we are told to find a safe zone within the area being attacked.
They're attacking populations.
We need to go where there aren't that many people.
Where people don't travel.
Now this is Mr. collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.
If we go west, we'II hit a county called ArundeII.
It's not on that map.
It would only be on local maps.
Dirt roads. 
hardly anybody lives out there.
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?
We should go into two groups.
Those that are ready to go right now and those that need to get things from their cars.
We need to stay in groups. 
Stay together.
We'II go soon, honey. 
We'II go soon.
Maybe we should've waited for the rest of them, stayed in a big group, Iike the Private said.
Your phone's out, too?
What's wrong?
Okay. 
I was going to tell you, okay?
There was this guy, Joey.
His name is Joey. 
He's at work.
We went out and we had dessert.
I went out and I had dessert with him when I told you I worked late.
And I didn't work late.
I'm feeling really guilty in case we're gonna die.
I just wanted you to know that.
You lied to me?
-How much farther is it?
-I don't know.
-We need to keep going forward.
-Who the hell made you boss?
Look, if y'aII follow him, y'aII gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!
Private Auster?
My firearm is my friend.
Jesus.
Oh, no.
What, "Oh, no"?
The toxin?
The toxin is affecting them?
Are those people killing themselves?
You were with the Private.
What do we do?
-We need to do something!
-Just let me think.
-They're dying!
-I need a second.
They released it? 
We're not near the roads.
We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers!
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!
We are not going to be one of those assholes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something!
-We're not assholes!
-Just a second!
There were children in that group!
-elliot, please tell us what to do.
-I need a second, okay!
Why can't anybody give me a goddamn second?
AII right, be scientific, douchebag.
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.
careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Interpret the experimental data. 
Interpret.
What if it is the plants?
Their group was larger than ours.
This thing has been escalating all day.
smaller and smaller populations have been setting this off.
They react to human stimulus.
Maybe people are setting off the plants?
What are you saying? 
That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.
They're already dead.
What if they're targeting us as threats?
This part of the field may not have been set off.
Something in this field could be releasing the chemical into the air when there's too many of us together.
Let's just stay ahead of the wind.
Let's just break up into groups.
Come on! 
Come on! 
This way!
Come on, follow me!
I'm right here! 
Keep going!
I'm right behind you!
Here it comes!
Don't you let go of my hand.
Nothing happened.
It's the size of the groups, I think.
could this really be happening?
What are your names?
-Jared.
-Josh.
Wait, wait!
I'm going to go see if that truck has a map.
You guys wait here.
Why aren't they looking into nuclear power plants?
There are 15 or more in the Northeast alone.
More than anywhere else in the United States.
There's probably been some leak or something.
It's probably poisoning the air.
There's a house over there! 
Come on!
It could have been some terrorist booby-trap, someone stepped on it out in the field.
Yeah, in a field in BumbIetown, pennsylvania.
I don't know.
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.
The source had to be close to that field, if not in the field.
Here's one.
plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.
You think it could be plants?
I don't know.
But if it is, and people are setting it off in groups, we need to go to the least populated place we can to be safe.
We can't walk to the borders where this isn't happening, alma. 
It's too far.
Whatever it is, terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants, it's probably safe to get away from people right now.
That must be ArundeII.
It's 10 miles from here.
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.
Hurry.
hello?
My name is EIIiot Moore.
I'm just going to talk in a very positive manner.
Giving off good vibes.
We're just here to use the bathroom and then we're just gonna leave.
I hope that's okay.
plastic.
I'm talking to a plastic plant.
I'm still doing it.
You guys ready to leave?
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?
Hey, everything's fake.
Why is this happening?
I don't know for sure, Josh.
But I read this article about the coast of australia.
It said they found large quantities of a primordial bacteria.
It hadn't been around for billions of years, it just appeared in the water.
It's toxic to humans, fishermen who come in contact with it are dying.
It feels kind of similar to that.
With the bees disappearing, I mean, I don't know, it feels like a pattern.
The nature of events like the one in australia is that they crest and then stop.
We just have to be alive when it's over.
I don't believe it's nature.
It may not be. 
There could be some other explanation. 
I don't know.
Let's go.
There are people coming!
We can't stay here. 
It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.
There's two groups coming together.
There's too many of them together.
Run. 
Run.
-Is she your kid?
-No.
-You got kids?
-No.
How come? 
You got a problem?
No. 
She wanted to wait.
really? 
For what?
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?
Sweet. 
I used to love those. 
Can I see it?
You need to take personal responsibility for yourself in a relationship.
-That'II make a difference.
-Okay. 
Thank you.
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.
-elliot! 
Look!
-Come on.
Oh, wow.
...is an emergency broadcast.
All those who are still inside the affected area of the Northeast are asked to proceed to the police borders west of your state.
Come on.
This is an emergency broadcast.
...inside the affected area...
Jess needs a 10-minute rest and some food.
Are you sure? 
We should keep going.
I know, but she's only eight.
What?
If we're going to die, I want you to know something.
I was in the pharmacy a while ago, and there was a really good-Iooking pharmacist behind the counter.
really good-Iooking.
And I went up and I asked her where the cough syrup was.
I didn't even have a cough.
And I almost bought it.
And I'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup.
That's like six bucks.
Are you joking?
Thank you.
-Maybe that's not a good idea.
-I told her just for a minute.
Mr. Moore, I think I can open this door.
Wait. 
We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?
-Come on, guys.
-Listen, nobody's home.
We're just gonna get some food for Jess.
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's lived here for a Iong time anyway.
I mean, it's all boarded up.
Maybe we could leave some money.
-What kind of tree is this?
-I think it's a maple.
Not so high.
Okay, Josh, open the door.
Wait!
I see something.
-There's somebody in there!
-You sure?
Yeah, I saw him move.
I see him !
Let's stop.
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.
-We just want to get her some food.
-You best leave now.
You ain't gonna bring that poison gas in here with you.
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.
-They said to stay inside.
-We're fine right now.
Nothing's happened out here yet.
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.
We're perfectly normal.
Old black water. keep on rolling
Mississippi moon Won't you keep on shining on me?
See? 
We're normal.
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.
Okay. 
It's not worth it.
Open the door, bitch!
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!
-There's more than one in there.
-Jess! 
Jess, come here.
Stop it, Jess. 
Listen, we just want some food for a little girl, you pussies!
-Jess, come here.
-Josh, stop it.
You'd best not let that gas in here.
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.
-You might be with the terrorists!
-I don't think it's terrorists, sir.
-Josh, stop it!
-They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!
-Show your faces!
-Let the gas in...
No!
Jared!
We're gonna get out of this nightmare.
elliot!
We have to go. 
We have to protect Jess.
Okay?
You've got to three to get off our porch!
Come here.
No new people have crossed over the border for a few hours.
It appears those residents that are still in the affected area of the Northeast are trying to wait it out.
We have Professor Kendel Wallace of Carnegie Mellon.
a statistician. here with us.
Professor. what can you tell us?
Calculating by the rise in intensity of reports of incidents within the affected area.
one can guess at a crude timetable.
One can see the incident is rising in sensitivity.
We've seen fewer and fewer people can provoke the attacks.
The event should be at its most sensitive tomorrow morning.
Typically. these type of slopes drop precipitously after cresting.
meaning it could end suddenly.
at any moment.
Of course. these are only probabilities.
There are some quiet rumblings that the government may be involved in the tragic events playing out in the Northeast.
Now. these rumors have been fuelled by the statements of a confidential informant who claims that the ClA has facilities in the Northeast.
where they are testing drugs with some similar psychotropic properties as a defense against chemical weapons.
cia and White House officials have declined to respond to these accusations.
Perimeters have been set up all along the East Coast from Maryland all the way to Massachusetts.
This house has no power going to it.
Nobody's driven on this driveway for a Iong time, either.
Let me go. 
You guys stay right here.
That's for CIement.
He's a retriever.
You lost?
You must be.
There ain't nothing around here for miles.
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?
I suppose the kind thing for me to do is to offer you supper.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
I hope the meal was sufficient.
I wasn't expecting guests.
This is a beautiful place.
There's a springhouse in the back.
They used to hide people from slave chasers back there.
It has a speaking tube running under the ground to the main house.
You can hear each other like you were in the same room.
So, what's with you two?
Who's chasing who?
I'm sorry?
Ain't no time two people staring at each other, standing still,
Iove in both their eyes, at the same time, equal.
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.
That's the way we's built.
So?
Who's chasing?
I knew that. 
I knew that.
Don't touch things that aren't yours.
-Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
-No.
I got enough to fill my time right here.
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.
although I ain't got the touch.
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.
-How do you stay in contact with others?
-I don't.
How would you know if something were to happen? 
Like a world event?
Mrs. Jones, something's happened along the East Coast.
Whatever it is that you think is so important that you need to tell me, don't.
Just keep it to yourself.
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.
Suppose I have to let you spend the night.
Guest room's up on the Ieft.
Mind the steps.
I'm scared, elliot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. 
I was being stupid.
You've been great taking care of Jess.
I don't like this woman.
There's something Exorcisty about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?
well, we need to stay in this house.
You want me to protect you, this is how we have to do it.
Let's just deal with her.
I hear you whispering.
planning on stealing something?
No, ma'am, we're not.
plan on murdering me in my sleep?
What? 
No!
Mrs. Jones?
Mrs. Jones?
Crazy lady.
You trying to steal my things?
No! 
No, Mrs. Jones, I actually wanted to talk with you.
-You all are gonna leave right now!
-Ma'am, you don't understand.
There's something happening in a few states, in this region.
-It's not safe!
-Leave now!
The Lord is my shepherd.
The Lord is my shepherd.
Mrs. Jones, could we talk calmly for a second?
Just hear me out. 
See, I'm a teacher...
Mrs. Jones?
Oh, my God.
alma, shut the windows and the doors!
alma?
alma?
alma?
Jess?
Hi, froggie! 
Hi, froggie!
Okay, yeah. 
Wait.
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? 
I think he's a baby.
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.
Oh, he got water on my shoe.
Isn't this a cool house?
If we had this house, we could make it look so pretty.
Get him again. 
Get him again.
Hey, froggie.
alma?
Good morning, elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.
-close the windows and the doors, alma.
-Why?
Mrs. Jones just died. 
close the windows.
close the door, Jess!
-Is everything closed?
-Yes.
-I'm sorry, alma.
-What's going on, elliot?
It's happening here.
It could be the grass and the trees are doing this now.
She was alone when it happened.
Seems like they might have gotten more sensitive.
It's too dangerous to go outside, isn't it?
Yes.
This is the end, isn't it?
I wish you were here.
Me, too.
You remember our first date?
You were so quiet.
You bought me the mood ring.
It turned purple when you wore it.
Then you said, "That means you're in love."
It got you to talk, didn't it?
Then we checked the little paper chart, and it turned out that purple meant I was horny.
-You loved that.
-I had no idea.
Yours was blue. 
peaceful, right?
Right.
What color was love?
I don't remember.
Me, neither.
elliot?
Yeah?
I was just making sure you're there.
It's not right for it to end like this.
If we're gonna die, I want to be with you.
I want to be with you, and I'm gonna come and be with you.
elliot, don't!
The event must have ended before we went out there.
I found the hair clip!
You don't want to be late for the first day schools are open.
Oh, wait.
I'm just gonna put this right here.
Okay?
-Are you okay?
-Yes, Aunt alma. 
I Iove you.
I Iove you, too. 
Come here.
AII right. 
I'II pick you up after you're done with school, okay?
Bye.
As everyone knows by now.
traces of the neurotoxin have been found in some plants and trees.
Now. most environmentalists feel that this event is like the red tide in the ocean.
but instead of algae killing fish.
this happened on land.
Now. plants and trees just can't pick up and move when they feel threatened.
like other species.
They have only one option.
to rapidly evolve their chemistry.
Well.
Kay from Mississippi wants to know why it started so suddenly.
on a Tuesday at 8.:33 and then ended so suddenly at 9.:27 the next morning.
Well. 
Kay. to be perfectly honest.
this was an act of nature.
and we'll never fully understand it.
And. 
Doctor. there's been a lot of speculation as to why this happened in the Northeast only.
How do you explain that?
Well. I believe. all right.
and this is just my opinion.
that this was a prelude. okay?
A warning. like the first spot of a rash.
We have become a threat to this planet.
I don't think anybody will argue that.
And this is a warning.
A warning?
I think the skeptics would believe that if it had occurred anywhere else.
That's why most people believe it was the government.
If it had happened in one other place.
anywhere else.
we could all believe what you're saying.
I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work.
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?
I should drop my bicycle off at the apartment before I go to work.
That frightened me.
I should drop my bicycle off
What?
My God...
My bicycle.

Til Death Season 3 Episode 2
"'til death" is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
3 feet,2 feet,1 fo.
You're good.
This door won't open.
OK, just push right below the handle there.
Below the handle. 
You got to push and pull at the same time.
How's a man supposed to push and pull at the same time?
I might as well be doing nothing.
All right,look. 
You know,let me get it.
You know what?
A lot of you is in my no-dude zone.
You know what?
I'm going out "dukes of hazzard" style.
Let me do this.
All right,easy.
I got this.
That is not as easy as it looks on television.
Well,she's back.
The car that bought me a boat.
- Yeah. 
How you doing,sid?
- Good.
What's wrong with her this time,eddie?
What isn't wrong with her?
The dome lights flicker and the door is stuck,
And when i push her past 42 there is a noise in the engine. 
It sounds like a monkey violating a squirrel.
What about the brakes?
What's wrong with the brakes?
What's wrong with the brakes?
They don't stop the car.
All right. 
Give me about 4 hours.
Check it out. 
I put a doughnut hole into a dounut.
See? 
This is what the doughnut looked like before man got involved.
I can't hear a word you're saying right now. 
I'm riding a pretty big sugar buzz.
You fellas interested in checking this baby out?
She's a beautiful automobile.
Yeah. 
Well,we're here for the doughnut holes,
So you can save your seductively minty breath.
No problem, you're probably looking for something more conservative anyway.
Conservative?
This man turned me on to barack obama.
Keep your pants on,kenny.
See,she thinks if she can make me feel not hip that i'll buy the car to prove that i am.
No, no, wait a minute. 
My job is to sell you a car that suits your lifestyle,
So let's start from there.
How old are you? 
About 60?
I'll take it!
I know it would be cheaper to buy a whole new dryer, but i have to talk to my husband first.
We always consult each other on big purchases.
Look,buddy,your little sales tricks aren't gonna work on this family, ok?
We're practical,and we're hardworking,
And we spend our money wisely.
Ok. 
Thank you.
There she is.
How'd it go getting your car fixed?
Not-Not good.
Not good at all.
No, we've... problems,joy,with the spark plugs, the brake pads,flux capacitator.
I think we have to start thinking about-
I don't know,buying a new car.
Yeah,no.
Wh-Why not?
Well, you must mind behind getting a new dryer because ours is broken,
And if i have to hang your pants out to dry, there will be a total eclipse.
If we get a new car, then you're gonna have to sell your old car,
And remember when we tried to sell our vcr?
That weird guy stole our toilet seat and climbed out the window.
Yeah,but come on,honey.
I mean,loosen up.
It's just money. 
Ain't no pockets in heaven,you know?
Les go buy a new dryer or a car!
What is with you? 
Last week you punch the wall because i bought pre-cut pineapple.
Honey,you know that i love you and I want you to be happy,
And there will come a time when you can get a new car, but it's not now.
Actually,it is now.
I can't believe you bought this without asking me.
Well,i didn't officially ask you, but we discussed it.
When?
Two minutes ago in the kitchen
You already bought the car.
You know,it just sounds like someone's in the mood for a fight,so..
Seriously,eddie, a red sport car.
This is a classic midlife crisis.
Why don't you get your ear pierced and marry calista flockhart?
Just because i bought a red convertible and i happen to be in the middle of my life does not mean i'm having a midlife crisis.
Joy,honey,come on. 
Check out this high-tech dashboard.
I had it customized with all the bells and whistles.
I got the gps, the triple start, the bluetooth
And for an extra 7.50 a month, you can wi-fi your mypage space.
It's myspace page,grandpa.
Hey,you know what else?
You can actually email photos right from the dashboard.
You know what else you can email from the dashboard?
A cry for help.
- Eddie,can you even fit in this thing?
- Like a glove.
Teacher's face have a smile, maybe you get a ride.
Relax!
A red convertible?
Right? 
It's insulting.
It's worse than insulting.
It's a hostile act on his part.
All he thinks about is that stupid car.
The only time he's touched me in the last week, he ran his hand down my arm and said,
"My seats are softer than your skin".
My fourth husband d this exact same thing. 
Here's what you do.
This is good. 
This is why I come to you.
Slash his tires.
Excuse me?
Go in the kitchen,get the biggest butcher knife you can find,
And shred the living hell out of those tires.
Are there leather seats?
Yeah- Listen to me.
After you do the tires, take the knife and you bury it in the driver's side headrest like a colombian drug lord.
Joy, I've trying work out the numbers for that caribbean cruise package we've been working on.
I've got the event coordinator on the line.
You know,the one you call horse-face heidi?
Stu,you're still wearing your headset.
Stupid phone from the future!
Come on! 
Get your head in the game,brah!
Who let them dogs out?
woof woof woof woof who let them dogs out?
woof woof woof woof
You know,the real question is, who let you out?
Did you just roller-skate 17 miles to my house?
Yeah.My ex-wife took my ride,so i'm kind of in between cars right now.
But it's all good.
He also need some fresh air anyway.
So..
i took my dog out woof woof woof woof look my dog out woof woof woof woof who took my dog out?
Skates needs new wheels, man, and i was skating by the dealership this morning,man.
I noticed your car was on the market again.
What are you asking? 
If you can buy my old car? 
Go for it.
- You sure you don't mind?
- Why would i mind?
You guys were together a long time,man.
And we're friends,you know what i'm saying?
I don't want to move in on your old hoopty,man,
And then there's some kind of weirdness going on between a you.
Well,trust me. 
If there's any weirdness going on, it's because you're wearing a chihuahua.
All right. 
So we're cool,right?
We're cool.
Oh,crap.
The crows are back!
Get away!
You should have seen him with his short shorts and his slopest sponges, I felt like i was watching an old "Wham!" video.
Here's what you do.
You get your own soap and your own sponges, and then you find a latin man with a ponytail and ride him like a dirt bike.
Did they do a background check on you?
Well,you better do something to turn his head, or the next thing you know, a private detective will be showing you 8x10 glossies of that car pulling into a motel with a 20-year-old yoga instructor who's dying to teach him downward dog.
You're right,but what am i gonna do? 
Start dating someone?
I mean,do i literally have to parade a guy in front of his face to get his attention?
- Hey, Stu, how's going?
- Uh,super not good.
I was trying to photocopy my face for a party invite. 
I forgot to close my eyes.
Well,i hope that party's not tomorrow night,
Because i just got off the phone with corporate, and they are anxious for us to finish that cruise package.
Oh,damn it!
Being an executive is so hard.
I should have joined the army, there will be home now.
Yeah, I'm not happy about it either, but here's an idea.
We don't have to finish it here at the office. 
Maybe we could do it at my place.
Your place?
Yeah.
It'll be totally cas'-
You know, wear some tight pants and a tight little shirt and shave your chest.
I don't know. 
Whatever.
mr.Stark?
Who's that? 
Who's talking?
This is judy from Tripstar. 
I see your car alarm has been activated. 
Is everything ok?
Uh,i don't know. 
How poisonous is wiper fluid?
Just try to calm down and tell me what's happening.
Ok. 
Well, I was going to Winky Mart to pick up some orange juice,
And the car tried to kill me. 
That's what's happening.
Ok,i'm just gonna need you to hit the reset button.
- Oh,god.
- what is it?
i think i accidentally activated my seat heater.
It's ok,mr.Stark. I'm gonna reset your on-board computer right now.
Ok. 
Well, please hurry.
It's roasting my kielbasa!
That's too much information,sir.
All right, listen. 
You gotta help me, Judy.
Please don't let me die at Winky Mart.
God bless you, judy from tripstar.
Wassup,playa?
Remember your old car?
You pimped my ride.
She's beautiful.
What do you got going on there? 
Dragons?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 
I should have thought of that.
Those spinning hubcaps are cool.
Looks like the car's moving when it's not.
I like that.
- So do we.
- We?
Eddie,you know marla. 
She lives down the street from you.
Yes. 
I think we had a moment the other day when I was washing my car.
This ring a bell?
I remember that car.
You will never guess what marla named her dog.
Jay-Z.
Look at that. 
Beyonce and jay-Z.
It's a doggie date.
Listen, marla, if you ever want to take a spin In the roadster, you know where I live.
Yeah,that's ok. 
I know what it's like.
My mom has one.
Well,she must be a very cool lady.
She's ok.
Ok. 
We're rolling,man. 
Be good.
It was nice meeting you,sir.
Oh,god.
Engage roof. 
Engage roof!
Come on,roof!
Come on. 
Come on!
It's got my hair! 
It's got my hair.
Judy. 
Judy!
Can i go home now? 
My brain is full.
No. 
I think we should go over this itinerary one more time.
Oh,man. 
My dog is so pooping in my kitchen right now.
You're right. 
We're done.
But before you go..
Let's celebrate.
Here you go.
Here is to a long,hard week.
Stu,you are so funny.
What do i do?
Oh,hey,eddie,i didn't expect you home so soon.
Stu and I were,um,we were just doing a little work.
Joy,can i talk to you for a minute,please?
Excuse me,Stu.
Listen,i'm-I'm sorry i've been acting like such an ass these last couple of days.
- Yes,you have.
- Sit down.
You know, sometimes in life, the thing you love the most,you take for granted,
And i guess what i'm trying to say is, I never really appreciated my old car.
Eddie,look around you.
Romantic lighting and wine and another man.
I mean,don't you see what is going on here?
Not really.
I'm kind of lost,too.
Doesn't it look like someone is having an affair?
- What?
- What?
Not a real affair.
I staged all this and i used Stu to make it look like I was having an affair.
Wait. 
So none of this is real?
You mean the last 8 weeks of my life have been a charade?
The interview, the computer, the awesome desk.
No, Stu. 
The job is real.
I'm just talking about the last 90 minutes.
Don't you see what you are doing to me?
What did i do?
Ever since you bought that stupid car, it's as if i am invisible!
But i guess that's something that I'm gonna have to get used to for the rest of my life-
You getting shiny new objects because you don't want to focus on your boring, old wife.
So do i show up to work tomorrow,or-
Yes,Stu,you will come to work tomorrow.
I'm sorry about this.
See you tomorrow.
- Can i get my laptop?
- No.
All right. 
Listen, honey, i'm sorry all this happened.
You know,it's not fun feeling like you can be replaced by a car.
All right,listen,joy.
Look at me. 
Look at me.
I am so lucky to have you.
You are the most beautiful,passionate,smartest lady in the world,
And there's not a car out there that can ever replace you.
Certainly not one in my price range.
This all you needed to to say.
Is that so hard?
I'm sorry that you missed your car.
Yeah, sorry...
You know, what to done is done, ah?
- No, get take it for the last spin.
- How is there?
You never get Kenny the extra key.
It's feels good to be back.
Don't you think we should talk Kenny what we did, ah?
Yeah...
Sorry, I'll have it back before even he know it's gone.
Want to stop over, or you want be on the news?

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John go do My will!"
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down

The G.P.S. says it's right up here.
You don't even know how to use that thing.
The hell I don't.
- We're here.
- We just drove an hour through the woods... to find more woods that lookjust like the woods we drove through.
- Eureka.
- Ew!
- That's mud.
- No. 
This is, like, um- 
- Yeah, it's pretty much mud.
- It smells like rotten egg.
Mmm. 
Sulfur.
Very therapeutic.
And you expect me to believe you've never been here before.
A friend of mine told me about this place and swore me to secrecy... but this is my first time- in mud.
Come on in. 
It's nice.
All right.
Mmm.
Something's poking me.
This mud is reputed to have amazing romantic properties.
Mmm. 
I think I got it.
No, I think I'd notice ifyou got it.
Whoa. 
Sheesh.
This hot spring averages a temperature of 105 degrees... but it can spike to near boiling, which is whywe discourage bathers... especially those who illegally drive 4x4 vehicles into a national park.
- So someone was boiled to death?
- Or had a heart attack or passed out, et cetera, et cetera.
The remaining flesh will have to be macerated.
- What's that?
- Uh, don't ask.
The flesh either has to be boiled off or eaten by dermestid beetles.
Bones, whycan'tyou justsay "cleaned'"?
The sulfur encrusted the bone.
You see the staining?
- So it's been there a long time?
- Not necessarily.
- So why do you have to even bring it up then?
- Signs ofblunt-force trauma.
- What's that mean?
- That means he didn't pass out and boil to death on his own.
- I'm going to need all ofthe mud.
- Excuse me?
Get a tanker truck out here and suck it up so we can filter it back at theJeffersonian.
Humerus is 36.5 centimeters.
Medium build. 
Late 20s, early 30s.
He's broken this bone before.
- Is she serious about the mud?
- Serious as a gas attack.
"Heart attack,"' Bones.
Serious as a heart attack.
The description's too general to get anything from a Missing Persons report.
Triangular depression in the calvarium, interior longitudinal 1 fracture... grazed cortical bone in C1.
There's a patterned impression in the bone.
Howmanytimes was he hit?
Andbywhat?
More than once- by a square pipe.
Does that exist?
In my experience, people hit people with anything they can pick up and swing.
- He was attacked from behind?
- Mmm- 
- What?
- There's a vertical impaction fracture... to his glabella and fronto-nasal suture.
- Same weapon?
- It doesn't appear so.
- I have seen this before.
- Really? 
Great. 
Where?
From sharpened stone weapons in "Neandertal" skeletons.
I'm thinking not so relevant in this case.
The blow to the front ofthe head would cause a severe laceration.
There were no bloodstains around the mud bath.
Indicating the bodywas dumped there postmortem.
- Jack, regarding the Neanderthals- 
- Neandertals.
What was the context ofthose killings?
Accepted scenarios indicate a single individual attacked by two or more assailants.
Then we're looking for two or more murderers.
We're notsure about time ofdeathyet.
- It was definitely a murder.
- Definitely. 
Probably by two assailants.
What a shock forthat couple, huh?
They slide naked into the hot mud bath...
- and a skeleton hand pokes her in the, you know- 
- Anus.
- Bones!
- What? 
It's a clinical term for that part ofthe body, Booth.
Dr. Brennan.
Agent Booth.
Would it be fair to say that you use work... to avoid confronting personal issues?
Why? 
Because I don't want to talk about- 
- The anus.
- You really like that word, don'tyou?
Doyou two ever discuss anything that's not attached to work?
- Well, it's better than talking about, you know- 
- The anus?
- What is it with you two?
- Sweets could be right. 
We talk a lot about work.
- I talk about my kid.
- Because he was almost kidnapped during a case.
Uh, my father.
We talk about him.
Because Agent Booth arrested him for murder.
Okay. 
What areyou trying to get at here?
Your inability to shareyour personal lives.
I thought that was obvious.
Okay, that was snotty.
I don't respond well to snotty.
After a case, sometimes... we have a drink or coffee.
Booth has pie.
I don't like pie.
You really should just give it a chance.
- I find it too sweet.
- Okay. 
There. 
We talked about pie.
Nothing to do with work.
It is betterwhen we discuss murder.
I'dlike to seeyou guys in a socialsituation.
A situation where work is a taboo subject.
Gonna send us to a restaurant and watch through a one-way mirror?
- I'm still not having pie.
- No. 
An evening out with my girlfriend and me.
They need someone to buy them beer.
You want us to go on a double date?
Why don'tyou just go on the Internet like all the rest ofthe kids?
Okay. 
Ifit goes well, I'll withdraw my concern.
I'll releaseyou back intoyour environment.
What are we, brook trout?
Fine.
Agent Booth?
Unless you think that's too much to prove.
Fine. 
I'll show him I have nothing to prove.
Bring it on, Sweets.
So far, I have three old beer cans... an Indian arrowhead... 73 cents in change... and a partially melted Sharpie.
The victim was braised like osso buco.
The flesh was falling offthe bone.
I'd put time of death between 10 days and two weeks.
I found stress fractures and degenerative changes in the facet joints.
Fits with the hypertrophy ofthe cervical muscles.
I found microscopic tearing, but he had to sustain this position...
- to cause that kind ofwear and tear.
- Death byyoga?
Is that skull ready for meyet?
It should be ready.
You can take it out ofthe boiler anytime.
Oryou could do that for me because I will never, ever do that.
There are fractures ofthe pelvis, compression fractures ofthoracic and lumbarvertebrae... multiple metacarpal and metatarsal fractures.
What was he?
Crash test dummy?
The injuries to the vertebrae, tibia, femur... are consistent with landing on the feet after falling from 10 to 20 feet.
What? 
Like jumping out of a tree?
The damage to the scapula andacromion resulted from a low fall... but forward movement from between 16 to 20 miles per hour.
- Falling off a bicycle.
- These injuries are more recent.
Fractured and scored patella and torn retinaculum.
- Even I didn't get that one.
- Whywould anyone want to kill him?
Sounds like he was doing a good enough job on his own.
Yes. 
Okay, Dr. Sweets. 
I'llask him.
How's Wednesday night?
Are you free?
Oh, what? 
To have our big double date with our psychiatrist?
J ust one more evening and then maybe we won't have to see him anymore.
Fine. 
Wednesday's fine.
I can't wait.
- Does he want me to getyou a corsage?
- Yeah, Wednesday is fine.
We'll meetyou there.
Yeah. 
I'm looking forward to meeting her.
Okay. 
Bye.
This might be fun.
His girlfriend works with tropical fish.
- Tropical fish?
- Yeah.
- This is just weird. 
Where are we meeting?
- At their ceramics class.
- What? 
No. 
You're kidding.
- Whywould I be kidding?
He said itwas a good idea to have a common activity.
Ceramics? 
I thought the whole point oftherapy... was to give us peace ofmind, not drive us crazy.
Hey, it's Angela.
- Hey, Angela.
- Hey.
I did a rendering of our victim's face.
- We're checking him against any reports of missing persons.
- Wait a second.
- That's Tripp Goddard.
- Tripp Goddard?
He's a motorcycle racer.
Oh, I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls.
That wouldexplain the wrist and neck injuries on Zack's report.
Have him confirm with dentals.
Yeah, I don't appreciate the "girls" comment.
Uh, Tripp won a huge motorcycle race about two weeks ago.
- That fits time of death.
- That would've been the Super Grand Prix, out in Virginia.
Tripp won in the final two laps after some kind of accident took out the front-runner.
Girls, huh?
It's not about the machine. 
It's about the man.
Sure, you need a great bike, but a great rider on a crap bike is still gonna win.
Riders say it's about the rider. 
Mechanics say it's the machine. 
You know what I say?
- It's about whoeversigns the paychecks.
- Ah, yes. 
And that would be you.
- Yes, it would, and don't forget it.
- Excuse me.
F.B.I. Special Agent Booth. 
This here's Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian.
We're looking for someone who might be able to tell us a little bit about Tripp Goddard.
Uh, well, I'm Philippa Fitz, and Tripp rides for ourfamilyteam-
Slam Bolt.
- What did Tripp do?
- Who areyou?
Garth Jodrey.
I'm a journalist.
- Motokneescrapers. com.
- What does that mean?
Racers, when they lean real low into the corners, their knees- they scrape the asphalt.
That would explain his knee injuries.
- No one has seen Tripp since after the Super Grand Prix.
- Where did he go?
After a big win, he usually takes offing his truck and climbs mountains, swims oceans.
No one really knows for sure.
Can I helpyou?
Mr. Goddard's dead.
What? 
What happened?
We believe he was murdered.
Who would kill Tripp?
I don't know.
Well, the fans loved him.
- Everybody else hated him.
- Get lost, Garth.
- Daddy, please.
- No. 
I want him out ofhere, Philippa.
Garth doesn't seem to think Tripp was a good old boy, and you do.
- He's got his reasons.
- The wheelchair, for one.
- Tripp put him in that wheelchair?
- It was an accident.
During a race a couple ofyears ago.
You can't honestly believe that Garth had anything to do with this. 
How? 
He's in a wheelchair.
- With help obviously.
- When was the last timeyou saw Tripp?
The victory party after the race.
I saw him get in his truck and leave around midnight.
Great. 
I'm gonna need to know the make... the model, theyear, license plate ofthe truck.
Anything you need, we're here.
Just find the bastard who did this to him.
Yeah!
Okay. 
That's Danny Fitz.
I would've loved to have decked Tripp like that after our race.
- Only I was in a coma for a few days.
- Another Fitz?
Yeah. 
Lenny's son.
Philippa's twin brother.
All right. 
Watch this.
Danny's got the race in the bag.
Final lap. 
Tripp does that.
Classic inside-out block pass.
- Is he allowed to do that?
- Only if it's an accident.
Slam Bolt would've taken first and second against Flame Spark... ifTripp hadn't have clipped Danny.
There's someone named Flame Spark?
Yeah. 
Flame Spark spark plugs.
It's Slam Bolt's rival team.
Isawa little daylight. 
Lookedlike Danny was gonna go wide, so I went forit.
It is a bummerwhen somebody loses the front of their bike, but, um, what are you gonna do?
Danny had that race in the bag.
Tripp did the same thing toyou, didn't he?
Yeah.
Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn anything from the time he did it to me.
Danny Fitz-was he at thevictory party?
Yeah, absolutely.
Brave face for the press.
Did Danny leave before or afterTripp?
About the same time.
- How about you?
- I took off right after.
You're good friends with Danny, aren't you?
You mean are we good enough friends to kill Tripp together?
You know, I'm pretty sure I don't have to say anything without a lawyer.
- It's not going to work.
- What?
Dropping loud pieces of metal to hurry me up.
I need the skull so I can compare tool marks to potential murderweapons.
You're just gonna have to wait.
Titanium, magnesium and heat-treated boron particulates... are embedded in these skull fractures.
- Hmm.
- What?
That's a unique and exotic combination of metals not found in any ofthese.
You know, it is possible that these particulates aren't from the tool.
- I mean, not from the tool alone.
- I don't understand.
Handmade racing motorcycles are made from these metals.
So the particles could have gone from the bicycles to the tools to the victim.
It's-It's not a bicycle.
It's a motorcycle.
Bicycle- two wheels.
The term applies.
Drop those.
Drop them. 
I mean it, Zack.
Bombs away.
- I don't know what that proves.
- Proves I don't handle irritation as well as I'd like.
- Can I pick these up now?
- No.
You can pick one up- the most likely culprit.
A narrow instrument, no more than an inch, caused the injuries.
Okay.
Strain- the crushing, tearing, shearing- equals the change in dimension divided bythe original dimension.
I do bugs and slime.
I don't do arithmetic.
An elongated rod with... this cross-section is the most likely culprit.
Good. 
Good job, Zack.
Am I king ofthe lab?
We both are.
Let's go tell Cam.
Ouch.
Okay. 
Now that
- That's gotta hurt.
Wait. 
Here it comes again.
I mean, look at that.
Oh. 
Watch it.
Watch out. 
Watch out. 
Oh! 
Boom!
Let the record show that Agent Booth is taunting my client... by repeatedly showing footage ofhis traumatic accident.
Don't say "accident,"' man.
Tripp did that to me on purpose.
How fast wereyou going at the time ofyour incident?
I don't know exactly.
I was accelerating through 160.
Tripp was accelerating faster.
See there? 
Whoosh.
- Again with taunting.
- Whywas Tripp so much better than you?
- Taunting.
- I'm not taunting, Mr. Smalls.
I'm restating an objective fact.
Tripp had a better bike.
He had maybe 20 horses on me.
Soyou get Tripp's bike now.
Right, Mr. Fitz?
- I didn't kill Tripp for his motorcycle.
- Why did you kill him?
Whoa. 
Full stop there, cowboy.
Don't sweat it there, princess. 
Any other reason whyyou'd want to get rid ofTripp?
- No.
- Danny.
Certain things you hide make you look guilty.
Couple years back, Tripp was going out with my sister.
- Cheated on herwith a groupie.
- Came to blows.
- Who won?
- I did, for once.
- Knocked him on his ass.
- And you defended her honor.
Dannyand Philippa are twins, Agent Booth. 
They're very close.
Cheated on your sister, forced you to crash.
How would you exactly describe your relationship?
- We were the best of friends.
- Asyourlawyer...
I must caution you that sarcasm doesn't show up in the transcript.
- Best be avoided.
- Look. 
I'm sorryTripp's dead, but I'm not exactly grieving.
- You feel me?
- Bones, he's not afraid of me at all.
Well, it's hard to scare someone who rides around a track at 200 miles an hour.
Now her I like.
You want to go out sometime?
Danny, restrainyourself.
- No, she doesn't want to go out with you.
- Let me speak for myself.
Murder suspect here, Bones.
- The wound at the front of the head or the back?
- Back.
- It couldn't be both?
- No.
The blow to the front of the head was from a sharp tool.
- Sharper than round but blunter than sharp.
- What?
That actually made sense to me.
You two have been spending way too much time together.
Can you estimate the amount offorce?
In the back ofthe head, length undetermined... a width of3.8 centimeters, approximatelya thousandpounds offorce.
- So, a lot.
- Half a ton.
- Which is a lot.
- That actually isn't very much.
All right. 
Now I'm back in a physics class I want to ditch.
A boxer's fist can land with double that force.
- A big, meaty fist in a glove.
- Yeah. 
With a force spread out... over a hell of a lot more than 3.8 centimeters.
Correct. 
It wouldn't take all that much force to crush a skull with this.
So we haven't eliminated anyone from our list ofsuspects.
Plus we don't know what that's a cross-section of... and we don't know what caused the damage to the front of the face.
What exactly made you two come in here crowing, "king of the lab"?
I'm gonna go back and look at very small things under myvery large microscope.
I can probably identify the type oftool offthis cross-section.
Do it and call Booth.
See ifit's any use to him.
- Boys.
- Wow.
I don't have the weapon, but...
I microwaved the fabric samples and used gas sensors to analyze-
All right. 
All right. 
Let's just cut to the chase there, okay, Mr. Wizard?
I have identified what was on the victim's clothing.
- Fine. 
I'll take anything at this moment.
- What is it?
It's toluene. 
It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil.
How is that supposed to help us?
Every mechanic in theworld uses that stuff.
I needa weapon. 
Doyou hearme?
A weapon.
You know, I'm feeling really underappreciated today.
You know what?
You can suck it up, Buttercup.
- Booth?
- Huh?
- Toluene.
- It's also excellent for cleaning up blood.
So, ifyou killedsomeone here and they bled a lot-
The drain. 
Hey.
Check this drain for blood.
Blood suspended in toluene might be testable for D.N.A.
- Tell Hodgins he dida goodjob.
- I'll tell Hodgins he did a good job if-
I'm waiting.
I hate when you do this.
- Do what?
- You don't talk.
Sometimes you hate when I talk.
So it's a double-edged sword.
- Bones doesn't mind sitting in silence, doyou?
- Mm-mmm.
- I hate it.
- Why doyou think that is?
- He gets bored.
- You're right. 
I get bored.
You should see him on stakeouts.
He talks and talks.
Well, it's very interesting.
- Is it always about work?
- No.
You're lying.
Oh, come on.
How doyou know that?
I have special training in how to tell when people are lying.
- Is that true?
- See, ifyou were me, you'd know.
You're lying to protectyour partner.
I understand that.
But let's agree amongst ourselves that this is a truth zone.
Is something bothering you?
It's this whole "going on a date'"thing.
- No, it's not a date.
- It's not a date. 
It's a social outing... for the purpose of professional evaluation.
Come on. 
Ceramics?
I'm not that kind of a guy. 
All right?
What do we saywe go,you know, bowling, orto a firing range?
- Or climbing a wall.
- Oh. 
Right. 
Something you're good at.
A movie. 
Right?
Or dinner. 
Dinner and movie.
Somewhere that I don't have to make something.
Ooh.
What? 
What "ooh"?
Well, what Sweets would do in this situation is he'd jump on word usage.
He's going to askyou whyyou're resistant to "making. "'
I jump on the semantics?
That's a really aggressive turn of phrase.
Thanks for pulling focus there, Bones.
"Pulling. '"Is that an aggressive word too?
Okay, what?
Did you two plan this?
Paranoia.
That is paranoia.
Since this is a truth zone, I will tell you the truth.
We didn't plan anything.
- You're telling the truth.
- He's guessing, Bones.
We're going to a ceramics class, and we're all gonna make something.
Time's up.
Look. 
Sweets can't really tell ifsomeone's lying.
I'm tel I i ng you.
He's playing with our minds.
There's an area of study called neurolinguistics which proposes... that subconscious eye movements and body language...
- tell a well-trained observer ifthe subject is lying.
- Yeah, well, I don't believe it.
Huh. 
I don't believe it.
- Is that Tripp's bike?
- Yeah.
Looks like Danny's gonna finally get what he wants, huh?
Do me a favor, Son. 
Take it easy a couple times around before you blast off.
- I know, Dad. 
Ease into it.
- Hey, can I get a picture?
Let's get a picture. 
Look at that.
Number one on the Slam Bolt racing team.
- You gotta feel good about that.
- I'm not talking to you without my lawyer present.
That goes for all of us. 
Look, you-you I can replace.
Do not wreck my bike.
Well, Lenny, I'm thinking your boy isn't gonna relax into this.
Well, ifDannygets a chance to grab the brass ring, he's gonna take it.
Okay. 
Watch this, Bones.
He's gonna decelerate right before the turn and just slingshot right through it.
I don't see the deceleration part.
No, no.
Danny's down!
- Come on. 
Let's get in there!
- No! 
No!
No!
- Get in there!
- Put that out!
No, Danny.
Yes. 
We're at the Belleville Practice Track on Highway 64.
Send an air ambulance now.
There's been a motorcycle accident.
- Where's your father?
- He's at the house.
He's already had two heart attacks.
He doesn't need to be here for this.
- Excuse me.
- Seems like a crime to mess with such a sweet bike, huh?
- Yeah, a crime, like murder.
- Right. 
I-I-I just meant the bike itself. 
It's-
No, I get it.
You like bikes.
These rotors are laser cut and honed.
Very exact.
Bend one just a little, and when this baby gets to speed, the rotor hits a brake pad.
- Separates a little farther, and the next thing you know- 
- Yes. 
We saw.
- So it couldn't have been an accident.
- You mean, "Oops...
I accidentally stuck a piece of metal through this tiny hole and pushed it with all my might"?
- So anyone could have done this?
- Anyone who's familiarwith motorcycles- and was a killer.
Whywould anyone want to kill Danny?
You can't be near the evidence.
I'm sorry.
See what else you can find, will you?
Recovering ink traces on plastic and polymers is problematic.
So I am using a new technique.
A little ofthe reagent eugenol, and... voilà.
- "EE S APERS DO CO."' 
- Does that mean anything toyou?
- Korean restaurant?
- Unlikely. 
There are obviously missing letters.
We need to place the consonants most likely to appearwith this configuration ofvowels... and vowels to consonants.
That is an enormous amount ofvariables, Zack.
- Shh. "Lee Snappers Doll Company. "' 
- Don't think so.
"Freenewspapers. com. "' "Keen snappers don't come. "'
- Definitely not.
- "Kneescrapers. com. "'
Oh, my God. 
That's it.
Motokneescrapers. com.
- How did you do that?
- Process of elimination.
You realize I have no idea what it means.
It's the Web site run by the journalist that Tripp put in a wheelchair.
So this man's pen was found on the murdervictim.
Or it fell in the mud when the bodywas dumped.
I'm enjoying this.
The last time I threwpots, I was in Colombia with the Arhuaco Indians.
Last time I did something like this, I was in nursery school.
Well, we love it.
- Don't we, Lance?
- Yes.
Well, I love mywork.
But I'm not gonna talk about that right now... even though we think a paraplegic killed Tripp Goddard.
- That sounds fascinating.
- April.
Oopsie.
- Dr. Sweets says that you work with tropical fish.
- Yes.
I love fish.
They're just like people.
No. 
No, they're not actually.
People can't breathe underwater.
She's funny.
I am? 
What?
- Whyis that funny?
- I don't think she meant that literally, Bones.
- Oh.
- It's their eyes.
You can tell so much from eyes.
I n humans, a retinal scan is as specific as a fingerprint.
No, no. 
Their souls.
You can see their little souls.
I don't understand. 
You believe that fish have souls?
Yes. 
You can see it in their coloring.
It's
- It's a reflection ofwho they are.
Their coloring has developed over millennia as a way to deal with predators.
April just means they're beautiful.
Don't tell me what I mean, Lance.
- I mean they have souls.
- Okay.
Hey. 
Look what I'm making.
You've done this before.
- No.
- You have.
You really think that's good?
- Yes. 
Very.
- Yours is good too, April.
I'm not talking to you.
You think that's funny?
- Are they fighting?
- Just focus on your pot there.
I'm with patients, April.
Oh, no. 
No patients tonight.
Just us people makingpots.
You can't apologize forme, Lance.
Can we please just move on?
No. 
I just-
I meant I believe that all creatures- people, fish, dogs- we're all connected.
We all share the same stuff that makes life so beautiful and precious.
On a quantum level, that's true.
Although the word "stuff"' is not accurate.
See?
What? 
I have great respect foryour fish.
Admittedly, I might relate to other things more.
He kills about a thousand people a night.
Yeah. 
In a video game, April.
They're not real.
Hey, Sweets.
Your, uh, thing there is droopy.
Wow. 
Look at myhorse.
- Wow.
- That's amazing, Agent Booth.
Very impressive.
Yes, it is.
Ooh, Bones. 
I'm sorry.
Oh! 
Geez.
Hey, Sweets, I apologize.
This whole ceramic thing is great.
Oh.
Yeah. 
This is fun.
I'll tellyou one thing.
Sweets didn't get anylast night.
They're too young to be in a serious relationship.
I n agrarian societies, young couplings made sense.
The partnership was for survival.
But today-
You know, you can play the field and not plow it.
- That was distasteful.
- What?
- I like April though.
- She talks to fish. 
Okay?
I'm with Sweets on this one.
Brennan.
- Hey, it's Zack.
- Hi, Zack.
The pry bar from the garage is not the murderweapon.
It's a pry bar like this one, but not this one.
The deep parallel grooves on the interior border...
- are not a match.
- What about the blood?
Apparently the toluene caused a false positive.
What about the vertical fracture on the frontal suture?
- That's the forehead.
- Yeah. 
I didanotherscraping ofthe fracture... and I found a sliver of glass with a mastic film on it.
The mass spec shows it as a nitrate of silver.
So, I thinkwe're looking for some kind of a mirror.
Good. 
Thankyou.
Foundit earlythis morning.
No way ofknowing how long it's been here.
My guess is it was stolen, driven around some, then stripped for parts.
- VI N number matches?
- Oh, it's the victim's truck, all right.
Hey. 
I gotta tell you.
I love working this one.
I'm usually looking over some battered old heap for evidence... but the vehicles on this case- theyare sweet.
- Got anything else for me?
- They're testing mud on the bottom of the vehicle... on the chance it might match where the victim was dumped.
- Pry bar.
- Huh?
- Pry bar.
- Yep. 
Covered in blood.
I blame the Stooges.
- Excuse me?
- The Three Stooges.
Theywere always bashing each other in the heads... with hammers and bricks and stuff and never got hurt.
- People think they can do it too.
- Thanks.
All I'm saying is that killings like this are Stooge related.
- Booth.
- Yeah?
The side mirror.
Long jagged edge.
He was standing by his truck.
Someone came up behind him and hit him with the pry bar.
- Falls forward into the mirror.
- Fracturing his fronto-nasal suture.
- Huh?
- Forehead.
Booth, this suggests onlyone assailant.
Can we get some luminal, check the mirror for blood?
Well, we're not hurting for blood around here. 
Check this out.
Love these. 
Whoa. 
Oh.
Don't needanyluminal forthis.
So he was killed, loaded in the box, driven to the mud and dumped.
That's physically impossible for a paraplegic to do.
Ifit's only one murderer, it wasn't Garth. 
Do we have any prints?
Just the victim's. 
But we did find some hair in the boxwhere the bodywas placed.
It's dyed. 
We're checking for the exact brand and color.
The roots are gray and short.
Lenny Fitz dyes his hair.
Whywould Lenny kill his most valuable rider?
I'd like the record to reflect that my client has been drinking.
That's an understatement.
And that he's rejecting my advice not to speak toyou at this time.
- Drinking a lot there, Lenny? 
Maybe out of guilt?
- I lost a son, Agent Booth.
A son.
So excuse me for feeling bad about that, all right?
Doyou mean your biological son orTripp Goddard?
Lady, I loved Tripp Goddard like a son.
But Danny
- Dannywas my son.
- There's a difference.
- I'm confused.
Is my client a person of interest in this or an actual suspect?
- And in which death?
- That depends upon whether or not the same person... killed both Danny Fitz and Tripp Goddard.
You can't honestly think that I killed either one ofthem.
- Well, we found Tripp's truck.
- Where?
Clearing in Jackson State Park.
Forensic evidence shows that Tripp was murdered in the mechanics' bay... and his bodywas transported in his own truck.
What's that got to do with my client?
There's forensic evidence tying him to the body.
What you got? 
A nail clipping?
A piece of dried snot? 
A hair?
No. 
We got forensic evidence.
Lenny, when was the last timeyou saw Tripp?
I told you.
At the victory party.
You shook hands with him, sat next to him at the bar. 
Did you make out a little?
I hugged him.
Any other questions about how trace evidence from my client... mayhave wound up on Tripp's remains?
- Just hold him on suspicion. 
That's all.
- Look. 
I didn't kill Tripp.
I can get a court order to release him in less than an hour.
Look. 
Whywould I kill somebody I just signed a business deal with?
Wait. 
Y-You what?
Mr. Fitz signed 10% of his company over to Tripp.
- You mean the motorcycle team.
- No. 
Mr. Fitz means the beverage company.
Slam Bolt energy drinks?
- Why offer so much?
- 'Cause he was the best.
So I offeredhim a piece ofthe business... as an incentive to race exclusively for Slam Bolt.
- And everybody's happy.
- Who isn't happy?
Every other motorcycle team.
- Did Tripp Goddard sign?
- I only got him the contract that night.
- And then hugged him.
- Soyou signed it, but he didn't.
We don't know.
You haven't found the contract, haveyou?
We'll be in touch.
Sexualjealousyas a motive didn't pan out.
- Professional jealousy was looking pretty good.
- Until Dannywas killed.
- But money- that's always good.
- How much money?
Well, company like Slam Bolt?
Millions is my guess.
Tripp Goddard could have been attacked by more than one person.
- The skull shows that as a possibility.
- No "changies,"' Bones. 
Okay?
Pry bar to the back ofthe skull, mirror to the face. 
No take-backs. 
One killer.
I'm just saying that maybe Philippa and Danny didn't like it... when their father signed over a chunk oftheir family companytoTripp Goddard.
Well, it's a good business decision.
Look. 
Garth wants Tripp dead for putting him in a wheelchair.
Philippa wants Tripp dead for grabbing up a hunk ofherfather's company.
Two killers again?
You said no changies and no take-backs.
Doesn't scan.
You know?
I mean, whywould either Garth or Philippa want Danny dead?
- You're the motive guy.
- Look. 
We found Garth's Kneescrapers pen in the mud.
- That doesn't prove anything.
He gave them out to everybody.
It's right here, Bones.
It's right in front of us, but I just- I can't get it.
That whole business with changies and take-backs- that's not real, right?
No.
I have another question.
Is there anything more we can learn from the murderweapon?
No, that's a you question.
My question is how did the murderer know about the secret mudhole?
Look. 
I know I was breaking the rules when I drove my truck on national park land.
- But, I mean, this girl
- Didn'tyou see her?
- I really don't care about that.
Come on, man. 
Have a heart.
Look. 
I got it about the girl the minute I saw her, okay?
We all do things for the girl.
What doyou need to talk to me for?
- I need to know howyou found out about that mudhole.
- Oh.
"Oh,"' what?
- I don't want to be a rat.
- Look, sport.
I don't care about the girl or the mud or the 4x4.
Hardly anyone knows about that place... and someone dumped the body there.
My friend told me about it.
- I need a name.
- He didn't do it. 
He's in a wheelchair.
Your friend's name Garth Jodrey?
- How'd you know that?
- Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Special.
This is the shaft ofthe pry bar.
It's made oftempered steel with a shiny chrome covering.
The murderweapon we found on Tripp's truck.
Yes. 
As you can see, the chrome is compromised.
Putting chrome on a pry bar is not a good example offunctionality.
- Maybe it was decorative.
- Those are blood flecks.
- From the victim?
- There's no way ofknowing until a D.N.A. test is done.
The blood flecks begin approximately 25% ofthe way up the handle.
- What does that indicate?
- I have absolutely no idea.
Come on. 
Choke?
Didn't anybody playsoftball orbaseball?
Okay.
It's a choke up.
For somebody not strong enough to swing the entire length of the bat.
Of course.
It's a choke up.
To foreshorten the fulcrum.
Yes. 
I see... because the murdererwas weaker than the full-grown male human... forwhom the pry barwas designed.
Right. 
Like a girl.
Now, when I batted, I always had to choke up.
Then, of course, I kicked ass.
- Sweet.
- I'll have Cam check the D.N.A.
- Excuse me. 
Temperance?
- April, hi.
I, uh, wanted to talk toyou woman to woman, ifthat's possible.
It is possible because we are both women.
Seeing you the other night, it made me realize thatyou have a very objective eye.
- Thankyou.
- And you got to see Lance and me together.
And I wonder if- ifyou might tell me whatyou think.
Well
- Could you be more specific in the question?
Um-
Fish.
Fish choose their mates based primarily on color gradations.
Two gouramis, for example, one male and one female... they'll mate if they're both vibrant blue.
Now, ifthe male becomes paler... which can happen over the course oftime... the female becomes nonreceptive to the male.
Even aggressive.
Doyou see where I'm going with this?
Sweets is too pale?
Yes.
But let's sayyoung instead of pale and go with that.
Is there an age difference?
Yeah. 
I'm almost 27... and Lance just turned 23.
What's the age difference between you and Booth?
Uh, fi- fiveyears, but no.
- We are not blue fish.
- Oh.
But still, he's very firm once you get him out ofthat suit, but- 
- A pale blue.
- Robin's egg really.
I'm a vibrant, vibrant cobalt.
Not literally.
I mean, we're both mostly pink in reality.
No, I understand.
Did we seem good together toyou?
April, it was only one evening.
We got the D.N.A. results from the murderweapon.
- Sex?
- Oh, so much more than adequate. 
It was wonderful really.
I mean, he's a nighttime person, and I'm most enthusiastic in the morning... but that's not the problem.
Oh. 
Sorry.
You were- You were talking about work.
D.N.A. says the murderer's female.
Excuse me.
We're here about a mud bath?
No. 
We got a sworn statement here from Garth Jodrey... that Philippa Fitz took him to the mudhole...
- three years ago.
- To have sex.
Same mudhole that Tripp was dumped in.
I can giveyou a sworn statement that Garth took me to that mudhole.
- Ooh, I slid that one right by her.
- What?
You just admitted thatyou had prior knowledge to the location of a mudhole.
- No changies.
- No take-backs.
Answer nothing without prior confirmation from me.
You killed Tripp becauseyour father was about to sign the company over to him.
- What?
- Don't respond in anyway.
We have D.N.A. evidence that shows thatyou swung the pry bar into Tripp's head.
According to the forensic report... the sample was verysmall... and was totally used up during the course ofthe test.
- It's an accurate test.
- But it can't be repeated.
And my client has a twin brother.
Juries hate D.N.A. evidence and twins.
What's that sound?
I believe that's reasonable doubt starting its engines.
We have evidence that the same pry bar was used to sabotage Tripp's motorcycle.
A common tool left in a semipublic area... in a situation that could have resulted from incompetence rather than sabotage.
You sabotaged the bike to kill Tripp... but he signed the contract before he could ride the bike... and die the way he was supposed to.
Soyou killed him with the prybar... loaded him onto his own truck and dumped him in the mud puddle.
Everything was great untilyourbrother... rode the bike that you sabotaged.
- You don't ride someone else's bike. 
Danny knew that.
- Philippa.
You killed him accidentally, butyou did kill him.
I loved my brother.
Don't speak, please.
Are we free to go, orwould you like to waste more ofthe taxpayers' money?
- She did it.
- You may get a prosecutor to lay a murder charge... but a jurywill never bring home this baby the wayyou want it to.
You're right.
- Butyou know what? 
I'm still gonna make the arrest.
- To what end?
- You can't win.
- To let everybody know what Philippa did... including her father.
I'm okaywith whatyou did there.
Mm-hmm. 
Yeah.
Thanks a million, Bones.
Don't get mad.
I'm just saying that...
I just like it betterwhen we catch 'em and they go tojail.
Yeah, well, sometimes it can get messy, Bones.
But the point is it gets done.
This one started out in a pit of mud and ended in a pit of mud.
That's very damn poetic ofyou.
Oh, hey, guys.
I didn't know you'd be here.
What doyou think, Bones?
He's lying.
You want to sit down?
Not really.
- Lying again.
- Come on. 
Sit down.
Okay.
- April dump you?
- How do you know that?
He's got the "dumpee" look on his face.
I'm a trained psychologist.
I mean, I saw this coming.
It's not like the signs eluded me.
So I prepared myself mentally for it.
Hey, Sweets.
- Bones and I, we're going bowling tonight.
- Yes.
Yes, bowling.
You know what? 
You want to come, to go bowling with us at the bowling rink?
- Alley.
- Bowling alley. 
The bowling alley.
You know, fish aren't actually sentient.
There's a reason people say "cold as a fish. "'
Me, I'm a dog person.
I think that has meaning.
- Don'tyou?
- Sure.
You thinkApril was pretty?
Mmm, not at all.
You're lying, Dr. Brennan.
- I appreciate the effort. 
Thankyou.
- Come on, Sweets.
What doyou saywe go bowling?
I got him. 
Come on.
- Nah. 
That's all right.
- Come on.
What's that mean?

The gps says it's right up here.
You don't even know how to use that thing.
The hell I don'T.
We're here.
we just drove an hour through the woods to find more woods that look just like the woods we drove through.
Eureka.
That's mud.
No,this is like,um... yeah,it's pretty much mud.
And it smells like rotten eggs.
Mmm,sulfur.
Very therapeutic.
And you expect me to believe you've never been here before?
A friend of mine told me about this place and swore me to secrecy, but this is my first time.
In mud.
come on in.
It's nice.
All right.
Something's poking me.
This mud is reputed to have amazing romantic properties.
I think I got it.
No,I think I'd notice if you got it.
whoa,geez.
This hot spring averages a temperature of 105 degrees, but it can spike to near boiling,which is why we discourage bathers.
Especially those who illegally drive 4x4 vehicles into a national park.
So someone was boiled to death?
Or had a heart attack or passed out,etcetera,etcetera.
The remaining flesh will have to be macerated.
What's that?
Uh,don't ask.
The flesh either has to be boiled off or eaten by dermestid beetles.
Bones,why can't you just say "cleaned"?
The sulfur encrusted the bone.
You see the staining?
So it's been there a long time?
Not necessarily.
So why do you even have to bring it up then?
Signs of blunt force trauma.
What's that mean?
That means he didn't pass out and boil to death on his own.
I'm going to need all of the mud.
Excuse me?
Get a tanker truck out here,and suck it up, so we can filter it back at the jeffersonian.
Humerus is 36.5 centimeters.
Medium build.
Late 20s,early 30s.
He's broken this bone before.
Is she serious about the mud?
Serious as a gas attack.
Heart attack,bones.
Serious as a heart attack.
The description's too general to get anything from a missing person's report.
Triangular depression in the calvarium.
Anterior longitudinal one fracture.
Grazed cortical bone in c1.
There's a patterned impression in the bone.
How many times was he hit,and by what?
More than once by A... square pipe?
Does that exist?
In my experience,people hit people with anything they can pick up and swing.
He was attacked from behind?
What?
There's a vertical impaction fracture to his glabella and frontonasal suture.
Same weapon?
It doesn't appear so.
I've seen this before.
Really? 
Great. 
Where?
From sharpened stone weapons in "neandertall" skeletons.
I'm thinking not so relevant in this case.
The blow to the front of the head would cause a severe laceration.
There were no bloodstains around the mud bath.
Indicating the body was dumped there postmortem.
Zack,regarding the neanderthals...
"neandertalls."
What was the context of those killings?
Accepted scenarios indicate a single individual attacked by two or more assailants.
Then we're looking for two or more murderers.
Bones Season03 Episode10 The Man in the Mud
***not sure about time of death yet.
It was definitely a murder.
Definitely. 
Probably by two assailants.
What a shock for that couple,huh?
I mean,they slide naked into the hot mud bath and a skeleton hand pokes her in the,you know...
- anus.
- Bones!
What? 
It's a clinical term for that part of the body,booth.
Dr. Brennan?
Agent booth?
Would it be fair to say that you use work to avoid confronting personal issues?
- Oh,why? 
Because I don't want to talk about,you know...
- the anus.
You really like that word,don't you?
Do you two ever discuss anything that's not attached to work?
Well,it's better than talking about,you know... the anus?
What is it with you two?
Well,sweets could be right.
I mean we talk a lot about work.
I talk about my kid.
Because he was almost kidnapped during a case.
Uh,my father-- we talk about him.
Because agent booth arrested him for murder.
Okay,what are you trying to get at here?
Your inability to share your personal lives.
I-I thought that was obvious.
Okay,that was snotty.
I don't respond well to snotty.
After a case,sometimes... we have a drink or coffee.
Booth has pie. 
I don't like pie.
You-you really should just...give it a chance.
I find it too sweet.
Okay,there!
We talked about pie.
Nothing to do with work.
It is better when we discuss murder.
I'd like to see you guys in a social situation.
A situation where work is a taboo subject.
What,are you going to send us to a restaurant and watch through a one-way mirror?
I'm still not having pie.
No,an evening out with my girlfriend and me.
they need someone to buy them beer.
You want us to go on a double date?
Listen,why don't you just go on the internet like all the rest of the kids?
Okay,if it goes well,I'll withdraw my concern.
I'll release you back into your environment.
What are we,brook trout?
Fine.
agent booth?
Unless you think that's too much to prove?
Fine. 
I'll show him I have nothing to prove.
Bring it on,sweets.
so far I have three old beer cans,an indian arrowhead, 73 cents in change and a partially melted sharpie.
The victim was braised like osso buco.
The flesh was falling off the bone.
I put time of death between ten days and two weeks.
I found stress fractures and degenerative changes in the facet joints.
Fits with the hypertrophy of the cervical muscles.
I found microscopic tearing.
But he had to sustain this position to cause that kind of wear and tear.
Death by yoga?
Is that skull ready for me yet?
It should be ready.
You can take it out of the boiler any time.
Or you could do that for me because I will never,ever do that.
There are fractures of the pelvis,compression fractures of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.
Multiple metacarpal and metatarsal fractures... what was he,a crash test dummy?
The injuries to the vertebrae,tibia,femur are consistent with landing on the feet after falling from ten to 20 feet.
Like jumping out of a tree?
The damage to the scapula and acromion resulted from a low fall but forward movement from between 16 to 20 miles per hour.
Falling off a bicycle?
These injuries are more recent.
Fractured and scored patella and torn retinaculum.
Okay,even I didn't get that one.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
Sounds like he was doing a good enough job on his own.
Yes,okay,dr. 
Sweets,I'll ask him.
How is wednesday night? 
Are you free?
Oh,what,to have our big doubleate with our psychiatrist?
Just one more evening and then maybe we won't have to see him anymore.
Fine. 
Wednesday is fine.
I can't wait.
Does he want me to get you a corsage?
Wednesday is fine.
We'll meet you there.
Yeah,I'm looking forward to meeting her.
Okay,bye.
This might be fun.
His girlfriend works with tropical fish.
- Tropical fish?
- Yeah.
This is just weird.
Where are we meeting?
At their ceramics class.
What? 
No. 
You're kidding.
No. 
Why would I be kidding?
He said it was a good idea to have a common activity.
Ceramics? 
I thought the whole point of therapy was to give us peace of mind, not drive us crazy.
hey,it's angela.
- Hey,angela.
- Hey.
I did a rendering of our victim's face.
We're checking him against any reports of missing persons.
Oh,wait a second. 
That's tripp goddard.
Tripp goddard?
A motorcycle racer.
Oh,I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls.
That would explain the wrist and neck injuries on zack's report.
Have him confirm with dentals.
Yeah,I don't appreciate the "girls" comment.
Uh,tripp won a huge motorcycle race about two weeks ago.
That fits time of death.
That would have been the super grand prix out in virginia.
Tripp won in the final two laps after some kind of accident took out the front-runner.
Girls,huh?
It's not about the machine,it's about the man.
I mean,sure you need a great bike but a great rider on a crap bike is still going to win.
Riders say it's about the rider;
mechanics say it's the machine.
You know what I say?
It's about whoever signs the paychecks.
Ah,yes,and that would be you.
Yes,it would,and don't forget it.
Excuse me.
Fbi. 
Special agent booth.
This is here is dr. 
Temperance brennan from the jeffersonian.
We're looking for someone who might be able to tell us a little bit about tripp goddard.
Uh,well,I'm philippa fitz.
And tripp rides for our family team,slam bolt.
- What did tripp do?
- Who are you?
Garth jodrey.
What does that mean?
Oh,racers,when they...they lean real low into the corners,their-their knees,they scrape the asphalt.
That would explain his knee injuries.
No one has seen tripp since after the super grand prix.
Where did he go?
After a big win,he usually takes off in his truck and... climbs mountains,swims oceans,no one really knows for sure.
Can I help you?
Mr. Goddard is dead.
What? 
What happened?
We believe he was murdered.
Who would kill tripp?
I don't know.
Well,the fans loved him.
Everybody else hated him.
Get lost,garth.
Daddy,please.
No,I want him out of here,philippa.
Garth doesn't seem to think that tripp is the good ol' boy and you do.
He's got his reasons.
The wheelchair for one.
Tripp put him in that wheelchair?
It was an accident,during a race,a couple of years ago.
Well,you can't honestly believe that garth had anything to do with this.
I mean,how? 
He's in a wheelchair.
With help,obviously.
When was the last time you saw tripp?
The victory party after the race.
I saw him get in his truck and leave around midnight.
Great. 
I'm going to need to know the make,the model,the year,license plate of the truck.
Anything you need,we're here.
Just find the bastard who did this to him.
Okay,that's danny fitz.
I tell you,I would have loved to have decked tripp like that after our race, only I was in a coma for a few days.
Another fitz?
Yeah,lenny's son,philippa's twin brother.
All right,watch this.
Danny's got the race in the bag.
Final lap,tripp does that.
A classic inside-out block pass.
Is he allowed to do that?
Only if it's an accident.
Slam bolt would've taken first and second against flame-spark if tripp hadn't clipped danny.
There's someone named flame-spark?
Yeah,flame-spark spark plugs.
It's slam bolt's rival team.
I saw a little daylight.
It looked like danny was going wide,so I went for it.
I mean,it is a bummer when somebody loses the front of their bike like that,but,um... what are you gonna do?
Danny had that race in the bag.
Tripp did the same thing to you,didn't he?
Yeah.
Well,I guess tripp didn't learn anything from the time he did it to me.
Danny fitz was he at the victory party?
Yeah,absolutely.
Brave face for the press.
Did danny leave before or after tripp?
About the same time.
What about you?
I took off right after.
you're good friends with danny,aren't you?
You mean are we good enough friends to kill tripp together?
You know,I'm pretty sure I don't have to say anything without a lawyer.
it's not going to work.
What?
Dropping loud pieces of metal to hurry me up.
I need the skull so I can compare tool marks to potential murder weapons.
You're just gonna have to wait.
Titanium,magnesium and heat-treated boron particulates are embedded in these skull fractures.
what?
That's a unique and exotic combination of metals not found in any of these.
you know,it is possible that these particulates aren't from the tool.
I mean,not from the tool alone.
I don't understand.
Handmade racing motorcycles are made from these metals.
So the particles could have gone from the bicycles to the tools to the victim.
It's not a bi-cycle; it's a motorcycle.
Bi-cycle. 
Two wheels. 
The term applies.
drop those.
Drop them.
I mean it,zack. 
Bombs away.
don't know what that proves.
It proves I don't handle irritation as well as I'd like.
Can I pick these up now?
No.
You can pick one up-- the most likely culprit.
A narrow instrument-- no more than an inch-- caused the injuries.
Okay.
Strain-- the crushing,tearing,shearing¡a equals the change in dimension divided by the original dimension.
I do bugs and slime;
I don't do arithmetic.
An elongated rod with... this cross-section is the most likely culprit.
Good. 
Good job,zack.
Am I king of the lab?
We both are.
let's go tell cam.
Okay,now that... that's gotta hurt.
Wait. 
Here it comes again.
I mean,look at that.
Oh,watch it.
Watch out. 
Watch out... 
Boom!
Let the record show that agent booth is taunting my client by repeatedly showing footage of his traumatic accident.
Don't say accident,man.
Tripp did that to me on purpose.
Well,how fast were you going at the time of your incident?
I don't know exactly.
I was accelerating through 160.
Tripp was accelerating faster-- see there?
Again,with taunti.
Why was tripp so much better than you?
Taunting.
I'm not taunting,mr. 
Smalls.
I'm restating an objective fact.
Tripp had a better bike.
He had maybe 20 horses on me.
So you get tripp's bike now,right,mr. 
Fitz?
I didn't kill tripp for his motorcycle.
Why did you kill him?
Full stop there,cowboy.
All right,don't sweat it there,princess.
All right,any other reason why you'd want to get rid of tripp?
- No.
- Danny... certain things you hide make you look guilty.
A couple years back,tripp was going out with my sister.
Cheated on her with a groupie.
It came to blows.
Who won?
I did,for once.
Knocked him on his ass.
And you defended her honor.
Danny and philippa are twins,agent booth.
They're very close.
He cheated on your sister,forced you to crash.
How would you exactly describe your relationship?
We were the best of friends.
As your lawyer,I must caution you that sarcasm doesn't show up in the transcript.
Best be avoided.
Look,I'm sorry tripp's dead,but I'm not exactly grieving.
You feel me?
Bones,he's not afraid of me at all.
Well,it's hard to scare someone who rides around a track at 200 miles an hour.
Now her,I like.
You want to go out sometime?
Danny,restrain yourself.
No,she doesn't want to go out with you.
Let me speak for myself.
Murder suspect here,bones.
The wound at the front of the head or the back?
Back.
It couldn't be both?
No.
The blow to the front of the head was from a sharp tool.
Sharper than round,but blunter than sharp.
What?
That actually made sense to me.
You two have beespending way too much time together.
Can you estimate the amount of force?
In the back of the head,length undetermined,a width of 3.8 centimeters, approximately a thousand pounds of force.
So a lot.
Half a ton.
Which is a lot.
That actually isn't very much.
All right,now I'm back in a physics class I want to ditch.
A boxer's fist can land with double that force.
A big,meaty fist in a glove.
Yeah,with a force spread out over a hell of a lot more than 3.8 centimeters.
Correct.
It wouldn't take all that much force to crush a skull with this.
So,we haven't eliminated anyone from our list of suspects?
Plus,we don't know what that's a cross-section of, and we don't knowat wh caused the damage to the front of the face.
What exactly made you two come in here,crowing "king of the lab"?
I'm gonna go back and look at very small things under my very large microscope.
I can probably identify the type of tool off this cross-section.
Do it and call booth.
See if it's of any use to him.
Boys.
I don't have the weapon.
But I microwaved the fabric samples and used gas sensors to analyze... all right,all right... just,let's just cut to the chase there. 
Okay,mr. 
Wizard?
I have identified what was on the victim's clothing.
Fine. 
I'll take anything at this moment.
What is it?
It's toluene.
It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil.
How is that supposed to help us?
Every mechanic in the world uses that stuff.
I need a weapon,do you hear me?
A weapon.
You know,I'm feeling really underappreciated today.
All right,well,you know what?
You can suck it up,buttercup.
Booth?
Toluene.
It's also excellent for cleaning up blood.
So,if you killed someone here,and they bled a lot...
The drain.
Check this drain for blood.
Blood suspended in toluene might be testable for dna.
Tell hodgins he did a good job.
I'll tell hodgins he did a good job if...
I'm waiting.
I hate when you do this.
Do what?
You don't talk.
Sometimes you hate when I talk,so it's a double-edged sword.
Bones doesn't mind sitting in silence,do you?
I hate it.
Why do you think that is?
He gets bored.
You're right,I do,I get bored.
You should see him on stakeouts,he talks and talks... well,it's very interesting.
Is it always about work?
No.
You're lying.
Oh,come on. 
How do you know that?
I have special training in how to tell when people are lying.
Is that true?
See,if you were me,you would know.
you're lying to protect your partner.
I understand that.
But let's agree amongst ourselves that this is a truth zone.
Is something bothering you?
it's this whole... going on a date thing.
- No,it's not a date.
- It's not a date.
It's a social outing for the purpose of professional evaluation.
Come on! 
Ceramics?
I'm not that kind of a guy,all right?
What do we say we go,you know,bowling,or to a firing range,or climbing a wall.
Oh,right,mething you're good at.
A movie! 
All right?
Or dinner,dinner and a movie.
Somewhere that I don't have to make something.
What? 
What "ooh"?
Well,what sweets would do in this situation is he'd jump on word usage.
He's going to ask you why you're resistant to "making."
I jump on the semantics?
That's a really aggressive turn of phrase.
Thanks for pulling focus there,bones.
"Pulling," is that an aggressive word,too?
Okay,what? 
Did you two plan this?
Paranoia. 
That is paranoia.
Since this is a truth zone,I will tell you the truth.
We didn't plan anything.
You're telling the truth.
He's guessing,bones.
We're going to a ceramics class and we're all going to make something.
Time's up.
Look,sweets can't really tell if someone's lying;
I'm telling ya he's playing with our minds.
There's an area of study called neurolinguistics which proposes that subconscious eye movements and body language tell a well-trained observer if a subject is lying.
Yeah,well,I don't believe it.
I don't believe !
Is that tripp's bike?
Yup.
Looks like danny's going to finally get what he wants,huh?
Do me a favor,son.
Take it easy a couple times around before you blast off.
I know,dad. 
Ease into it.
Hey,can I get a picture?
Yeah,let's get a picture.
Look at that,number one on the slam bolt racing team¡a you've got to feel good about that.
I'm not talking to you without my lawyer present.
That goes for all of us.
Now,look,you-- you I can replace.
Do not wreck my bike.
Well,lenny,I'm thinking your boy isn't going to relax into this.
Well,danny gets a chance to grab the brass ring,he's gonna take it.
Okay,watch this,bones.
He's going to decelerate right before the turn and just slingshot right through it.
I don't see the deceleration part.
No,no!
- Danny's down!
- We got a rider down!
Come on,let's get in there!
No! 
No! 
No!
get in there.
no,daddy.
Yes,we're at the belleville practice track on highway 64.
Send an air ambulance now.
There's been a motorcycle accident.
where's your father?
He's at the house.
He's already had two heart attacks.
He doesn't need to be here for this.
Seems like a crime to mess with such a sweet bike,huh?
Yeah,a crime like murder.
Right,I-I just meant the bike itself,it'S... no,I get it. 
You like bikes.
These rotors are laser-cut and honed,very exact.
Bend one just a little,and when this baby gets to speed, the rotor hits the brake pad,separates a little farther,
- and the next thing you know...
- yes,we saw.
So it couldn't have been an accident?
You mean,"oops,I accidentally stuck a piece of metal through this little tiny hole and pushed with all my might"?
So anyone could have done this?
Anyone who was familiar with motorcycles.
And was a killer.
Why would anyone want to kill danny?
You can't be near the evidence.
I'm sorry.
See what else you can find,will you?
Recovering ink traces on plastic and polymers is problematic, so I am using a new technique.
A little of the reagent eugenol and... voil?
"E-s-apers do co."
Does that meaning anything to you?
Korean restaurant?
Unlikely.
There are obviously missing letters.
We need to place the consonants most likely to appear with this configuration of vowels, and vowels to consonants.
That is an enormous amount of variables,zack.
Lee snappers doll company.
Don't think so.
Free newspapers dot com.
Keen snapers don't come.
Definitely not.
Knee scrapers dot com.
Oh,my god. 
That's it.
How did you do that?
Process of elimination.
You realize I have no idea what it means?
It's the web site run by the journalist that tripp put in a wheelchair.
So this man's pen was found on the murder victim.
Or it fell in the mud when the body was dumped.
I'm enjoying this.
The last time I threw pots,I was in columbia with the arhuaco indians.
The last time I did something like this,I was in nursery school.
well,we love it.
- Don't we,lance?
- Yes.
Well,I love my work.
But I'm not going to talk about that right now.
Even though we think a paraplegic killed tripp goddard.
That sounds fascinating.
April.
Oopsey.
Dr. Sweets said that you work with tropical fish.
Yes. 
I love fish.
They're just like people.
No. 
No,they're not,actually;
people can't breathe under water.
She's funny.
I am? 
Wha... 
Why is that funny?
I don't think she meant that literally,bones.
It's their eyes.
You can tell so much from eyes.
Well,in humans,a retinal scan is as specific as a fingerprint.
No,no,their souls.
You can see their little souls.
I don't understand.
You believe that fish have souls?
Yes.
You can see it in their coloring.
It's a reflection of who they are.
Their coloring has developed over millennia as a way to deal with predators.
April just means they're beautiful.
Don't tell me what I mean,lance.
I mean they have souls.
Okay.
look what I'm making.
You've done this before.
No.
You have.
You really think that's good?
Yes. 
Very.
Yours is good,too,april.
I'm not talking to you.
you think that's funny?
Are they fighting?
Just focus on your pot there.
I'm with patients,april.
Oh,no,no patients tonight.
Just us people making pots.
You can't apologize for me,lance.
Can we please just move on?
No. 
I just...
I meant I believe that all creatures-- people,fish,dogs-- we're all connected.
We all share the same stuff that makes life so beautiful,and precious.
On a quantum level,that's true.
Although the word "stuff" is not accurate.
See?
What? 
I have great respect for your fish.
Admittedly,I might relate to other things more.
He kills about a thousand people a night.
Yeah. 
In a video game,april. 
They're not real.
Hey,sweets,your,uh,thing there is droopy.
Look at my horse!
That's amazing,agent booth.
very impressive.
Yes,it is.
ooh,bones,I'm sorry.
Oh,geez... hey,sweets,I apologize.
This whole ceramic thing is great!
Yeah. 
This is fun.
Tell you one thing,sweets didn't get any last night.
They're too young to be in a serious relationship.
In agrarian societies,young couplings made sense.
The partnership was for survival,but today... you know you can play the field,and not plow it.
- That was distasteful.
- What?
I liked april though.
She talks to fish,okay?
I'm with sweets on this one.
brennan.
Hey,it's zack.
Hi,zack.
The pry bar from the garage is not the murder weapon.
It's a pry bar like this one but not this one.
The deep parallel grooves on the anterior border are not a match.
What about the blood?
Apparently,the toluene caused a false positive.
What about the vertical fracture on his frontal suture?
That's the forehead.
Yeah,I did another scraping of the fracture and I found a sliver of glass with a mastic film on it.
The mass spec shows it as nitrate of silver, so I think we're looking for some kind of mirror.
Good. 
Thank you.
Found it early this morning.
No way of knowing how long it's been here.
My guess is,it was stolen,driven around some,then stripped for parts.
Vin number matches?
Oh,it's the victim's truck,all right.
Hey,I've got to tell you.
I love working this one.
I'm usually looking over some battered,old heap for evidence, but the vehicles on this case... they are sweet!
You got anything else for me?
They're testing mud on the bottom of the vehicle on the chance it might match where the victim was dumped.
Pry bar.
Pry bar. 
Yep.
Covered in blood.
I blame the stooges.
Excuse me?
The three stooges.
They were always basng each other on the heads with hammers and bricks and stuff and never got hurt.
People think they can do it,too.
Yeah,thanks for that.
All I'm saying is that killings like this,are stooge related.
- Booth.
- Yeah?
The side mirror.
Long,jagged edge.
He was standing by his truck,someone came up behind him and hit him with the pry bar.
Falls forward into the mirror... fracturing his frontonasal suture.
- Forehead.
- Forehead.
Booth,this suggests only one assailant.
Can we get some luminol,check the mirror for blood?
We're not hurting for blood around here.
Check this out.
Love these-- whoa!
Don't need any luminol for this.
So he was killed,loaded in the box,driven to the mud and dumped.
It's physically impossible for a paraplegic to do.
If it's only one murderer,it wasn't garth.
Do we have any prints?
Just the victim's,but we did find some hair in the box where the body was placed.
It's dyed.
We're checking for the exact brand and color.
The roots are gray.
It's short.
Lenny fitz dyes his hair.
Why would lenny kill his most valuable rider?
I'd like the record to reflect that my client has been drinking.
That's an understatement.
And that he's rejecting my advice not to speak to you at this time.
Drinking a lot there,lenny,maybe out of guilt?
I lost a son,agent booth.
A son.
So excuse me for feeling bad about that,all right?
Do you mean your biological son,or tripp goddard?
Lady,I loved tripp goddard like a son,but,danny... danny,was my son.
There's a difference.
I'm confused.
Is my client a person of interest in this or an actual suspect,and in which death?
Well,that depends upon whether or not the same person killed both danny fitz and tripp goddard.
You can't honestly think that I killed either one of them.
Oh,we found tripp's truck.
Where?
A clearing in jackson state park.
Forensic evidence shows that tripp was murdered in the mechanic's bay, and his body was transported in his own truck.
What's that got to do with my client?
There's forensic evidence tying him to the body.
Whatcha got,a nail clipping?
A piece of dried snot?
A hair?
No,we got forensic evidence.
Lenny,when was the last time you saw tripp?
I told you. 
At the victory party.
You shook hands with him?
Sat next to him at the bar?
Did you make out a little?
I hugged him.
Any other questions about how trace evidence from my client may have wound up on tripp's remains?
Just hold him on suspicion,that's all.
Look,I didn't kill tripp.
I can get a court order to release him in less than an hour.
Look,why would I kill somebody I just signed a business deal with?
Wa. 
You what?
Mr. Fitz signed ten percent of his company over to tripp.
You mean the motorcycle team?
No,mr. 
Fitz means the beverage company.
Slam bolt energy drinks?
Why offer so much?
'Cause he was the best.
So I offered him a piece of the business as an incentive to race exclusively for slam bolt.
And everybody's happy.
Well,who isn't happy?
Every other motorcycle team.
Did tripp goddard sign?
I only got him the contract that night.
And then hugged him.
So,you signed it,but he didn't?
We don't know.
You haven't found the contract,have you?
We'll be in touch.
Sexual jealousy as a motive didn't pan out,professional jealousy was looking pretty good... until danny was killed.
But money-- that's always good.
How much money?
Well,company like slam bolt?
Millions is my guess.
Tripp goddard could have been attacked by more than one person.
The skull shows that as a possibility.
No changies,bones,okay?
Pry bar to the back of the skull,mirror to the face.
No take backs. 
One killer.
I'm just saying that maybe philippa and danny didn't like it when their father signed over a chunk of their family company to tripp goddard.
Well,it's a good business decision.
Look,garth wants tripp dead for putting him in a wheelchair, philippa wants tripp dead for grabbing up a hunk of her father's company.
Two killers again?
You said no changies and no take backs.
Doesn't scan.
You know,I mean,why would either garth or philippa want danny dead?
You're the motive guy.
Look,we found garth's knee scrapers pen in the mud.
Well,that doesn't prove anything.
He gave them out to everybody.
it's right here,bones.
It's right in front of us,but I just... 
I can't get it.
The whole business with changies and take backs-- it's not real,right?
No.
I have another question.
Is there anything more we can learn from the murder weapon?
No,that's a you question.
My question is,how did the murderer know about the secret mud hole?
Look,I know I was breaking the rules when I drove my truck on national park land, but,I mean,this girl... didn't you see her?
I really don't care about that.
Come on,man,have a heart.
Look,I got it about the girl the minute I saw her,okay?
We all do things for the girl.
So,what do you need to talk to me for?
I need to know how you found out about that mud hole.
Oh,what?
I don't want to be a rat,you know.
Look,sport,I don't care about the girl,or the mud,or the 4x4.
Hardly anyone knows about that place,and someone dumped the body there.
My friend told me about it.
I need a name.
He didn't do it. 
He's in a wheelchair.
Your friend's name garth jodrey?
How did you know that?
Special agent seeley booth.
Special.
This is the shaft of the pry bar.
It's made of tempered steel with a shiny chrome covering.
The murder weapon we found on tripp's truck.
Yes.
As you can see,the chrome is compromised.
Putting chrome on a pry bar is not a good example of functionality.
Maybe it was decorative.
Those are blood flecks.
From the victim?
There's no way of knowing until a dna test is done.
The blood flecks begin approximately 25% of the way up the handle.
What does that indicate?
I have absolutely no idea.
Come on.
Choke?
Didn't anybody play softball or baseball?
Okay.
It's a choke up.
For somebody not strong enough to swing the entire length of the bat.
Of course,it's a choke up.
To foreshorten the fulcrum.
Yes,I see.
Because the murderer was weaker than the full grown male human for whom the pry bar was designed.
Right. 
Like a girl.
Now,when I batted,I always had to choke up.
Then,of course,I kicked ass.
Sweet.
I'll have cam check the dna.
Excuse me? 
Temperance?
April,hi.
I,uh,wanted to talk to you,woman to woman,if that's possible.
It is possible because we are both women.
Seeing you the other night,it made me realize that you have a very objective eye.
Thank you.
And you got to see lance and me together.
And I wonder if... if you might tell me what you think.
Well,could you be more specific in the question?
Um... fish.
Fish choose their mates based primarily on color gradations.
Two gouramis,for example-- one male and one female¡a they'll mate if they're both vibrant blue.
Now,if the male becomes paler-- which can happen over the course of time¡a the female becomes non-receptive to the male,even aggressive.
Do you see where I'm going with this?
Sweets is too pale?
Yes.
But let's say young instead of pale and go with that.
Is there an age difference?
Yeah. 
I'm almost 27,and lance just turned 23.
What's the age difference between you and booth?
Uh... five years,but,no,we are not blue fish.
But still,he's very firm once you get him out of that suit,but... a pale blue?
Robin's egg,really.
I'm a vibrant,vibrant cobalt.
Not literally. 
I mean,we're both mostly pink in reality.
No. 
I understand.
Did we seem good together to you?
April,it was only one evening.
We got the dna results from the murder weapon.
Sex?
Oh,it was much more than adequate. 
It was wonderful,really.
I mean,he's a night time person,and I'm most enthusiastic in the morning, but that's not the problem.
Sorry.
You were... you were talking about work.
Dna says the murderer was female.
Excuse me?
We're here about a mud bath?
Now,we got a sworn statement here from garth jodrey that philippa fitz took him to the mud hole three years ago.
To have sex.
The same mud hole that tripp was dumped in.
I can give you a sworn statement that garth took me to that mud hole.
Ooh,I slid that one right by her.
What?
You just admitted that you had prior knowledge to the location of a mud hole.
No changies.
No take backs.
Answer nothing without prior confirmation from me.
You killed tripp because your father was about to sign the company over to him.
- What?
- Don't respond in any way.
We have dna evidence that shows you swung the pry bar into tripp's head.
According to the forensic report,the sample was very small, and was totally used up during the course of the test.
It's an accurate test.
But it can't be repeated.
And my client has a twin brother.
Juries hate dna evidence and twins.
What's that sound?
I believe that's reasonable doubt starting its engines.
We have evidence that the same pry bar was used to sabotage tripp's motorcycle.
A common tool left in a semi-public area in a situation that could have resulted from incompetence rather than sabotage.
You sabotaged the bike to kill tripp,but he signed the contract before he could ride the bike and die the way he was supposed to.
So,you killed him with the pry bar,loaded him onto his own truck and dumped him in the mud puddle.
Everything was great until your brother rode the bike that you sabotaged.
You don't ride someone else's bike.
Danny knew that.
Philippa.
You killed him accidentally,but you did kill him.
I loved my brother. 
I... don't speak,please.
Are we free to go,or would you like to waste some more of the taxpayers' money?
She did it.
You may get a prosecutor to lay a murder charge, but a jury will never bring home this baby the way you want it to.
You're right.
But you know what?
I'm still going to make the arrest.
To what end?
You can't win.
To let everybody knows what philippa did,including her father.
I'm okay with what you did there.
Yeah,thanks a million,bones.
Don't get mad.
I'm just saying that I just like it better when we catch them and they go to jail.
Yeah,well,sometimes it can get messy,bones,but the point is,it gets done.
This one started out in a pit of mud and ended in a pit of mud.
that's very damn poetic of you.
Oh,hey,guys.
I didn't know you'd be here.
what do you think,bones?
He's lying.
You want to sit down?
Not really.
Lying again.
Come on,sit down.
Okay.
april dump you?
How do you know that?
He's got that dumpee look on his face.
I'm a trained psychologist.
I mean,I saw this coming.
It's not like the signs eluded me.
So,I prepared myself mentally for it... hey,sweets,bones and I-- we're going bowling tonight.
Yes. 
Yes. 
Bowling.
You know what? 
You want to come?
To go bowling with us at the bowling rink?
Alley.
Bowling alley. 
The bowling alley.
You know,fish aren't actually sentient.
There's a reason people say "cold as a fish."
Me? 
I'm a dog person.
I think that has meaning,don't you?
Sure.
You think april was pretty?
Not at all.
You're lying,dr. 
Brennan.
I appreciate the effort. 
Thank you.
Come on,sweets.
What do you say we go bowling?
I got him. 
Come on.
- No,it's all right.
- Come on.

The GPS says it's right up here.
- You don't even know how to use that thing.
- The hell I don't.
We're here.
We just drove an hour through the woods to find more woods that look just like the woods we drove through.
- Eureka.
- Ew. 
That's mud.
No. 
This is like, um...
- It's pretty much mud.
- Smells like rotten eggs.
Mm, sulphur.
Very therapeutic.
And you expect me to believe you've never been here before?
A friend of mine told me about this and swore me to secrecy. 
This is my first time.
In mud.
Come on in. 
It's nice.
All right.
Mm. 
Something's poking me.
This mud is reputed to have amazing romantic properties.
Mm. 
I think I got it.
No, I think I'd notice if you got it.
Oh, jeez.
This hot spring averages 105 degrees, but it can spike to near boiling, so we discourage bathers.
Especially those who illegally drive 4x4 vehicles into a national park.
- So someone was boiled to death?
- Or had a heart attack or passed out.
The flesh will have to be macerated.
- What's that?
- Don't ask.
The flesh either has to be boiled off or eaten by dermestid beetles.
Can't you just say "cleaned"?
Sulphur encrusted the bone.
See the staining?
- So it's been there a long time?
- No.
- Why bring it up, then?
- Signs of blunt-force trauma.
- What's that mean?
- He didn't boil to death on his own.
- I'm going to need all the mud.
- Excuse me?
Get a tanker truck out here and suck it up so we can filter it at the Jeffersonian.
Humerus is 36.5cm.
Medium build. 
Late 20s, early 30s.
He's broken this bone before.
- Is she serious about the mud?
- Serious as a gas attack.
Heart attack, Bones.
Serious as a heart attack.
Description's too general to try a missing persons report.
Triangular depression in the calvarium, anterior longitudinal one fracture, grazed cortical bone in C1.
- There's a patterned impression in the bone.
- How many times was he hit and by what?
More than once by a... square pipe?
Does that exist?
People hit people with anything they can swing. 
He was attacked from behind?
- Mm...
- What?
There's a vertical impaction fracture to his glabella and frontonasal suture.
- Same weapon?
- It doesn't appear so.
- I've seen this before.
- Great. 
Where?
From sharpened stone weapons in "Neandertal" skeletons.
I'm thinking, "Not so relevant."
A blow to the front of the head would cause a severe laceration.
- No bloodstains around the mud bath.
- So the body was dumped post mortem.
About the Neanderthals...
- "Neandertals".
- What was the context of those killings?
Accepted scenarios indicate a single individual attacked by two or more assailants.
Then we're looking for two or more murderers.
- No time of death yet.
- It was definitely a murder.
- Probably two assailants.
- What a shock for that couple.
They slide naked into the hot mud bath, and a skeleton pokes her in the...
- Anus.
- Bones!
- It's a clinical term for that part of the body.
- Dr Brennan... 
Agent Booth.
Would it be fair to say you use work to avoid confronting personal issues?
- Because I won't talk about?
- The anus.
- You like that word.
- Do you discuss anything apart from work?
- It's better than talking about...
- The anus?
- What is it with you two?
- Sweets is right. 
We talk a lot about work.
- I talk about my kid.
- Almost kidnapped during a case.
My father.
We talk about him.
Because Agent Booth arrested him for murder.
What are you trying to get at here?
Your inability to share your personal lives.
I thought that was obvious.
OK, that was snotty.
I don't respond well to snotty.
After a case, sometimes we have a drink or coffee.
Booth has pie.
I don't like pie.
- You really should just... give it a chance.
- I find it too sweet.
OK, there. 
We talked about pie.
Nothing to do with work.
It is better when we discuss murder.
I'd like to see you guys in a social situation where work is a taboo subject.
- You gonna send us to a restaurant?
- I'm still not having pie.
An evening out with my girlfriend and me.
- They need someone to buy them beer.
- You want a double date?
Why don't you go on the internet like all the rest of the kids?
If it goes well I'll withdraw my concern.
Release you back into your environment.
What are we, brook trout?
Fine.
Agent Booth? 
Unless you think that's too much to prove.
Fine. 
I'll show him I have nothing to prove.
Bring it on, Sweets.
So far I have three old beer cans, an Indian arrowhead, 73 cents in change, and a partially melted Sharpie.
The victim was braised like osso bucco.
Flesh falling off the bone.
Time of death between ten days and two weeks.
I found stress fractures and degenerative changes in the facet joints.
Fits with the hypertrophy of the cervical muscles. 
I found microscopic tearing, but he had to sustain this position to cause that kind of wear and tear.
Death by yoga?
- Is that skull ready for me?
- You can take it out of the boiler.
Or you could do that for me, because I will never, ever do that.
There are fractures of the pelvis, fractures of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, multiple metacarpal and metatarsal fractures...
What was he, a crash-test dummy?
The injuries to the vertebrae, tibia and femur are consistent with landing on the feet after falling from 10 to 20 feet.
Like jumping out of a tree?
The damage to the scapula and acromion was from a low fall, but forward movement between 16 to 20 miles per hour.
- Falling off a bicycle.
- These injuries are more recent.
Fractured and scored patella and torn retinaculum.
Even I didn't get that one.
Why would anyone wanna kill him?
He was doing a good enough job on his own.
Yes, Dr Sweets. 
I'll ask him.
How's Wednesday night? 
Are you free?
To have our big double date with our psychiatrist?
One more evening, and maybe we won't have to see him any more.
Wednesday's fine. 
I can't wait.
Does he want me to get you a corsage?
Wednesday is fine. 
We'll meet you there.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting her.
OK, bye.
This might be fun.
His girlfriend works with tropical fish.
- Tropical fish?
- Yeah.
- This is weird. 
Where are we meeting?
- At their ceramics class.
- What? 
No. 
You're kidding.
- Why would I be kidding?
He said we need a common activity.
Ceramics? 
I thought the point of therapy was to give us peace of mind, not drive us crazy.
Hey, it's Angela.
- Hey, Angela.
- Hey.
I did a rendering of our victim's face.
We're checking missing persons.
- Wait. 
That's Tripp Goddard.
- Tripp Goddard?
The motorcycle racer.
I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls.
That explains the wrist and neck injuries on Zack's report. 
Have him confirm with dentals.
I don't appreciate the "girls" comment.
Uh, Tripp won a huge motorcycle race about two weeks ago.
- That fits time of death.
- That's the Super Grand Prix in Virginia.
Tripp won after some kind of accident took out the frontrunner.
- Mm.
- Girls, huh?
It's not the machine, it's the man.
Sure, you need a great bike.
But a great rider on a crap bike - still gonna win.
Riders say it's the rider, mechanics say the bike. 
I say it's who signs the checks.
- And that would be you.
- Yes. 
And don't forget it.
Excuse me. 
FBI Special Agent Booth. 
Dr Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian.
We're looking for someone who can tell us about Tripp Goddard.
Uh, well, I'm Phillipa Fitz, and Tripp rides for our family team, Slam Bolt.
- What'd he do?
- Who are you?
- What does that mean?
- Racers, when they lean into the corners,
- their knees scrape the asphalt.
- Explains his knee injuries.
No one has seen Tripp since the Super Grand Prix.
Where did he go?
After a big win he takes off in his truck, climbs mountains, swims oceans.
No one knows for sure.
Can I help you?
Mr Goddard's dead.
What? 
What happened?
We believe he was murdered.
Who would kill Tripp?
I don't know.
Well, the fans loved him.
Everybody else hated him.
- Get lost, Garth.
- Daddy, please.
No. 
I want him out of here, Phillipa.
Garth doesn't think Tripp was a good ol' boy. 
You do.
- He's got his reasons.
- The wheelchair.
- Tripp put him in that chair?
- Racing accident a couple of years ago.
You can't believe Garth had anything to do with this. 
I mean, how?
With help.
- When did you last see Tripp?
- Victory party after the race.
I saw him get in his truck and leave around midnight.
Great. 
I need the make, the model, the year, license plate of the truck.
Anything you need, we're here.
Just find the bastard who did this to him.
Ha-ha-ha. 
Yeah.
OK, that's Danny Fitz.
I would've loved to have decked Tripp after our race, only I was in a coma.
- Another Fitz?
- Lenny's son, Phillipa's twin brother.
Watch this.
Danny's got the race in the bag.
Final lap, Tripp does that.
Classic inside-out block pass.
- Is it allowed?
- If it's an accident.
Slam Bolt were first and second ahead of Flame Spark till Tripp clipped Danny.
- There's someone named Flame Spark?
- Flame Spark spark plugs. 
Slam Bolt's rival.
I saw a little daylight. 
Looked like Danny was gonna go wide, so I went for it.
It's a bummer when somebody loses the front of their bike like that, but what can you do?
- Danny had that race in the bag.
- Tripp did the same thing to you, didn't he?
Yeah. 
Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn anything from the time he did that to me.
- Danny Fitz, was he at the victory party?
- Yeah, absolutely. 
Brave face for the press.
- Did Danny leave before or after Tripp?
- About the same time.
- How about you?
- I took off right after.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You're good friends with Danny, aren't you?
- Good enough friends to kill Tripp together?
You know, I'm pretty sure I don't have to say anything without a lawyer.
- It's not going to work.
- What?
Dropping loud pieces of metal to hurry me up.
I need the skull to compare tool marks to murder weapons.
You're just gonna have to wait.
Titanium, magnesium and boron particulates are embedded in these skull fractures.
- Mm...
- What?
That's an exotic combination of metals not found in any of these.
It is possible these particulates aren't from the tool. 
Not the tool alone.
- I don't understand.
- Racing motorcycles use these metals.
The particles could have gone from bicycles to tools to victim.
It's not a bicycle.
It's a motorcycle.
Bicycle. 
Two wheels.
The term applies.
Drop those. 
Drop them.
I mean it, Zack. 
Bombs away.
- I don't know what that proves.
- Proves I don't handle irritation well.
- Can I pick these up now?
- No.
You can pick one up.
The most likely culprit.
A narrow instrument, less than an inch, caused the injuries.
OK.
Strain - the crushing, tearing, shearing - equals the change in dimension divided by the original dimension.
I do bugs and slime, I don't do arithmetic.
An elongated rod with... this cross-section is the most likely culprit.
Good. 
Good job, Zack.
Am I king of the lab?
We both are.
Let's go tell Cam.
Ouch.
OK, now that...
that's gotta hurt.
Wait, here it comes again.
Look at that.
Oh, watch it. 
Watch out, watch out. 
Ooh. 
Boom.
Let the record show Agent Booth is taunting my client, repeatedly showing footage of his traumatic accident.
- Accident? 
Tripp did that to me on purpose.
- How fast were you going at the time?
- Don't know. 
I accelerated through 160.
- Tripp accelerated faster. 
See? 
Whoosh.
Again with taunting?
- Why was Tripp so much better than you?
- Taunting?
I'm not taunting, Mr Smalls.
I'm restating an objective fact.
Tripp had a better bike, 20 horses on me.
- You get Tripp's bike now.
- I didn't kill Tripp for his bike.
- Why did you kill him?
- Full stop there, cowboy.
Don't sweat it, princess. 
Any other reason you'd wanna get rid of Tripp?
- No.
- Danny, certain things you hide make you look guilty.
Couple years back, Tripp dated my sister.
Cheated on her with a groupie.
- Came to blows.
- Who won?
- I did, for once. 
Knocked him on his ass.
- You defended her honour.
Danny and Phillipa are twins, Agent Booth.
They're very close.
Cheated on your sister, forced you to crash.
How would you describe your relationship?
We were the best of friends.
As your lawyer, I caution you sarcasm doesn't show up in the transcript. 
Best be avoided.
I'm sorry Tripp's dead, but I'm not exactly grieving. 
You feel me?
Bones, he's not afraid of me at all.
Hard to scare someone who rides around a track at 200 miles an hour.
- Her I like. 
You wanna go out sometime?
- Danny, restrain yourself.
- No, she doesn't.
- Let me speak for myself.
Murder suspect here, Bones.
- The wound at the front or the back?
- Back.
- Couldn't be both?
- No.
The blow to the front of the head was from a sharp tool.
- Sharper than round, blunter than sharp.
- What?
- That actually made sense.
- You spend too much time together.
- Can you estimate force?
- Back of the head, length undetermined.
Width of 3.8cm, approximately a thousand pounds of force.
- So a lot.
- Half a ton.
- Which is a lot.
- It isn't much.
Now I'm back in a physics class I wanna ditch.
- A boxer's fist lands with double that force.
- A big fist in a glove.
With a force spread out over a lot more than 3.8cm.
It wouldn't take much force to crush a skull with this.
So we haven't eliminated anyone from our list of suspects.
We don't know what that's a cross-section of or what caused the damage to the front of the face.
What exactly made you two come in here crowing "king of the lab"?
I'm gonna go look at very small things under my very large microscope.
I can probably identify the type of tool off this cross-section.
Do it and call Booth.
See if it's of any use to him.
- Boys.
- Wow.
I don't have the weapon, but I microwaved fabric samples and used gas sensors to...
All right, let's just cut to the chase there, OK, Mr Wizard?
- I know what was on the victim's clothing.
- Fine. 
I'll take anything.
- What is it?
- It's toluene.
It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil.
How is that supposed to help us?
Every mechanic uses that.
I need a weapon.
Do you hear me? 
A weapon.
You know, I'm feeling really underappreciated today.
You can suck it up, buttercup.
- Booth?
- Ah.
- Toluene.
- It's excellent for cleaning up blood.
So if you killed someone here and they bled a lot...
The drain.
Hey. 
Check this drain for blood.
Blood suspended in toluene might be testable for DNA.
- Tell Hodgins he did a good job.
- I'll tell Hodgins he did a good job if...
I'm waiting.
- I hate when you do this.
- What?
You don't talk.
You hate when I talk.
It's a double-edged sword.
- Bones doesn't mind silence.
- Mm-mm.
- I hate it.
- Why do you think that is?
- He gets bored.
- You're right.
You should see him on stakeouts.
He talks and talks.
- Well, it's very interesting.
- Is it always about work?
No.
- You're lying.
- Oh, come on. 
How do you know that?
I have training in how to tell when people are lying.
- Is that true?
- See, if you were me, you'd know.
You're lying to protect your partner.
I understand.
But let's agree amongst ourselves that this is a truth zone.
- Is something bothering you?
- Oh, it's this whole... going-on-a-date thing.
It's not a date.
It's a social outing for the purpose of professional evaluation.
Come on! 
Ceramics?
I'm not that kind of a guy.
What do you say we go bowling or to a firing range or climbing a wall?
- Right, something you're good at?
- A movie? 
Or dinner. 
Dinner and movie.
- Somewhere I don't have to make something.
- Ooh...
What? 
What, "Ooh?"
Well, what Sweets would do in this situation is he'd jump on word usage.
He'd ask you why you're resistant to making.
I "jump on" the semantics?
That's a really aggressive turn of phrase.
Thanks for pulling focus there, Bones.
"Pulling." Is that an aggressive word too?
- OK, did you two plan this?
- Paranoia.
That is paranoia.
Since this is a truth zone, I will tell you the truth.
We didn't plan anything.
- You're telling the truth.
- He's guessing.
We're going to a ceramics class, and we're all gonna make something.
Time's up.
Sweets can't tell if someone's lying.
He's playing with our minds.
An area of study called neurolinguistics proposes that subconscious eye movements and body language tell a well-trained observer if the subject is lying.
Yeah, well, I don't believe it.
Huh, I don't believe it.
- Is that Tripp's bike?
- Yeah. 
Danny's gonna get what he wants.
Do me a favour, son. 
Take it easy couple times around before you blast off.
- I know, Dad. 
Ease into it.
- Can I get a picture?
Let's get a picture. 
Number one on the Slam Bolt racing team. 
That's gotta feel good.
- I'm not talking to you without my lawyer.
- That goes for all of us.
Look, you, you I can replace.
Do not wreck my bike.
Lenny, I'm thinkin' your boy won't relax into this.
Well, Danny gets a chance to grab the brass ring, he's gonna take it.
Watch this. 
He's gonna decelerate before the turn and slingshot right through it.
I don't see the deceleration part.
No, no...
Danny's down!
- Move! 
Let's get in there!
- No! 
No!
No! 
No.
- Get in there.
- Get that out!
No, Daddy.
We're at the Belleville practice track, Highway 64. 
Forever.

The new cantor of St. Thomas, a believer and a musician.
Hopefully it is good!
Excuse me if I kept you waiting.
The occupations of my office are many and require an iron discipline that I can only receive a few visits.
A musical composition should be of a nature pleasant.

- It 's perfect, Sr.Schuchart.
- Many thanks!
- Not at all.
- I wish you a good day!
- Thank you, too. 
A more 'late!
Welcome! 
Honest and hard working people of distance and closeness.
I do not think that has need me to introduce myself.
They returned again in Leipzig to show all the places of Bach and more 'important to this city.
The convent and school of St. Thomas were founded in 1212.
Therefore the members of the choir are part of a tradition which has nearly 800 years.
Initially, Thomas was a small Romanesque church.

Every day is done different tests with the choir 'cause we sing every Friday night in the Church of St. Thomas, and every Saturday afternoon sung by and Sunday mass.
The members of the choir of St. Thomas originate for the most part from non-church families.
Which for admission, would represent a problem,
But working with spiritual texts, and especially with the great music of these texts, and knowing so 'many things, not there 's almost no member of the choir not be baptized during his time spent in Santo Thomas.
The task of the choir, has above all, in a society 'secular a very important to promote of sacred music.

THE SILENCE BEFORE BACH

So the last time you saw him was two days ago, when he left for work, right?
You hadn't quarreled.
Just a normal morning.
Yes.
Did he seem. ..
Did he seem preoccupied or anxious?
Nothing unusual.
On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very preoccupied, what would you say?
I don't know.
Two .
Is this the first time?
That he hasn't come home?
Any financial problems?
Do you think he had...
Or that he might've had another...
You know, sometimes, men...
They mean no harm.
But they have urges.
At this stage we can't rule anything out.
This kind of thing happens.
More often than you think, you'd be surprised.
If I could just ask you to sign down here.
WELCOME CONFEREN. ..
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non-smoking.
I quit.

What attracts you to sales?
I need a change.

That's me!
Come!
Excuse me, it's for Paul's wife.
Everyone's signed.
Still no word?
"Get well soon"?
It's all we could find.
Send some flowers with it, something simple.
Very good.
Alright.
You know, in life insurance, the fall's our busy season.

No, I'm really happy.
Are the girls there?
Of course.
Time for me to go to bed too.
Alright, then.
Big kiss.

I mean, he died.
It happens.
The company refuses to pay his wife.
They say he made a false declaration.
I'm sorry.
Why? 
There's no reason.
You can't be sorry for everyone.
Not for everyone, I'm sorry for you.
Thanks for the lift.
Want to come in?
Now?
Yeah.
I guess I look like that type.
Like I want to come in.
I don't know.
Maybe you'd like to talk.
Hello?
Yes.
Who is this?
Yes.
I'll wait for you.
Goodbye.

- Hello.
Can I come in?
Yes. 
Sure.
It's weird, it's just like our room.
Exactly the same.
The same, but turned around.
- It 15?
- Yeah, the furniture, the TV, everything.
Except the pictures.
The pictures aren't the same.
I came to apologize for the noise, it's my fault.
That's alright.
I tend to be very loud.
Some people keep it in, but me, it has to come out.
That's OK.
You think so?
Well, in fact, the reason I'm here is that Denis and I...
We wanted to ask you...
Feel free to say no.
But we thought that since you hear us through the wall, maybe you'd like to join us on our side.
Would you like that?
You want me to...
But just to watch.
I mean...
We're not, what do you call it...
How can I put it?
I mean, just to watch.
Goodness, I've embarrassed you.
I'm very sorry. 
I didn't want to.
Forgive me.
No, look, it's just that...
I'm a bit surprised.
Would you like a drink?
I have water.
I'm glad you don't think I'm crazy.
People are so narrow-minded.
I hope you don't think we're perverts or anything.
I mean, to be frank, it would be the first time for us.
Thank you.
Have you ever done it?
No, not really.
You see, we...
I think we're at that stage.
We've been married a while.
And, well...
I mean, after a while sex ....
God, how can I put it?
Well, sex...
You know what I mean, right?
Do I make you feel awkward?
No.
Often people are surprised if a woman talks about it too much.
About sex.
Especially after a certain age.
I find people don't think enough about their sex life.
Maybe they're together, they have problems, they don't know why.
Often it's because of sex.
Don't you think?
Yes.
I guess I'll be going.
Thank you.
I don't know...
Would it be convenient in an hour?
Sure, in an hour would be perfect.
I'm really happy to have met you.
- Diane.
- Louis.
Well then, see you in an hour.
Was he alone?
Yes.
Maybe it wasn't him.
But I think it was.
It's hard to say.
I'm really grateful for what you've done. 
Really.
It's nothing.
It says there's...
A reward of some sort.
Of course.
Here.
- Thank you.
- Could you please stay a bit?
What would you do in my shoes?
I'm sorry.
You're tired. 
You should go to bed, you'll feel better.
Come with me.
Pardon?
Take me where you saw him.
I can't go alone.
It's all I'm asking.
- Hello.
- Come in.
Have a seat.
Don't mind the mess.
Care for a drink?
Yeah, how about a scotch?
Have a look, Diane.
I think there's some left.
You must...
Our proposal must seem a bit strange.
A bit, yes.
It was Diane's idea.
You agreed, Denis!
Yes, but it was your idea.
Well, cheers!
What do you do?
I'm in insurance. 
An advisor.
I used to be in sales too.
Crazy hours.
Now I'm in cement.
Swimming pool decks, courtyards.
We're here for the conference.
We're squeezing in a little vacation too.
I see.
Might as well, while we're still healthy.
That's true.
Here we are, gabbing away.
Diane, put on some music.
His room doesn't answer.
Can I take a message?
Yes.
Do you want to leave a number?
I'll tell him.
Goodbye.
Good evening, can I help you?
No thanks.
I'll be fine.
Here.
I'm tired, Nicole.
I'm tired.

So the last time you saw him was two days ago, when he left for work, right?
You hadn't quarreled.
Just a normal morning.
Yes.
Did he seem...
Did he seem preoccupied or anxious?
Nothing unusual.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being very preoccupied, what would you say?
I don't know.
Two.
Is this the first time?
That he hasn't come home?
Any financial problems?
Do you think he had...
Or that he might've had another...
You know, sometimes, men...
They mean no harm.
But they have urges.
At this stage we can't rule anything out.
This kind of thing happens.
More often than you think, you'd be surprised.
If I could just ask you to sign down here.
WELCOME CONFEREN...
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non-smoking.
I quit.
Do you need a second key?
It's free.
No, that's OK.
Here, it's room 314.
The elevator's on your right.
Sir?
It's on the other right.
Thanks.
What attracts you to sales?
I need a change.
And insurance looks like a very exciting field.
It's always changing.
And since I'm a very dynamic person, when I saw the ad I thought:
That's me!
Come!
Excuse me, it's for Paul's wife.
Everyone's signed.
Still no word?
"Get well soon"?
It's all we could find.
Send some flowers with it, some thing simple.
Very good.
Alright.
You know, in life insurance, the fall's our busy season.
The month of the dead.
Gets people thinking.
Fortunately for us.
But tell me, do you like people?
You mean, in general?
Hello.
Marcel Beaudoin?
I'll give it to you straight.
Your gums are infected.
You see this?
Severe loss of bone support.
- How old are you?
- Sixty- two.
Getting up there.
Look, surgery is always an option.
It's a major operation, but doable.
Do you have a dental plan?
Is it expensive?
It runs to about 14, 15 thou.
15 thousand?
Total reconstruction.
Of course, at your age there are other options.
For $2,000 I'll pull them all and make you dentures.
A nice brand - new smile.
There are worse things in life.
Think it over, but... don't wait too long.
I'll prescribe antibiotics for now.
Come on.
Just a minute.
The test is negative, it turns out.
Maybe...
Maybe it's for the best.
I guess it's for the best.
We'll see.
For now they're putting me up here.
Yeah, it's like a trial period.
No, I'm really happy.
Are the girls there?
Of course.
Time for me to go to bed too.
Alright, then.
Big kiss.
I lo e you too.
The test is negative, it turns out.
Maybe...
Maybe it's for the best.
I guess it's for the best.
Nicole?
Please don't hang up.
I need $15,000 for an operation.
It's my jaw.
Otherwise they'll have to Pull everything out.
Please don't hang up.
Louis Girard, from the JPL Insurance Plus Group.
You signed up for a free information session on... on our different possi... our different life insurance policies.
To start I'll give you your gift.
It's to thank you.
It's very kind to see me.
It's a cell phone.
With hands - free, for the car.
You'll see, it's very practical.
First I'll ask a few questions.
Everything will be confidential.
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Thank s.
Your Golden Age card?
Excuse me?
Your Golden Age discount card.
I'm not...
I'll make an exception, but next time bring your card.
It comes to $9.73.
I'm leaving this message to...
Well, I just wanted to tell you... that, you know, I find your popcorn really good.
I bet people don't often call to tell you that.
They don't tell you when you do something right.
I know because I work with the public.
You know...
That's all.
I hope you have a good day.
Keep it up.
CLOSING SALE
The Slim'N Lift makeover continues!
Here's Alissa's before picture.
Notice how tight her clothes look.
Like they're a size too small.
Now here's Alissa wearing her new Slim'N Lift Supreme.
Alissa, you haven't seen your Slim'N Lift makeover.
Take a look in the mirror.
Oh my God!
Look at me!
I can't believe it!
The change is incredible!
I'm one of those thin girls!
My gosh!
Paul?
MISSING REWARD OFFERED
If your hair's not right, it affects what's under, your brain.
It's a basic principle.
Two hours at the hair salon is like a week down south.
When did you last take a vacation?
I don't know.
A long time ago.
A long time's not the right answer.
A few streaks and you'll be a new person.
People will say, "Chantal, is that you?
"I didn't recognize you!"
Do it for the party.
I'm not going.
You can't do that to me, at the last minute!
I'm just not in to it.
I never know what to say.
Just listen. 
People love to talk about themselves.
They'll think you're so interesting.
I told him you were coming.
- He's Mr. Right.
- So was the last one.
This one's your type.
My type!
What you need is someone to co-sign for you.
A friend, or your partner, someone who knows you well.
A dental procedure isn't something we can...
It doesn't create income or guarantee capital.
Do you understand?
This shows the monthly premium for your age group.
This is the payout in case of accident or death.
The advantage is...
That stuff is all horseshit.
... you don't need a medical.
We fill out the form and you're automatically eligible.
Don't let him con you.
See this?
Maximum protection for your beneficiaries.
No way, Monique, I won't sign.
But if something happens, how'll I manage?
What can happen?
We never do anything.
Madame, what I'm offering you is security, peace of mind.
There's $285.
It's all I could scrape up.
Thank you.
What can I say?
I'll pay you back.
It's the last time.
Don't call me anymore, Marcel.
It's too hard.
Mrs. Simoneau, how are you today?
Why do you never call me?
We don't call because there's no news.
If there is you'll be first to know.
What's being done?
Why's there never any news?
Madame, you have to stop calling every day.
All I can tell you is, we decided the re won't be an official investigation.
Why won't you investigate?
I know how you feel...
Yes but, people don't just disappear like that.
Look, I'll be frank.
This isn't the first case like yours.
Lots of men disappear to change...
Change jobs, change wives...
Even if we find him, what then?
I 'm sorry.
What did you do today, hon?
Well, Daddy worked hard too.
I love you too, sweetie.
As big as the universe.
Well, that's pretty big.
Good night, princess.
Put Mom on, OK?
I'll call tomorrow.
Yeah, me too.
I said, "Me too."
No, there's nobody here.
What's this about? 
I said no.
Look, Isa, listen...
OK, we'll talk tomorrow.
No, that's OK.
I said it's OK.
Give me your best donut.
The best?
Yes, the best.
You must eat one now and then.
Which do you think's the best?
I dunno, it depends.
You don't know.
That one, the white one...
Is it any good?
What's on it?
I don't know, sir.
Well, give me that white one.
Can I help you?
Could I have change for the machine?
I think your plants need watering.
They're plastic.
It's incredible!
Would you like some?
No thanks.
I used to date someone who was allergic.
I need a wake - up call tomorrow.
At 8:00.
Room 314.
All set.
You must get bored at nigh t some times.
No, I like it.
It's quiet.
Here for the conference?
The conference? 
No.
I'm a...
This is my card.
I need it back, it's a prototype.
You're a salesman?
I see myself as an advisor.
Accidents can happen anytime.
What do you think?
I put a line under my name.
It looks good, I guess.
I mean, I don't really know much about business cards.
There's a mistake.
In your name.
There are two s's.
It says Louiss.
I don't believe it!
You can white it out.
They had 2000 printed.
How does that insurance stuff work?
What do you mean?
How do you know what someone's worth?
Like me, how much would I be worth if some thing happened?
Such as?
I don't know, anything.
We'd have to follow the steps, fill out the form.
Well, have a good night.
Good night.
MISSING.
REWARD OFFERED.
Thank you.
Not bad.
I'm fine.
Thanks. 
You too.
- Hello?
- Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.
Thank you.
You sleep OK?
Not bad.
Do you need anything else?
I'm fine.
Alright.
Well...
Have a...
I tell you...
Can it be repaired?
Made in China.
You need little hands...
I dunno...
It'll be $15 for my time.
$10 maybe.
Thanks.
Yes?
Sorry, I must have the wrong address.
No, this is the place.
Come in.
You're the first.
Nobody's arrived yet.
You can sit in the living room.
There's lots of storage space.
It's practical.
The closets are huge.
Would you like to see?
Maybe later.
What's the tattoo?
It's nothing. 
It's silly, I did it when I was 14.
Sort of a pact with my best friend.
She did the drawing.
What is it?
It's the sun.
The guy's arm was in a cast.
You both have the same?
My friend backed out at the last minute.
Can I smoke?
I'd rather you didn't.
I just had the couches cleaned.
But you can go on the back balcony.
No, that's OK.
Are those your kids?
That's what their mother tells me.
We're not together.
Some times you think you know someone.
But really you don't know them at all.
Yeah, I know.
I used to date a guy allergic to peanuts.
At times I found it hard.
Why are we waiting for the others?
Can I offer you a drink?
A beer, a glass of red wine?
Sure.
I found a system.
I need $400.
With $400 I can make the $15,000.
I'll pay you back double, maybe more.
Come on, Nicole.
Don't you think I can beat a machine?
I miss you.
Can we get together?
Alright.
Paul?
You see...
I'm not sure I can come.
I have so much to read.
We'll celebrate next week.
Isa...
She's two.
Think she'll remember in 20 years we celebrated her birthday late?
I'm doing my best.
Isa, I...
I'm doing everything I can.
I never said you had it easy.
No, I'm not impatient.
I said I'm not impatient.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
No, that's OK.
You OK?
Yeah, sure.
He's nice.
Thank you.
What a relief now that he sleeps through!
He look s so much like you!
- The eyes.
- Just like yours!
But he has his father's character.
Poor baby's tired.
Come here.
You must be on cloud nine.
How can I describe it?
It changes everything.
I feel like a real woman now.
When he looks at me, it's like, "Don't leave me, I need you!"
It's amazing.
My God, what happened?
OK, we know you're having fun!
Mrs. Trudel?
Lou is Girard from JPL Insurance Plus Group.
Yes.
How are you?
Good.
Did you have time to think about our talk yesterday?
Look, my role's as an adv...
What I'm offering is peace of mind.
I know, Mrs. Trudel.
Do you have peace of mind?
Think of your family.
Dying's not cheap, and they'll have to pay.
If you like I can...
I can come right over.
The contract takes 5 minutes.
I see.
No, I understand.
Fine.
Thanks again. 
Goodbye.
I wish I could say it's fun, that I'm having fun.
But I 'm not.
I'm kind of bored.
And...
I don't know how to play chess, so people think I'm dumb.
So I think I'm going to leave.
I expected more from that evening.
I'm bitterly disappointed.
Brothers and sisters, death has visited us once again.
Gilles Paré is no longer with us.
Our Creator has freed him from the woes of this world and welcomed him to eternal life.
So today we gather here to celebrate Gilles'...
So today we gather here to celebrate Gilles' joyous arrival to the new life God promises to His children.
It's a chilly time of year.
But I'm well dressed.
I've been thinking about what you said.
Forget what I said.
I lost my first client today.
I mean, he died.
It happens.
The company refuses to pay his wife.
They say he made a false declaration.
I'm sorry.
Why? 
There's no reason.
You can't be sorry for everyone.
Not for everyone, I'm sorry for you.
Thanks for the lift.
Want to come in?
Now?
Yeah.
I guess I look like that type.
Like I want to come in.
I don't know.
Maybe you'd like to talk.
Hello?
Yes.
Who is this?
Yes.
I'll wait for you.
Goodbye.
- Yes?
- Hello.
Can I come in?
Yes. 
Sure.
It's weird, it's just like our room.
Exactly the same.
The same, but turned around.
- It is?
- Yeah, the furniture, the TV, everything.
Except the pictures.
The pictures aren't the same.
I came to apologize for the noise, it's my fault.
That's alright.
I tend to be very loud.
Some people keep it in, but me, it has to come out.
That's OK.
You think so?
Well, in fact, the reason I'm here is that Denis and I...
We wanted to ask you...
Feel free to say no.
But we thought that since you hear us through the wall, maybe you'd like to join us on our side.
Would you like that?
You want me to...
But just to watch.
I mean...
We're not, what do you call it...
How can I put it?
I mean, just to watch.
Goodness, I've embarrassed you.
I'm very sorry. 
I didn't want to.
Forgive me.
No, look, it's just that...
I'm a bit surprised.
Would you like a drink?
I have water.
I'm glad you don't think I'm crazy.
People are so narrow- minded.
I hope you don't think we're perverts or anything.
I mean, to be frank, it would be the first time for us.
Thank you.
Have you ever done it?
No, not really.
You see, we...
I think we're at that stage.
We've been married awhile.
And, well...
I mean, after awhile sex....
God, how can I put it?
Well, sex...
You know what I mean, right?
Do I make you feel awkward?
No.
Often people are surprised if a woman talks about it too much.
About sex.
Especially after a certain age.
I find people don't think enough about their sex life.
Maybe they're together, they have problems, they don't know why.
Often it's because of sex.
Don't you think?
Yes.
I guess I'll be going.
Thank you.
I don't know... would it be convenient in an hour?
Su re, in an hour would be perfect.
I'm really happy to have met you.
- Diane.
- Lou is.
Well then, see you in an hour.
Was he alone?
Yes.
Maybe it wasn't him.
But I think it was.
It's hard to say.
I'm really grateful for what you've done. 
Really.
It's nothing.
It says there's... a reward of some sort.
Of course.
Here.
- Thank you.
- Could you please stay a bit?
What would you do in my shoes?
I'm sorry.
You're tired. 
You should go to bed, you'll feel better.
Come with me.
Pardon?
Take me where you saw him.
I can't go alone.
It's all I'm asking.
- Hello.
- Come in.
Have a seat.
Don't mind the mess.
Care for a drink?
Yeah, how about a scotch?
Have a look, Diane.
I think there's some left.
You must...
Our proposal must seem a bit strange.
A bit, yes.
It was Diane's idea.
You agreed, Denis!
Yes, but it was your idea.
Well, cheers!
What do you do?
I'm in insurance. 
An advisor.
I used to be in sales too.
Crazy hours.
Now I'm in cement.
Swimming pool decks, courtyards.
We're here for the conference.
We're squeezing in a little vacation too.
I see.
Might as well, while we're still healthy.
That's true.
Here we are, gabbing away.
Diane, put on some music.
His room doesn't answer.
Can I take a message?
Yes.
Do you want to leave a number?
I'll tell him.
Goodbye.
Good evening, can I help you?
No thanks.
I'll be fine.
Here.
I'm tired, Nicole.
I'm tired.

You think you know a story, but you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story, you have to go back to the beginning.
~ Season 1 
- Episode 2 ~ "Simply Henry"
- Halt.
- Halt!
There it is.
Val D'Or.
The Valley of Gold.
- What if the French don't show?
- Oh, they'll show.
They'll just be fashionably late.
Your Majesty, look. 
There they are.
What's the plan?
I was to ride down alone and meet the king.
It's a trap. 
What if they mean to lure you down to kill you?
All of you. 
On pain of death.
Stay.
Come on.
The king.
What is thou doing?
- Cousin.
- Cousin.
After you.
After you.
- How do you like my beard?
- You almost look French, you know?
Hear ye. 
Hear ye.
"I, Henry, by the grace of God King of England Ireland and France, do hereby..."
Stop.
I cannot be that while you are here, for I would be a liar.
During this summit, I am simply Henry, King of England.
And I am just Francois.
King of France and Burgundy.
Majesties, may I ask you each to place a hand upon the Holy Bible and swear before God and these princes and lords here gathered that you will be true, virtuous, and loving to each other.
I so swear.
I swear too. 
Of course.
Princess Mary.
May I introduce Prince Henry Philip, your future husband?
Are you the Dauphin of France?
Then I want to kiss you.
Mary.
I have got to get one of these.
Palace of Illusions.
What do you think?
It's incredible, Your Majesty.
It's only painted canvas.
- But real wine.
- Don't drink too much of it, Charles.
Your Majesty.
And now I have a gift for you.
- You embarrass me, brother.
- Oh, no.
And all I can give you in return is this pastry.
What are you thinking, Charles?
I'm thinking that, while I'm here I should behave like the King of France.
Which means?
Which means I shall slip readily into the gardens of others and drink water from many fountains, eh?
Do you see that young woman over there?
Dressed in purple and gold?
Yes.
Her name is Mary Boleyn, the daughter of the ambassador with her sister Anne.
I call Mary my English mare because I ride her so often.
Gentlemen.
Thomas.
Papa.
King Henry noticed you today.
He wants to see you.
Wait.
I must go and tell Anne.
Anne.
What's your name, boy?
Thomas Tallis, Your Majesty.
Tallis. 
Good voice.
- Take a sovereign for your song.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Boleyn.
- What of Buckingham?
In my presence, he has railed against your eminence.
Calling you a necromancer, a pimp.
Accusing you of using evil ways to maintain your hold over the king.
And what did Lord Buckingham say about the king?
He told me he has a greater claim to the throne.
And that as His Majesty has no male heirs, and will have none that he, Buckingham, will succeed to the throne.
But he also told me that he has considered bringing that eventuality forward more quickly.
- In what way?
- By assassinating His Majesty.
You did well to come to me.
But I must warn you, say nothing of this to anyone.
You see that, brother?
In most things, we French excel you.
We have the greatest painters the greatest musicians and the greatest poets.
Most of whom, by the way, live at my court de ma cie.
The greatest philosophical minds, engineers, architects.
And of course, we have the most beautiful women.
You won't deny that, will you?
Even our wrestlers are better than yours.
- Are you sure?
- What?
I said are you sure all your wrestlers are better than mine?
Do you wanna prove it?
What are you suggesting?
I am challenging you to a wrestling match, brother.
No.
You're a coward.
The French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.
- Let's do it now.
- Groom.
- Your Majesty...
- No.
Majesties, gentlemen.
The rules are as follows:
First man to throw his opponent to the ground shall be declared the winner.
- Are you content?
- Yes.
Then fight on.
- What bet will you lay?
- Come on, Henry.
- Two kings, two queens and a fool.
- Who's the fool?
I don't know yet, but it's a full house.
Come on, Your Majesty.
Henry's gonna win.
Whatever happens, he's not gonna win.
- Come on, Henry.
- Come on, Henry, you got him.
Come on. 
Come on.
- Come on, monsieur.
- Yes.
I want a rematch. 
I want a rematch.
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a rematch?
Are you calling me afraid?
Of what am I supposed to be afraid?
- Of me!
- Let's have it then.
I'm not gonna sign this treaty.
I'm not gonna sign it, go and tell them.
- Lf that's what you...
- Go and tell them.
All right.
If you want the world to know that the king is changeable, shallow, intemperate incapable of keeping his word, then, of course, I will go and tell them.
After all, I am merely Your Majesty's humble servant.
- Lady Mary.
- Your Majesty.
I have heard a lot about you.
You've been at the French court for two years.
Tell me.
What French graces have you learned?
- With Your Majesty's permission?
- Granted.
And now I ask his gracious Majesty, the King of England to also sign in good faith, the Treaty of Universal and Perpetual Peace.
Leave.
Forget about the French, the Queen's nephew has been elected.
Now he is not only Charles V, the King of Spain, ...he's also the Holy Roman Emperor.
His dominions are vast, his wealth extraordinary.
And he's only 20 years old.
You will make arrangements to visit him at Aachen. 
Personally.
It may suit us better to do business with him than with the French.
Yes, Majesty.
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.
Your Grace...
What did you think of that performance?
- L...
- Don't be stupid, you're not.
The king's performance at the summit.
How did it strike you?
Personally, I would have wished to have seen a greater more powerful man upon the throne of England.
Someone whose presence would have made the French sit up and come to heel.
I have the way and the means to crush the usurper of my throne as one would crush a revolting spider.
I will make him wish he'd entered the Church after all and left the affairs of the state to those who are born to rule.
You betray me, Boleyn, I'll feed your body to me dogs.
Now, what have you discovered here?
I have it on good authority that the Duke of Buckingham is raising an army.
He says it's to protect him while he tours his Welsh estates where he's not popular.
He's also been borrowing large sums of money.
Buckingham?
Invite him to court for the New Year.
But don't say anything to alarm him.
How are your children?
They're well, thank you, Your Majesty.
I encourage them all at their studies.
Even the girls.
Always the idealist.
At some point, I imagine, it will be considered ordinary enough and nothing strange for a girl to be educated.
I've received a gift from the Duke of Urbino.
It's a book called The Prince, by a Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli.
Yes, I know it.
It's about political opportunism.
It's true.
It's not like your book Utopia.
It's less utopian.
Nevertheless, he asks an important question:
Whether it is better for a king to be feared or loved.
Buckingham is going to try and kill me.
- Your Eminence.
- Lady Blount.
- You are full term?
- In a little while.
- Are you well?
- As can be expected.
Have you some message from His Majesty?
No, none. 
But from your husband.
My husband.
Yes, I have spoken to him.
He finds that he has reconciled to your condition.
Then he won't send me to a nunnery?
He will be made an earl, and given estates.
And my child?
That is for the king to decide whether he will recognise the child.
I'm afraid I can offer you no more comfort than that.
Will you tell the king of my love for him?
My lord, I hereby pledge my allegiance to you and your house.
And do swear to serve you, even unto death.
We thank you from the bottom of our heart.
And in due course, you will find your loyalties richly and properly rewarded.
I thought I should tell you.
I'm being sent to meet the new Holy Roman Emperor.
The king has asked me to draw up a new treaty uniting us against the French.
- You must be very disappointed.
- I am very realistic.
Then I am disappointed.
- Our dreams were very unrealistic.
- Maybe so.
But I will continue to dream them, even if I am alone in doing so.
I fear His Majesty no longer trusts or cares for me as he once did.
Thomas, let me give you a little advice.
If you want to keep the love of a prince, this is what you must do.
You must be prepared to give him the thing you most care for in all the world.
The thing I care for most is my integrity.
What is it you care for most in the world, Your Eminence?
His Grace, the Duke of Norfolk.
Your Grace.
I hope Your Majesty will accept this humble gift for the New Year.
We are very grateful to Your Grace.
Your generosity overwhelms me.
As always.
Lie down.
- Get some linens.
- His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
- It has some words engraved on it.
- Give it to me.
"With humble, true hearts."
Your Grace overwhelms me.
Your words touch me.
They are the greatest gift.
Greater than any riches.
Push, my Lady. 
Push.
Breathe. 
It's coming.
With true and humble heart.
There.
Hold, Your Grace.
What do you want?
Your Grace is arrested on suspicion of treason.
I'm ordered by the king's majesty to take you to the Tower.
You take my advice, gentlemen, you let us pass.
By no means.
And if any of your men should strike against His Majesty's servants in pursuit of their duties that's treason too.
As Your Grace should know.
Your Grace.
You. 
You are only new men.
You don't know anything.
If I am accused of treason I should be judged by a jury of my peers, not by the dogs of butchers.
There's no lord in England who will ever find against me.
Form them up.
I have instituted a Court of High Steward to judge Buckingham's case.
Twenty peers will be appointed to the court.
Norfolk will be first among them.
- Your Majesty, if I may?
- What?
I believe it could be dangerous to find the duke guilty of treason.
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.
On the other hand, he could be found guilty of some lesser offence.
Heavily fined and banished from court.
In that way, he would be disgraced, but his friends and allies would have little cause or occasion to rise against you.
- And that would be the best outcome?
- I believe it would, yes.
And you would see to it that the court come to that decision?
I have every confidence.
As I have in Your Eminence.
Wolsey will set up the court.
Norfolk will head it.
I want you to remind His Grace of his responsibilities.
14-30.
Chase to four, gentlemen.
Ball.
Mary?
Does the king still call for you at night?
No, Papa.
Even though the king is your godfather, when you approach him...
Your Grace.
What do you want?
Only to pass on His Majesty's love.
He appreciates the role you will play at my Lord Buckingham's trial and for all the care you have for His Majesty's well-being.
He also sends you this.
This is my father's ring.
He was executed by His Majesty's father, did you know that?
His Majesty thought you might like to wear it.
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.
And he's going to be received by his godfather, the king.
Your Grace should have a care for his inheritance.
It would be terrible if some action of yours were to deprive him of a father, a title and a ring.
Your Grace.
Your Grace has been accused of treason and of imagining and plotting the death of the king's majesty.
This court of High Steward after reviewing all the evidence against Your Grace finds Your Grace guilty of the charges against you.
No.
And so sentences Your Grace to death at His Majesty's pleasure.
This is your doing.
Butcher's dog.
It's all your doing!
Bastards!
Your Majesty.
God bless you, sir.
Take this, Your Grace.
Traitor.
Do you forgive me?
Your Grace must lie down.
When you stretch out your arms, I will strike.
Stretch out your arms.
I have a son. 
I have a son.
Thank God.
Thank God.
Come on, you charlatan.
I have a son!
I have a son, God.
Can you hear me? 
I have a son.
Your Majesty is to be congratulated on such a happy event.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
The Lady is upstairs.
- Henry, congratulations.
- Thank you, Charles.
- I always knew it wasn't my fault.
- No.
His Majesty has decided to recognise his son.
He will be known for the present as Henry Fitzroy.
And he will have his own establishment at Durham House with a chaplain, officer and a retinue befitting his station.
Thank you.
You should write and thank His Majesty.
I only do his bidding.
The queen. 
The queen.
To my son.
What was your deal with Wolsey?
In return for England not going to war with France I promised him the French vote.
The fact is, Wolsey has gone to Aachen to meet the new emperor.
He obviously means to break the treaty with your king.
In which case we are no longer obliged to deliver our side of the bargain.
In any case, we don't want an English Pope.
We had one once.
He was insane. 
Never again.
The Pope must be an Italian.
That is God's will.
- Your Holiness must swallow it.
- Push it.
My Lady, full of grace, I pray you, I beseech you in all humility for the love I bear for you, and for your son, Jesus Christ.
I pray you give me a child.
A son to fill my empty womb.
I beg you.
In a few weeks, the court will quit Whitehall for Hampton Court.
There's been an incident of Sweating Sickness in the city.
You know how afraid the king is of any illness.
How is the king?
I was sorry to hear of Cardinal Orsini's election as Pope.
You are perpetually sorry, More.
- I wasn't simply being polite.
- Oh, really?
I was not.
As long as there is such corruption in the Church that heretic Luther will continue to gain followers.
I know that if you had been elected he would have worked tirelessly to cleanse the Church of all its evil practises.
Perhaps you think too highly of me, Thomas.
Perhaps, you think too highly of the whole human race.
- Lady Blount.
- Mr. More.
The queen.
My lady.
The queen.
- Uncle.
- Anne.
- Sweet Anne.
- Yes, Papa.
- You know why you're here?
- No, Papa.
- In Paris no one explained.
- Good, it's better that way.
What's happened?
His Majesty is tiring of his French alliance.
It seems he's also tiring of your sister.
He no longer invites her to his bed.
- Poor Mary.
- Poor us.
When she was his mistress, all our fortunes were made.
Now most likely they will fall.
Unless...
Even if he had me, who is to say he would keep me?
It's not just Mary. 
They say that all his liaisons are soon over.
He blows hot, he blows cold.
Perhaps you could imagine a way to keep his interest more prolonged?
I daresay you learned things in France.
How to play his passions?
There's something deep and dangerous in you, Anne.
Those eyes of yours are like dark hooks for the soul.
How was your meeting with the emperor?
Good. 
Productive.
He makes no secret of his antipathy for the French.
He wants to go to war with them and he's desperate for an alliance with Your Majesty.
And in return for our alliance?
There will be a joint invasion of France for the overthrow of King Francis.
And I shall claim the crown.
And once more truly be King of England, Ireland and France.
Just like my forefathers.
Your Eminence has built the most beautiful palace here.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Probably the finest house in England.
I have nothing to compare with it.
Nothing to show more fair.
Your Majesty it is yours.
With the furnishings?
Come on.

- Previously on The Tudors.
- [Henry VIII]:
The King of France has demonstrated his aggressive policies.
He has our Ambassador murdered in cold blood.
These are all just causes for war!
- As a humanist I have an abhorrence of war.
- As a King, I'm forced to disagree.
Why is Henry V remembered?
Because he won the battle of Agincourt.
That victory made him immortal.
- He has no right to any of this. 
I'm a direct descendent of Edward II.
This is my crown and my court.
Not his crown or his court.
- Treason your Grace.
- What if your Majesty could gain more power by peaceful means?
- Which is...?
- Treaty of universal and perpetual peace.
- The Treaty is entirely new in the history of Europe.
- [Queen]: 
You have not answered my nephew's letters.
He advises you not to heed everything Wolsey tells you.
- You are not my Minister.
You are not my Chancellor.
But my wife.
- About the other matter we discussed.
- Which other matter?
- I saved your Master's arse.
Now I want my reward.
And you can arrange it.
- [Queen]: 
I cannot give the King a living son.
The King blames me, he thinks it all my fault and now he does not come to my bed.
- It says if a man marries his brother's wife they die childless.
But you have a child.
- But not a son.
- I am with child.
tdIt is his Majesty's.
- There is to be a summit between King Francis and King Henry near Calais.
That means you will both have the opportunity to meet the King of England.
[Laughing] Mary and Anne Boleyn.
- Pope Alexander is desperately ill.
I can assure the support of the French cardinals, you will be elected Pope.
- It's time. 
My father planned to assassinate Richard III.
He would come before him with a knife secreted about his person.
Your Majesty.
[Yelping]
[Laughing]
- [King]: 
I can't wait for the summit. 
We'll change the world forever.
You and I will be immortal.
- You think you know a story.óRk:
But you only know how it ends.
To get to the heart of the story,
You have to go back to the beginning.

- Halt.
- There it is!
Val D'Or...
The Valley of Gold.
- What if the French don't show?
- Oh, they'll show.
They'll just be fashionably late.
Your Majesty, look!
There they are.
- Au pas!
- What's the plan?
- I was to ride down aloneí]|k and meet the King.
- It's a trap.
What if they mean to lure you down there to kill you?
- All of you!
On pain of death!
Stay!
- The King!
- Cousin.
- Cousin.
Bienvenue en France.
- After you.
- Mais non.
After you.
- How do you like my beard?
- You almost look French, you know?
[Laughter, voices  music]
- Hear ye! 
Hear ye!
I, Henry, by the Grace of God, King of England, Ireland and France, do hereby-- 
- Stop.
I cannot be that while you are here, for I would be a liar.
During this summit I am simply Henry, King of England.
- J'apprécie énormément.
- And I am just...
François,
King of France and Burgundy.
[Applause]
- Your Majesties, may I ask you each to place a hand upon the Holy Bible, and swear before God and these Princes and Lords here gathered, that you will be true, viiSrtuous, and loving toach eother.
- I so swear.
- Moi aussi.
I swear too.
Of course.
[Trumpets]
[Applause]
- Princess Mary, may I introduce
Prince Henri Philippe, your future husband.
- Are you the Dauphin of France?
- Oui.
- Then I want to kiss you.
- Maman! 
Maman!
- Mon Dieu!
- Mary.
- I have got to get one of these.
- The Palace of Illusions.
What do you think?
- It's incredible, your Majesty.
- It's only painted canvas.
- But real wine!
- Don't drink too much of it Charles!
[Fencing]
- And now I have a gift for you.
- Ah!
[Applause]
- You embarrass me, brother.
- Oh no.
And all I can give you in return is this pastry.
[Chirping  reactions of surprise]
- Très amusant.
***
- What are you thinking, Charles?
- I'm thinking that, while I'm here,
I should behave like the King of France.
- Which means?
- Which means...
I shall slip readily into the gardens of others and drink water from many fountains.
- Do you see that young woman over there?
Dressed in purple and gold?
- Yes.
Her name is Mary Boleyn, the daughter of your Ambassador, with her sister Anne.
I call Mary my English mare because I ride her so often.
- Ha!
- Ah! 
Gentlemen.
Monsieur.
- Hurry! 
Hurry!
We need 2 more barrels!
[Chattering voices]
- Excellence.
- Papa.
- King Henry noticed you today.
He wants to see you.
- Wait!
I must go and tell Anne.
Anne.
[Whispering]: 
The King...
[Angelic male singing]
- * Lo li lo lay *
* Lo li lo lay *
* The falcon hath borne *
* My maid away *
- What's your name, boy?
- Thomas Tallis, your Majesty.
- Tallis.
Good voice.
[Sighing]
Take a sovereign for your song.
- Thank you, your Majesty.
[Chattering continues]
- Ah, Boleyn.
- What of Buckingham?
- In my presence he has railed against your Eminence, calling you a necromancer, a pimp, accusing you of using evil ways to maintain your hold over the King.
- And what did Lord Buckingham say about the King?
- He told me he has a greater claim to the throne, and that as his Majesty has no male heirs, and will have none, that he, Buckingham, will succeed to the throne.
But he also told me once that he has considered bringing that eventuality forward more quickly.
- In what way?
- By assassinating his Majesty.
- You did well to come to me.
But I must warn you, say nothing of this to anyone.
[Cheering and yelling]
- Bravo.
- You see that, brother?
In most things, we French excel you.
We have the greatest painters, the greatest musicians and the greatest poets.
Most of whom, by the way, live at my court, Dieu merci.
The greatest philosophical minds, engineers, architects.
And of course, we have the most beautiful women.
You won't deny that, will you?
Even our wrestlers are better than yours!
- Are you sure?
- What?
- I said are you sure?
All your wrestlers are better than mine?
Do you want to prove it?
- What are you suggesting?
- I am challenging you to a wrestling match, brother.
- Non, David.
- You're a coward.
- Merde!
French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.
Parce que tel est notre bon plaisir.
Let's do it now.
- Groom!
- Alors ça commence!
- Your Majesty...
- No.
- Your Majesties...
Gentlemen...
The rules are as follows:
the first man to throw his opponent to the ground shall be declared the winner.
Are you content?
- Yes.
- Then fight on!
- What bet will you lay?
- Go, Henry.
- 2 Kings, 2 Queens and a Fool.
- Who's the Fool?
- I don't know yet, but it's a full house.
- Come on, your Majesty!
- Henry's gonna win.
- Whatever happens, he's not gonna win.
- Go, Henry!
- Come on!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Come on!
- Ha! 
Ha!
- I want a re-match!
I want a re-match!
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a re-match?
- Are you calling me afraid? 
Of what am I supposed to be afraid?
- Of me!
- Let's have it then...
- I'm not going to sign the treaty!
- Ha! 
Ha! 
Ha!
- I'm not gonna sign it!
Go and tell them!
- Alright if that's what-- 
- I said...
Go and tell them!
- Alright!
If you want the wod rito think that the King of England is easily changeable, shallow, intemperate, incapable of keeping his word then of course, I will go tell them.
After all, I am merely your Majesty's humble servant.
Rns|
- Lady Mary.
- Your Majesty.
- I've heard a lot about you.
You've been at the French court for 2 years.
Tell me...
What French graces have you learned?
- With your Majesty's permission?
- Granted.

- Ah!
[Choir]
- And now I ask his gracious Majesty, the King of England, to also sign, in good faith, the Treaty of Universal and Perpetual Peace.

- Leave.
Forget about the French.
The Queen's nephew's been electd.e
Now he's not only Charles V, the King of Spain, he's also the Holy Roman Emperor!
His dominions are vast, his wealth extraordinary.
And he's only 20 years old.
You will make arrangements to visit him at Aachen.
Personally.
It may suit us better to do business with him, than with the French.
- Yes, Majesty.
- Sir Thomas Boleyn, your Grace.
- Your Grace I-- 
- What did you thinks|
of that performance?
- I...
- Don't be stupid!
You're not stupid. 
The King's performance! 
At the summit!
How did it strike you?
- Personally, I would have wished to seen a greater more powerful man upon the throne of England.
Someone whose very presence would have made the French sit up and come to heel.
- I have the way and the means to crush the usurper of my throne as one would crush a revolting spider.
I will make him wish that he had entered the Church after all and left the affairs of the state to those who are born to rule!
If you betray me Boleyn,
I'll feed your body to my dogs.
- Now...
What have you discovered here?
- I have it on good authority... that the Duke of Buckingham is raising an army.
He says it's to protect him while he tours his Welsh estates where he's not popular.
He's also been borrowing large sums of money.
- Buckingham.
Invite him to court, for the New Year.
But don't say anything to alarm him.
tq
How are your children?
- They're well, thank you, your Majesty.
I encourage them all at their studies.
Even the girls.
- Always the idealist.
- At some point, I imagine, it will be considered ordinary enough, and nothing strange for a girl to be educated.
- I've received a gift.
From the Duke of Urbino.
It's a book called The Prince, by a Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli.
- Yes I know it.
It's about political opportunity.
[Chuckling]
- It's true...
It's not like your book, Utopia.
It's less... utopian.
Nevertheless he asks an important question whether it is better for a King to be feared...
Or loved.
Buckingham is going to try and kill me.
